0,"AACHEN, Hans von","(b. 1552, Köln, d. 1615, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aachen/biograph.html,"German painter. His renowned cosmopolitan Mannerist style originated humbly: he first trained with a minor painter in his native Cologne, and he took his name from his father's hometown. He probably joined the Cologne painters' guild before leaving for Italy around 1574.

"
1,"AAGAARD, Carl Frederik","(b. 1833, Odense, d. 1895, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aagaard/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He left his small town for Denmark's capital to study drawing at the Danish Royal Academy; Copenhagen was the centre of a spectacular resurgence of the arts. The art of the first half of the 19th century in Copenhagen was perhaps the greatest achievement of Denmark's Golden Age. The sculptor Bertel 
Thorvaldsen and the painter Eckersberg led an artistic renaissance during the Golden Age that produced, with the establishment of an academy in Charlottenborg in 1754, the artists Christen 
Købke, Jens Juel, Constantin Hansen, Martinus Rørbye, Johan Lundbye, Wilhelm Bendz, and Emanuel Larsen to name a few. The Royal Collections, what was later to become the National Collection after the peaceful transition to a constitutional monarchy, actively supported these new artists, buying these 'modern' pictures the moment they were exhibited."
2,"ABADIA, Juan de la",(active 1470-1490 in Huesca),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abadia/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, formerly known as the Master of Almudévar after a panel representing St Dominic in Almudévar (Huesca). His other known paintings include a St. Catalina (1490), in the church of la Magdalena de Huesca (now lost) and a Saviour, now at the Museum of Zaragoza. He painted works for the cathedral in Jaca between 1473 and 1490."
3,"ABAQUESNE, Masséot","(b. ca 1500, Cherbourg, d. 1564, Sotteville-lès-Rouen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abaquesn/biograph.html,"
French ceramist, who was the first grand-master of the glazed pottery at Sotteville-lès-Rouen (20 years before Bernard Palissy). He took part in the development of the ceramic factory of Rouen. He was the author - among others - of the ceramic triptych representing the Flood (1550, Écouen, Musée de la Renaissance).



"
4,"ABBATE, Niccolo dell'","(b. 1509, Modena, d. 1571, Fontainebleau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abbate/biograph.html,"
Painter of the Bolognese school who, along with others, introduced the post-Renaissance Italian style of painting known as Mannerism to France and helped to inspire the French classical school of landscape painting."
5,"ABBATI, Giuseppe","(b. 1836, Napoli, d. 1868, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abbati/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, who belonged to the group known as the Macchiaioli. Abbati was born in Naples and received early training in painting from his brother Vincenzo. He participated in Garibaldi's 1860 campaign, suffering the loss of his right eye at the Battle of Capua. Afterwards he moved to Florence where, at the Caffe Michelangiolo, he met Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, and the rest of the artists who would soon be dubbed the Macchiaioli."
6,"ABBATINI, Guido Ubaldo","(b. ca. 1602, Città di Castello, d. 1656, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abbatini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and mosaicist. He trained in the Roman studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino. He is principally known for executing fresco decorations in several chapels in Rome to designs by Bernini. Independent commissions, such as the frescoes depicting the Life of Charlemagne (1635-37; Rome, Vatican, Sala di Carlo Magno), reveal, however, that despite his collaboration with Bernini and later with Cortona, his preference was for a restrained classical style, close to that of more conservative contemporaries such as Andrea Camassei and Giovanni Francesco Romanelli."
7,"ABEELE, Pieter van","(b. 1608, Middelburg, d. 1684, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abeele/biograph.html,"
Dutch medallist, one of the best engravers of the Dutch school of the seventeenth century. It is thought that he was also a painter. He lived principally in Amsterdam where he was a pupil of Juriaen Pool (died 1669). His works date from 1622-1677."
8,"ABILDGAARD, Nicolai","(b. 1743, København, d. 1809, Frederiksdal)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abildgaa/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He first studied at the Copenhagen Academy before moving to Rome in 1772. In the company of Swedish sculptor Johan Tobias Sergel and painter John Henry Fuseli he began to move away from the classicism he learned at the Academy. He developed an appreciation for the literature of Shakespeare, Homer and Ossian, legendary Gaelic poet. He worked with themes from Greek, as well as Norse mythology which placed him at the forefront of Nordic romanticism."
9,"ABONDIO, Antonio","(b. 1538, Riva del Garda, d. 1591, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/abondio/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, part of a family of medallists and wax modellers, active in Central Europe. Antonio Abondio worked first in Italy and later for the imperial courts in Vienna and Prague. He worked in an eclectic style drawn from Italian and northern sources. His oeuvre consists principally of some 60 medals, though he also produced some wax portraits (13 of which survive) and a few plaquettes of religious and mythological themes. His son and pupil, Alessandro Abondio (c. 1580-1648), continued his father's work at the imperial court, developing the genre of portraiture in wax. He also made figure subjects. Alessandro's output was highly regarded by collectors."
10,"ACERO Y AREBO, Vicente","(b. ca. 1677, Cabárceno, d. 1739, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/acero/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect who contributed significantly to the design and construction of the cathedrals of Granada, Guadix, Cádiz, and Málaga."
11,"ACHENBACH, Oswald","(b. 1827, Düsseldorf, d. 1905, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/achenbac/biograph.html,"
German painter. He studied at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf, as did his elder brother, the painter Andreas Achenbach (1815-1910), who was the main influence on him other than his teacher, Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863). At a very early stage he began to prepare studies for landscapes in the area around Düsseldorf, sketching boulders, rocks, bushes, trees and people. From 1843 he went on many study tours, visiting Bavaria in 1843 and northern Italy and Switzerland in 1845. The Bavarian and Italian Alps stimulated him to create a unified approach to landscape painting."
12,"ADAM, Lambert-Sigisbert","(b. 1700, Nancy, d. 1759, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adam/lambert/biograph.html,"
French sculptor belonging to a family of sculptors. Originally from Lorraine, the earliest known members of the family to be involved with the arts were Sigisbert Adam, a sculptor, and Lambert Adam, a metal-founder (both active late 17th century). Lambert's son Jacob-Sigisbert Adam spent most of his working life in Nancy, where he undertook the early training of his sons Lambert-Sigisbert Adam (1700-1759), Nicolas-Sébastien Adam (1705-1778), and François-Gaspard-Balthazar Adam (1710-1761). His daughter Anne married Thomas Michel (d. before 1751), a sculptor from Metz; among their children were the sculptors Sigisbert-François Michel (1727-after 1785) and Claude Michel (known as Clodion). The three Adam brothers went to Rome at the start of their careers, Lambert-Sigisbert and Nicolas-Sébastien returning to France to work on the outdoor sculpture at Versailles, among other projects, and François-Gaspard-Balthazar going on to Sanssouci, Potsdam."
13,"ADAM, Nicolas-Sébastien","(b. 1705, Nancy, d. 1778, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adam/nicolas/biograph.html,"
French sculptor belonging to a family of sculptors. Originally from Lorraine, the earliest known members of the family to be involved with the arts were Sigisbert Adam, a sculptor, and Lambert Adam, a metal-founder (both active late 17th century). Lambert's son Jacob-Sigisbert Adam spent most of his working life in Nancy, where he undertook the early training of his sons Lambert-Sigisbert Adam (1700-1759), Nicolas-Sébastien Adam (1705-1778), and François-Gaspard-Balthazar Adam (1710-1761).

14,"ADAM-SALOMON, Antoine-Samuel","(b. 1818, La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, d. 1881, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adam-sal/biograph.html,"
French photographer who was a sculptor in his early career. He exhibited in the Paris Salon, first under his own name and then under the name Adama. Adam-Salomon learned photography in 1858 in Munich; in the following year, he opened his own portrait photography studio in Paris while continuing to sculpt."
15,"ADAM, Albrecht","(b. 1786, Nördlingen, d. 1862, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adam1/biograph.html,"
German painter, part of a family of painters. Albrecht Adam had four sons who were artists: Benno Adam (1812-1892), Franz Adam (1815-1886), Eugen Adam (1817-1880), and Julius Adam (1826-1874). Albrecht's brother Heinrich Adam (1787-1862) was also an artist. Richard Benno Adam (1873-1937) was the grandson of Benno Adam."
16,"ADAM, Robert","(b. 1728, Kirkcaldy, d. 1792, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adam2/biograph.html,"
Scottish architect and designer. Part of a British family of architects active 17th-18th centuries, he is the son of a Scottish architect, William Adam Sr. (1689-1748). He is considered the most important architect of the late eighteenth century in England. Together with his brother James (1730-1794), he transformed Palladian Neoclassicism in England into the airy, light, elegant style that bears their name (Adam style). His major architectural works include public buildings (especially in London), and his designs were used for the interiors of such country mansions as Syon House in Middlesex (now in Hounslow, London)."
17,"ADELCRANTZ, Carl Fredrik","(b. 1716, Stockholm, d. 1796, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adelcran/biograph.html,"
Swedish architect, son of the architect Göran Josuae Adelcrantz (1668-1739). Appointed Supervisor of Court Buildings in Stockholm (1741), he remodeled the riding-master's quarters at Ulriksdal as a theatre in the Rococo style (1753). Drawing on Chamber's Designs for Chinese Buildings (1757), he created the charming Chinoiserie pavilion at Drottningholm (1763-69), and designed two more theatres: Drottningholm (1764-66) and the Royal Opera in Stockholm (1777-82). In 1768-74 he built the Adolf-Fredrik Church in Stockholm, much influenced by French Classicism, and remodeled other Stockholm buildings in a Neoclassical style.



"
18,"ADEMOLLO, Luigi","(b. 1764, Milano, d. 1849, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ademollo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera in Milan, his teachers were Giuliano Traballesi, Giocondo Albertolli and Giuseppe Piermarini. In 1788 he arrived in Florence and executed, in 1789, the decorations of the Teatro della Pergola. The same year he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence."
19,"ADLER, Salomon","(b. 1630, Danzig, d. 1709, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adler/biograph.html,"
German painter. There were few Jewish secular artists in Europe prior to the Emancipation that spread throughout Europe with the Napoleonic conquests. There were few exceptions: Salomon Adler, a prominent portrait painter was one of the earliest, and most successful Jewish painters in post-medieval Europe for which there is any documentation. "
20,"ADOLPHI, Christoffel","(b. ca. 1631, Augusburg, d. 1680, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adolphi/biograph.html,"
Christoffel Adolphi (also known as Christoph Adolfzoon), Dutch medallist. Only nine medals are known by him, but only a few of these bear his signature. His best works date from 1666 to 1676 and are characteristic of Dutch medallic art of that period.



"
21,"ADRIAENSSEN, Alexander","(b. 1587, Antwerpen, d. 1661, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adriaens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was the son of the composer Emanuel Adriaenssen and brother to the painters Vincent Adriaenssen (1595-1675) and Niclaes Adriaenssen (1598-1648/9). In 1597 he was apprenticed to Artus van Laeck (d 1616) and in 1610 became a master in the painters' guild. In 1632 he took on Philips Milcx as apprentice, and in 1635 he painted the coats of arms of the 17 provinces on the triumphal arches in honour of the new governor. Adriaenssen's many signed and often dated oil paintings on wood and canvas are all still-lifes, mainly of food on tables with copper- and tinware, glass and pottery (e.g. Still-life with Fish, 1660; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). There are four paintings of vases of flowers, but vases of flowers, as well as single flowers on the table, also appear in other still-life combinations. Only two canvases are known in which he worked with figure painters: a garland of flowers around a painting of the Holy Family (private collection) by Simon de Vos and a porcelain bowl of fruit beside a Virgin and Child (private collection) attributed to a follower of Rubens.
"
22,ADRIANO FIORENTINO,"(b. ca. 1455, Firenze, d. 1499, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/adriano/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, military engineer, bronze founder, and medallist. Like his collaborator Bertoldo di Giovanni, he may have started his working life as a servant in the house of Lorenzo de' Medici. An 'Adriano nostro' is recorded delivering letters for Lorenzo in 1483 and again in March 1484, when Lorenzo referred to him as 'Adriano formerly our groom' (staffiere).  He worked at courts in Italy and also in Germany, where he produced one of his best-known works, a bronze bust of Elector Frederick III the Wise in contemporary costume (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden)."
23,"AELST, Willem van","(b. ca. 1626, Delft, d. 1683, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aelst/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter from Delft. He was a good draughtsman and vivid colourist. He specialized in still-lifes, as did his uncle and teacher Evert van Aelst of Delft (1602–57), whose name survives only in inventories and who died in poverty. Willem’s earliest known work, a Still-life with Fruit (1642; destroyed in World War II), is likely to have been influenced by his uncle’s style. On 9 November 1643 he enrolled in the Delft painters’ guild and from 1645 to 1649 was in France. From 1649 to 1656 he worked in Florence as court painter to Ferdinando II de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. There he met his fellow countrymen Matthias Withoos and Otto Marseus van Schrieck, the latter also a still-life painter, who probably influenced van Aelst’s detailed and smooth style, and with whom van Aelst returned to the Netherlands in 1656 — first briefly to Delft before settling in Amsterdam in 1657. Van Aelst’s usual signature on paintings, Guill[er]mo van Aelst, recalls his stay in Italy, as does the (occasional) use of his bent-name ‘Vogelverschrikker’ (scarecrow), which appears, for example, on a Still-life with Poultry (1658; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)."
24,"AENVANCK, Theodoor","(b. 1633, Antwerpen, d. 1690, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aenvanck/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He is believed to have been a pupil of Jan Davidsz. de Heem around 1647. His chosen genre was still-life painting. He became a member of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1647, and in 1669 he became master."
25,AERT VAN ORT,(active ca. 1490-1536),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aert/biograph.html,"
Aert van Ort (other names: Aert van Ortkens, Arnold of Nijmegen, Arnoult de Nimegue), Netherlandish glass painter. He was one of the most productive and influential stained-glass artists of the early 16th century and according to Guicciardini invented the technique of firing enamel colour into glass. He began his career in Tournai, where his most famous works are the transept windows of the cathedral (c. 1500), over-restored by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier c. 1845. Shortly after 1500 Aert van Ort was called to Rouen, where he influenced a generation of Norman glass painters. His work is exemplified in windows in Rouen Cathedral; the Crucifixion now in York Minster, England, originally from St Jean, Rouen; and windows in St Vincent or St Godard, Rouen.



"
26,"AERTSEN, Pieter","(b. 1508, Amsterdam, d. 1575, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aertsen/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, active in his native Amsterdam and in Antwerp. A pioneer of still life and genre painting, he is best known for scenes that at first glance look like pure examples of these types, but which in fact have a religious scene incorporated in them (Butcher's Stall with the Flight into Egypt, University of Uppsala, 1551). Aertsen was the head of a long dynasty of painters, of whom the most talented was his nephew and pupil Joachim Beuckelaer.


"
27,"AGABITI, Pietro Paolo","(b. ca. 1470, Sassoferato, d. ca. 1540, Cupramontana)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agabiti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and possible woodcutter. He spent his early years in Sassoferrato, where his family owned a ceramics workshop. Around 1497 he probably visited the Veneto region, since his Virgin and Child with Saints (Padua, Museo Civico) painted that year shows the strong influence of painters active there such as Cima da Conegliano. The painting also reflects the Bolognese style of Francesco Francia and that of the Romagnian Marco Palmezzano. In Venice, Agabiti may have made woodcuts after the illustrations for Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (Venice, 1499). By 1502 he had returned to the Marches, where he executed a painting (untraced) for San Rocco, Jesi, the town where in 1507 he is documented as residing. After 1510 he was again in Sassoferrato, where in 1511 he signed and dated both the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Sassoferrato,  Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna) and the Nativity in Santa Maria del Piano. In 1518, for the same church, he signed and dated an altarpiece depicting the Virgin and Child with SS Catherine and John the Baptist (in situ). In San Fortunato, Sassoferrato, he executed the Virgin and Child with Saints (1521; in situ), in which the influence of Marco Palmezzano is even more evident."
28,"AGASSE, Jacques-Laurent","(b. 1767, Geneve, d. 1849, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agasse/biograph.html,"
English painter of Swiss birth. Born into a wealthy and politically influential Huguenot family, Agasse spent his early childhood at the country estate of Crévin, where he may have developed the interest in animals and natural history that was to guide his later career as an artist in England. Agasse trained first at the Ecole du Colibri in Geneva and subsequently in Paris under Jacques-Louis David (beginning in 1787) and possibly under Horace Vernet. His early artistic output consisted chiefly of unpretentious silhouette 'cut-outs' in the style of Jean-Daniel Huber. At this time he also undertook a serious study of dissection and veterinary science."
29,AGNOLO DI VENTURA,(active 1311-1349 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agnol/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor (also Agnolo da Siena). He is first mentioned in 1311 amongst the taxpayers of the district of San Quirico in Siena. The surviving documents testify to his activity as civic and military architect for the Comune di Siena: in 1319 he was paid for a number of works at Porta Salaria, in 1333 he was consulted on the extension of the Duomo, and in 1334-35 he was in charge of the fortifications of Grosseto and Massa Marittima. He may have also executed the projects for Porta Sant'Agata and Porta Romana in Siena. There are no surviving documents referring to his life and work after 1349."
30,AGNOLO DI POLO,"(b. ca. 1470, Firenze, d. after 1498)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agnolo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He belonged to a family of well-known artisans; his grandfather Agnolo di Lippo di Polo had worked as an assistant on the stained glass for the cupola of Florence Cathedral and took the name de' Vetri, sometimes also used by his descendants. Agnolo's father, Polo di Agnolo, made masks and had his workshop on the Ponte Vecchio, Florence, and his brother Domenico de' Vetri engraved precious stones and medals. Vasari said that Agnolo was a pupil of Verrocchio, adding that 'he worked very well in clay and has filled the city with works from his hands'. Given the artist's birth date and that Verrocchio left Florence forever in 1483, Agnolo's apprenticeship would have been very brief; it is probable that he stayed on in the workshop when it was directed by Lorenzo di Credi.


"
31,AGOSTINO DI DUCCIO,"(b. 1418, Firenze, d. 1481, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agostin/biograph.html,"
Florentine sculptor and architect. He was the most original if not the greatest sculptor of his time, and the only 15th century sculptor born in Florence who owed little to Donatello or Ghiberti. His fresh and lively style was linear and graceful with distinctive swirling draperies."
32,AGOSTINO DI GIOVANNI,(active 1310-1347 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agostino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He is first documented in 1310 in Siena, when he married Lagina di Nese, who was possibly a sister of the sculptor Cellino di Nese of Pistoia. Their two sons Giovanni d'Agostino and Domenico both became sculptors and master builders, but Agostino seems to have been the most significant artist in the family."
33,"AGRATE, Gian Francesco Ferrari d'","(b. 1489, Parma, d. ca. 1563, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agrate/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, part of a Lombard family of sculptors, active in Parma. His brother Marco (died after 1571) was also sculptor. Gian Francesco worked as an assistant and follower of Bernardino Zaccagni on the construction and then the decoration of the church of Steccata (1532), furthermore on the pilasters and pillars in the church of San Giovanni Evangelista, both in Parma. In 1514 he executed the window on the façade of the Cathedral Library in Parma, and the mausoleum of Montini (1507) and Vincent Carissimi (1520) in the cathedral. Between 1528 and 1536 he made the monument to Sforzino Sforza in the Steccata."
34,"AGRESTI, Livio","(b. 1505, Forli, d. 1579, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/agresti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil of Francesco Menzocchi (1502-1574). In 1535 he painted the frescoes of the Eucharist and the Prophets for the Chapel of the Sacrament in Forli Cathedral (now in the Pinacoteca Civica di Forli). In 1539, he painted in the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi. He joined the Accademia di San Luca in Rome in 1534. In 1544, he painted the frescoes of allegorical figures in the Sala Paolina of the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, under the supervision of Perino del Vaga. Agresti also helped decorate the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome."
35,"AGUADO LÓPEZ, Antonio","(b. 1764, Sangüesa, d. 1831, Sangüesa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aguado/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. Disciple of Juan de Villanueva, he studied in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, being pensioned to continue its formation in Italy and in France. In 1795 he was appointed member of the Commission of Architecture of the Academy, as well as professor in the same one. In 1799 he was appointed Lieutenant Director of Architecture and finally in 1805 Director of Architecture."
36,"AIMO, Domenico","(b. ca. 1465, Varignana, d. 1539, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aimo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. In 1511, he is documented to produce two sculptures for the lunette of the Porta Magna of San Petronio, Bologna: an archivolt relief depicting a half-length figure of Moses, and a statue of St Ambrose."
37,"AIVAZOVSKY, Ivan Konstantinovich","(b. 1817, Feodosiya, d. 1900, Feodosiya)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aivazovs/biograph.html,"
Russian painter of Armenian descent, most famous for his seascapes, which constitute more than half of his paintings. He was born in the town of Feodosiya, Crimea, to a poor Armenian family. His parents family name was Aivazian. Some of artist's paintings bear a signature, in Armenian letters, ""Hovhannes Aivazian""."
38,"AKEN, Joseph van","(b. ca. 1699, Antwerpen, d. 1749, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aken/biograph.html,"

Joseph van Aken (also Vanaken or Haeken), Flemish painter, active in England. In Antwerp he began painting genre scenes in the Flemish tradition. He arrived in London with his family c. 1720 and continued to produce genre paintings as well as conversation pieces. His paintings reveal his Flemish training, although the figures are wooden and stilted and the work devoid of moralizing intent. They also show his adaptation of this genre tradition to contemporary London scenes, and the several versions of these works attest to their popularity."
39,"AKOTANTOS, Angelos",(died before 1457),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/akotanto/biograph.html,"
Greek painter of post-Byzantine icons, active in the island of Crete. He probably came from Constantinople and was the founder of the Cretan school of icon painting which flourished from the second half of the 15th century until the 17th century.



"
40,"ALBA, Macrino d'","(b. ca. 1460, Alba, d. ca. 1528, Alba)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alba/biograph.html,"
Macrino d'Alba (Gian Giacomo de Alladio), Italian painter. Inscriptions on his altarpieces indicate he was born in Alba. He probably trained elsewhere; his early works, with the exception of the portrait of Andrea Novelli, Bishop of Alba (Isola Bella, Museo Borromeo), cannot be traced to a precise location. His patrons were mainly from the Paleologo court at Casale Monferrato, where he was the official painter. His earliest signed and dated work is the triptych of the Virgin Enthroned between SS John the Evangelist, James the Greater, John the Baptist and Thomas Aquinas and Two Donors (1495; Turin, Museo Civico d'Arte Antica), and it and the Virgin and Child between SS Nicholas and Martin (Rome, Pinacoteca Capitolina) show the influence of Lombard painters, particularly Ambrogio Bergognone; some writers have suggested that this may indicate a journey through central Italy, perhaps to Rome."
41,"ALBANI, Francesco","(b. 1578, Bologna, d. 1660, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/albani/biograph.html,"
Albani studied in Bologna with the Mannerist Denijs Calvaert before joining the Carracci Academy where he was an enthusiastic pupil. Like so many other artists from Bologna, he moved to Rome to study classical art which he then applied with zeal to his own work. Albani's classicism can be seen in the altarpieces he painted after returning to Bologna. Among them is The Baptism of Christ now in the Bologna Pinacoteca Nazionale."
42,"ALBEREGNO, Jacobello",(died before1397 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alberegn/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Only one known document, dated July 1397, mentions Alberegno, referring to him as deceased, and we have a single signed work, the tempera on panel triptych with gold background depicting the Crucifixion in the middle and St Gregory and St Jerome in the side panels (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). Although he was faithful to the Byzantine culture made popular by Paolo Veneziano, Alberegno introduced to Venice, through Giusto de' Menabuoi, the new contribution of Giotto (Polyptych of the Apocalypse, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice).

43,"ALBERTI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1390, Ferrara, d. ca. 1442, Urbino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/albert/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Ferrara, Bologna, and Urbino. He married a woman from Urbino in 1423, and settled there permanently in 1424."
44,"ALBERTI, Leon Battista","(b. 1404, Genova, d. 1472, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alberti/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, humanist, antiquarian, mathematician, art theorist, ""universal man"" of the Early Renaissance. He is principally famous as an architect, but is also known to have practised as a painter and sculptor. The only work attributable to him in these arts is the plaque, said to be a self-portrait, in Washington. His importance in the arts of painting and sculpture is on account of his theoretical writings, De Sculptura and especially Della Pittura (1435), which gives the first exposition in the Renaissance of the theory of perspective as well as of History Painting. His influential treatise Della Pittura (On Painting) was the first modern manual for painters. It was circulated in manuscript until 1540, when it was first printed.

45,"ALBERTI, Cherubino","(b. 1553, Borgo San Sepolcro, d. 1615, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alberti1/cherubin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker, part of a family of artists, brother of Alessandro and Giovanni Alberti. The best known of the three sons of Alberto Alberti, he distinguished himself as a printmaker at an early age. One of his earliest prints, an etching of the Virgin and Child (1568) shows his interest in Raphael as well as in contemporary Mannerist art. In Rome he studied with Cornelis Cort, whose swelling burin line he adopted to create pictorial effects of strong chiaroscuro."
46,"ALBERTI, Giovanni","(b. 1558, Borgo San Sepolcro, d. 1601, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alberti1/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Cherubino and Alessandro Alberti. He distinguished himself as an expert in perspective design, for which he was praised by Ignazio Danti (1536-1586), Federico Zuccaro and Giovanni Baglione. He is thus usually credited with the design of the architectural perspectives in the fresco decorations he painted in collaboration with his brothers. He also painted putti and ornamental figures. He assisted Danti in the Sala dei Palafrenieri and Sala Vecchia degli Svizzeri in the Vatican (after February 1582) and was influenced by Danti's belief that perspective decorations should be oriented for the most typical viewing point of the spectator."
47,"ALBERTINELLI, Mariotto","(b. 1474, Firenze, d. 1515, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/albertin/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter, trained by Cosimo Rosselli, in whose studio he met Fra Bartolomeo. The two went into partnership in 1508, but soon after this Albertinelli temporarily abandoned painting to become an innkeeper, saying (according to Vasari) that he was fed up with criticism and wanted a 'less difficult and more cheerful craft'. Vasari also says he was a 'restless man, a follower of Venus, and a good liver.' His paintings are elegant but rather insipid. His best work is the Visitation (1503) in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.



"
48,"ALBERTOLLI, Giocondo","(b. 1743, Bedano, d. 1839, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/albertol/biograph.html,"
Swiss-born Italian architect, sculptor and designer. He is noted for his influential Neoclassical ornamental designs and for work as an interior decorator in Milan (Palazzo Reale) and Florence (Palazzo Pitti). He trained in Parma where he also met Ennemond Alexandre Petitot. He became a professor at the Milan Accademia di Belle Arti in 1775 and he directed the school of ornament there until 1812.



"
49,"ALBOTTO, Francesco","(b. 1721, Venezia, d. 1757, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/albotto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Until quite recently, little was known of the life of this 18th-century Venetian painter who only lived for 37 years. He was a young assistant to Marieschi at the time of Marieschi's death in 1741. He was also a view painter and he married the widow of Marieschi and called himself the ""second"" Marieschi. He continued to produce pictures for the busy Venetian market, usually of decidedly good quality but rather reminiscent of Marieschi. His pictures are quite rare.  His imitations of the master's work have created a good deal of confusion between the two artists. Ultimately, however, Albotto's style began to ossify and he started to repeat himself, making it less difficult to separate his work from that of Marieschi."
50,"ALCIBAR, José de","(b. 1725/30, Mexico, d. 1803, Mexico)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alcibar/biograph.html,"
Mexican painter, the last of the painters belonging to the old Mexican school. Very little is known about his life. He was a member of the Mexican academy of art which existed in Mexico City from 1753. The academy probably consisted mostly of Christian subject painters and possibly sculptors. Alcibar executed many works of merit, especially two large paintings in the cathedral of Mexico, dated 1779.

Italian architect. He studied at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. In his youth, he completed a number of restorations and buildings in his native town, including a restoration of the Porta di San Lorenzo (1820), the Teatro Feronia (1823), and the church of San Paolo (1828), the church of San Michele (1830), and the Torre dell'Orologio in the Piazza del Popolo (1832). His masterpiece is the Sferisterio di Macerata (completed in 1829)."
53,"ALEKSANDROVIÆ, Ljubomir","(b. 1828, Srpski Sv. Marton, d. 1887)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aleksand/biograph.html,"
Serbian painter of Romanticism. He learned painting in Temesvár with Nikola Aleksić (1808-1873), and later continued to study in Konstantin Danil's (1802-1873) workshop. Most probably he graduated in Vienna's Academy of Art. He worked in Temesvár, usually for church, but he also painted some portraits.

Russian painter. He was the son of the caretaker at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he was admitted in 1764. In 1767, he took a class in ornamental sculpture and later studied scenic painting with Antonio Peresinotti (1708-1778). From 1773 to 1777, he lived in Venice on a fellowship, where he studied to be a theatre artist. This did not appeal to him, however, and he spent much of his time painting landscapes and copying the old masters."
55,"ALENZA Y NIETO, Leonardo","(b. 1807, Madrid, d. 1845, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alenza/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and illustrator. He studied at the Real Academia de S Fernando, Madrid, under Juan Antonio Ribera y Fernández and José de Madrazo y Agudo. He worked independently of court circles and achieved some fame but nevertheless died in such poverty that his burial was paid for by friends. He is often described as the last of the followers of Goya, in whose Caprichos and drawings he found inspiration for the genre scenes for which he became best known. Of these scenes of everyday life and customs the more interesting include The Beating (Madrid, Casón Buen Retiro) and Galician with Puppets (c. 1835; Madrid, Casón Buen Retiro)."
56,"ALESSI, Galeazzo","(b. 1512, Perugia, d. 1572, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alessi/biograph.html,"

Italian painter. He was one of the thee painter sons of Benozzo Gozzoli. The three sons, Francesco, Gerolamo and Alesso, worked together in Pistoia to execute various commissions including a Maestà for the Palazzo Comunale (left unfinished).

"
58,ALEVIZ NOVY,(active 1499-1531 in Russia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aleviz/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He is known also as Aloisio Nuovo, and perhaps can be identified as the sculptor/architect Alvise da Montagnana. He was invited by Ivan III to work in Moscow. He was apprehended by the khan of Crimea, and at his court he built some sections of the famous palace in Bakhchisaray."
59,"ALGARDI, Alessandro","(b. 1598, Bologna, d. 1654, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/algardi/biograph.html,"Italian sculptor, the son of a silk merchant from Bologna. He was trained under Lodovico Carracci at the Accademia degli Incamminati, where he acquired the skills of a first-rate draftsman. After a short period of activity in Mantua (1622), he moved to Rome (1625), where he designed the stucco decorations in San Silvestro al Quirinale and gained some success as a restorer of classical sculptures. With the monument of Cardinal Mellini (d. 1629) in Santa Maria del Popolo, the Frangipani monument in San Marcello al Corso, and the bust of Cardinal Laudivio Zacchia, Algardi emerged as the principal rival of Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the field of portrait sculpture. Lacking Bernini's dynamic vitality and penetrating characterization, Algardi's portraits were appreciated for their sobriety and surface realism."

Sculptor, part of a French family of artists. Etienne Allegrain (1644-1736) was a landscape painter who worked predominantly in the tradition of classical scenes established in the mid-17th century by Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. His brother Jean-Baptiste Allegrain (1644-before 1714) was a sculptor, while his son Gabriel Allegrain (1679-1748) was also a landscape painter, whose works can be distinguished from those of his father only with difficulty. Gabriel's son Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain was a sculptor who was much influenced by his more illustrious contemporary and brother-in-law Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. Christophe-Gabriel's own son Gabriel Allegrain II (1733-after 1779) was a sculptor who worked in the naval dockyard at Rochefort."

Italian architect and engineer, part of a family artists architects, son of the master mason Martino Allio I. There are four branches of this family of artists. The family was originally from Scaria but in the 16th and 17th centuries many family members moved to Austria, Bavaria, Bohemia, and Hungary, where they worked in a variety of fields associated with building. There were many intermarriages in the Allio family and thus the family tree is complex."
65,"ALLORI, Alessandro","(b. 1535, Firenze, d. 1607, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/allori/alessand/biograph.html,"
Alessandro Allori (1535-1607), Florentine painter, the pupil and adopted son of Bronzino. An early visit to Rome added the influence of late Michelangelo paintings to that of his master's courtly Mannerism. The Pearl Fishers (Studiolo of Francesco I, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, c.1570) is generally considered his masterpiece; playful and full of artifice, it combines nude figures obviously drawn from Michelangelo with Bronzino's svelteness and enamelled colouring. He was one of the last notable exponents of Mannerism, painting in a style that had become outmoded by the time of his death.

American painter and writer, considered the most important artistic personality of the first generation of Romanticism in the USA. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who met him in Rome and whose portrait Allston painted (National Portrait Gallery, London), considered him 'a man of... high and rare genius ... whether I contemplate him in the character of a Poet, a Painter, or a Philosophic Analyst'."

English painter and designer of Dutch birth. The son of a notary, Alma-Tadema demonstrated an early artistic ability. In 1852 he entered the Antwerp Academy, where he studied under Gustaf Wappers (1803-1874), and Nicaise de Keyser (1813-1887). An important influence at this time was Louis de Taye, Professor of Archaeology at the academy and a practicing artist. Alma-Tadema lived and worked with De Taye from 1857 to 1859 and was encouraged by him to depict subjects from the early history of France and Belgium. This taste for historical themes increased when Alma-Tadema entered Baron Henri Leys's studio in 1859 and began assisting him with his monumental frescoes for the Antwerp Town Hall."

Spanish sculptor also known as El Maestro Sebastián (Sebastián de Toledo). He was born in Torrijos, although his name suggests that he was a native of Almonacid. He is one of the artists belonging to the group of Torrijos, formed in the workshop of Egas Cueman, including Antón Egas, Enrique Egas, Juan Guas and Alonso de Covarrubias, all related in Torrijos in one way or another. He was active mainly in Castile, in Guadalajara, Segovia and Toledo where he often worked alongside Juan Guas."
70,ALOISIO DA CARCANO,(active 1493-1516 in Russia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aloisio/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, also known by several other names such as Aloisio da Caresana, Aloisio da Milano, Aleviz Milanets and Aleviz Fryazin. He was active in Russia. He came to Moscow in 1494 at the invitation of Ivan III to replace Pietro Antonio Solari as a senior court architect responsible for fortifications and palaces.

71,"ALSLOOT, Denis van","(b. 1570, Bruxelles, d. 1626, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/alsloot/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The earliest document referring to him is a receipt dated 26 May 1593 for the gilding and decoration of the Garnier family monument in Notre-Dame-du-Sablon in Brussels. The records of the Brussels painters' guild, which survive only from 1599 onwards, do not mention his admission as a master but show that he took on four apprentices between 1599 and 1625, the last being Pieter van der Borcht. In 1599–1600 he entered the service of Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella, who entrusted him with many important commissions. In 1603 and 1604 van Alsloot received two payments from them for the design and weaving of two-and-a-half laps of tapestry with grotesques. This has often been taken, erroneously, to indicate that he held a prominent place in the development of Brussels tapestry manufacturing."

Italian painter. He probably came from Zevio near Verona and is 
sometimes considered to be the founder of the Veronese School, although the only surviving 
example of his work in that town is a fresco in Sta Anastasia. Most of his surviving work is in 
Padua, where he had a hand in fresco cycles in the Basilica of St Anthony (between 1372 and 
1379) and in the Oratory of St George (between 1377 and 1384), in the latter of which he 
collaborated with an artist called Avanzo, who is otherwise unknown and whose contribution to 
the work is uncertain.

By the end of May 1553, Cristofano had sent 24 finished portraits to Florence, followed by 26 more by September 1554 and another 25 by October 1556. The following month Cristofano received 100 scudi from Cosimo. By 1591 the works had been transferred to the corridors of the Uffizi, where they form part of the museum's large collection of portraits. During his stay in Como, Cristofano travelled to Milan to execute two portraits of the Duchess Ippolita Gonzaga in competition with Bernardino Campi, who was declared the winner.

77,"ALTOBELLO, Francesco Antonio","(b. 1637, Barletta, d. after 1695)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/altobell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He received his first artistic training in the workshop of Carlo Rosa in Apulia, although his earliest known works, the Holy Family (1675; Barletta, Santa Maria della Vittoria) and a painting of the same subject attributed to him (Barletta, Palazzo Monte di Pietà), reveal the influence of Cesare Fracanzano (c. 1605-1651) and Francesco Cozza (1605-1682)."

Austrian painter, son of Martino Altomonte. He was first taught by his father and from 1717 studied in Bologna with Marco Antonio Franceschini, then in Rome with Benedetto Luti and finally in Naples with Francesco Solimena. The sketchbook dated 1718 (Vienna, Albertina) contains only copies after Italian drawings from Luti's collection (now mostly Windsor Castle, Royal Library). Other surviving early studies (Melk, Stiftsmuseum, and Markt St Florian, Stiftssammlung) have a nervous energy that shows the influence of Ricci (also represented in the Luti collection)."

Martino Altomonte (Johann Martin Hohenberg), Austrian painer, part of a family of artists. He was apprenticed at the age of 15 to Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Rome, where he next studied with Carlo Maratti. In 1684 he was offered an appointment at the court of King John III of Poland and altered his name to Martino Altomonte. He travelled to Warsaw, where he produced paintings of royal battles and portraits (untraced) for the royal castle of Zólkiew (now Nesterov) near Lwow (now Lviv, Ukraine). It appears that he also painted a fair number of altarpieces. Of these, only the Sacrifice of Abraham (now Tarnów, Diocese Museum) survives, a work that reveals Altomonte as a follower of Neapolitan chiaroscuro painting."

Portuguese architect. He graduated in philosophy and theology at the universities of Coimbra and Évora. After the death of his uncle Afonso Álvares in 1580 (active from 1550) he was chosen to replace him in the position of main architect in the region of Alentejo, where he worked on the stately homes of Santarém, Almeirim and Salvaterra de Magos and the Monastery of Batalha. In 1579 he worked in the Jesuit convent St. Anthony in Lisbon, followed in 1598 the project for the Monastery of Sao Bento da Saúde, which currently houses the Assembly of the Republic.

Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (also Omodeo), Italian architect and sculptor. He was principally active in Bergamo, Cremona, Milan and Pavia. His professional success, in terms of the architectural and sculptural commissions and official appointments that he received, was far greater than that of any of his contemporaries in Lombardy in the late 15th century, including Bramante. Amadeo's influence in both fields, for example in his use of all'antica ornament of local origin, was considerable."

Italian painter and illuminator. He was a Camaldolese monk, he took his vows at the monastery of San Benedetto a Porta Pinti in Florence in 1447, and was ordained in 1453. He was trained as a miniaturist in the circle of Fra Angelico, whose influence extended into the precincts of the celebrated scriptorium of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence. While still young he transferred to the Badia at Sansepolcro, where he met Piero della Francesca, under whose direction he completed the predella and pilasters of the Madonna della Misericordia (Museo Comunale, Sansepolcro); the polyptych was left unfinished after Piero departed for Rome in 1459 to fresco the apartments of Pope Pius II. Through Piero, Fra Giuliano found employment in the Roman Curia, becoming one of the city's most prolific and influential miniaturists in the Rome of Pius II, the great humanist pope. He had less talent for monumental painting"
85,"AMENDOLA, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1848, Episcopio di Sarno, d. 1887, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amendola/biograph.html,"

Much of his work is to be seen in Naples, including a statue of Joachim Murat for the façade of the Royal Palace, a bust of architect Enrico Alvino in the grounds of the Villa Comunale. In Salerno his Pergolesi Dying can be seen at the opera house. He also sculpted the caryatids at the entrance of the Mausoleo Schilizzi in Posillipo."
86,"AMERLING, Friedrich von","(b. 1803, Wien, d. 1887, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amerling/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He came from a family of craftsmen and studied (1815-24) at the Akademie der bildenden Künste, Vienna, where one of his teachers was the conservative history painter Hubert Maurer (1738-1818). From 1824 to 1826 he attended the Academy in Prague, where he was taught by Josef Bergler. In 1827 and 1828 Amerling stayed in London, and he met the portrait painter Sir Thomas Lawrence, whose work was to be a strong influence on Amerling's painting during the next two decades. Amerling also travelled to Paris and Rome but was recalled to Vienna on an official commission to paint a life-size portrait of the emperor Francis I of Austria (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum). With this work, Amerling became the most sought-after portrait painter in Vienna, a position he was to retain for about 15 years. In addition, he was also a major painter of historic and genre pictures, and landscapes. He worked mostly for the arictocracy. He was the master of the Hungarian painter József Borsos.

87,AMICO FRIULANO DEL DOSSO,(active 1510-1540 in northern Italy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amico/biograph.html,"
Anonymous Italian painter to whom a homogenous group of works are given. His name was conceived by Roberto Longhi in 1955. As the name suggests, the artist's many idiosyncrasies find echoes in the work of the Ferrarese Dosso Dossi, but his style also incorporates elements found both in Friuli, in the north-east of Italy, and in the Veneto, but also betrays an awareness of Tuscan painting.

88,"AMIGONI, Jacopo","(b. 1682, Napoli, d. 1752, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amigoni/biograph.html,"Jacopo Amigoni (Amiconi) was a Venetian history and portrait painter who worked all over Europe in a more or less international style, the Venetian Rococo, with elements compounded from Sebastiano Ricci and French Rococo, and, later, Tiepolo. He worked for some years for the Elector of Bavaria and then came to London in 1730, where he painted several decorative cycles (e.g. Rickmansworth, near London, Moor Park Golf Club) and portraits; though these, according to Vertue, were 'not his inclination - nor Talent'. In 1739 he returned to Venice with a small fortune, and it was he who persuaded Canaletto to visit London (1746). In 1747 he went to Madrid as Court painter: Vertue records that news of his death there reached London just as his finest works - in St James's Square - were destroyed. The altarpiece of Emmanuel Collection, Cambridge, is his; other works are in Darmstadt, London, Madrid, Venice and York.

89,"AMMAN, Jost","(b. 1539, Zürich, d. 1591, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amman/biograph.html,"
Swiss draughtsman, woodcutter, engraver, etcher and painter. He was the youngest son of the noted scholar and Chorherr in Zurich, Johann Jakob Amman, a friend of Ulrich Zwingli and Konrad Gessner. Although a successful pupil at the renowned Collegium Carolinum where his father was a professor, Jost, like his brother Josua (1531-64), who became a goldsmith, did not take up a scholarly career. As early as 1556-57 his copies of prints by other artists, for example Dürer and Virgil Solis, show an independent and original approach. For his apprenticeship Amman may have been in Basle or Zurich, but he probably spent some time in Paris or Lyon, since his early works show a close similarity to French book illustrations."
90,"AMMANATI, Bartolomeo","(b. 1511, Settignano, d. 1592, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ammanati/biograph.html,"

Italian Mannerist sculptor and architect, strongly influenced by Michelangelo and by Sansovino. Orphaned at the age of 12, Ammanati earnt his living in the 'Academy' of Baccio Bandinelli c. 1523–27, after which time he left Florence for Venice. Jacopo Sansovino had just arrived there after the Sack of Rome (1527), and Ammanati was probably involved on some of Sansovino's early commissions. He left Venice after about five years, worked in Pisa, then returned to Florence where he carved a statue of Leda."
91,"AMSTEL, Jan van","(b. ca. 1500, Amsterdam, d. ca. 1542, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/amstel/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. He is possibly identified with the Master of the Brunswick Monogram (or The Brunswick Monogrammist) who is named after a painting at the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Braunschweig of The Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14). He painted religious scenes but also several scenes of secular merriment, including brothel and tavern scenes. This artist has been called a significant precursor of Pieter Bruegel the Elder."
92,"ANCHER, Anna Kirstine","(b. 1859, Skagen, d. 1935, Skagen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ancher/anna/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, part of a family painters. Michael Peter Ancher and his wife Anna Ancher, who were married in 1880, were at the centre of the artists' colony that emerged at Skagen in Jutland during the 1870s and 1880s. Their daughter Helga Ancher (1881-1964) was also active as a painter. In 1967 the family home in Skagen was opened as a museum."
93,"ANCHER, Michael Peter","(b. 1849, Rutsker, d. 1927, Skagen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ancher/michael/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, part of a family of painters, husband of Anna Kirstine Ancher. He studied at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster, Copenhagen (1871-75), where his teachers Wilhelm Marstrand and Frederik Vermehren encouraged his interest in genre painting. One of his student companions was Karl Madsen (1855-1938) who invited him to travel to Skagen, a small fishing village in the far north of Jutland where the Baltic and North Sea converge. From the mid-1870s, he and Madsen became key members of a group of artists who congregated there each summer, known as the Skagen Painters."
94,"ANCONA, Vito d'","(b. 1825, Pesaro, d. 1884, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ancona/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of the Macchiaioli group. He was born in Pesaro to a wealthy Jewish family. He began his artistic training in Florence, and in 1844 was admitted to the Accademia di Belle Arti, where he studied under Giuseppe Bezzuoli. He was a friend of Serafino De Tivoli, and joined him in painting landscapes en plein air. In 1848 he fought as a Tuscan volunteer for Garibaldi in the Risorgimento. During the 1850s he became acquainted with the artists who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence, who would soon be known as the Macchiaioli."
95,"ANDERSON, William","(b. 1757, Scotland, d. 1837, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anderson/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He was born in Scotland in 1757, though the precise details of date and place are elusive. He trained initially as a shipwright, but by the age of thirty was an accomplished and skilled marine painter and had settled in London. He seems to have applied himself to the study of the Dutch Old Masters of the Van de Velde school, since he produced numerous small works on panel which are strongly evocative of that style."
96,ANDREA DI BARTOLO,"(b. 1360/70, Siena, d. 1428, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/bartolo/biograph.html,"
Sienese painter, son of Bartolo di Fredi. He worked on many important commissions with his father (e.g. the Coronation of the Virgin polyptych, Montalcino). Later he secured a number of commissions independently of his father (e.g. St Catherine of Siena, Murano), and passed on his skills to his sons, Giovanni and Ansano. He was influenced by the great Sienese masters of the 14th century, such as Duccio and Simone Martini. He worked with Luca di Tommè."
97,ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO,"(b. 1423, Castagno, d. 1457, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/castagno/biograph.html,"
Andrea del Castagno (originally Andrea di Bartolodi Bargilla), one of the most influential 15th-century Italian Renaissance painters, best known for the emotional power and naturalistic treatment of figures in his work."
98,ANDREA DA FIRENZE,"(active 1343-1377, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/firenze/biograph.html,"
Andrea da Firenze (Andrea Bonaiuti), Florentine painter. From January 1346 he was registered in the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Florence. The earliest paintings that can be attributed to him suggest that he must have formed a close association with the workshop of Andrea di Cione. The small portable triptych of the Virgin and Child with Saints and Angels (centre panel, Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst; side panels of the Nativity and the Crucifixion, Houston,Museum of Fine Arts) shows the influence of Maso di Banco and of the painter of the Strozzi Chapel frescoes in the Chiostrino dei Morti, Santa Maria Novella, Florence."
99,ANDREA DA MURANO,"(known 1463, Venezia, d. 1512, Castelfranco Veneto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/murano/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, first documented in Venice in 1463. He began as a collaborator of Bartolomeo Vivarini. His works reveal his careful study of Giovanni Bellini and Andrea Mantegna. His most significant works include the Dead Christ Mourned in the cathedral of Cittadella, Virgin and Child in the Collezione Cini, Venice, and the Triptych now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia (1477-78). They disclose an artist  who was familiar with the work of Luca Signorelli.


"
100,ANDREA DI NERIO,"(active 1350s, Arezzo, d. before 1387)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/nerio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Long known only through meagre documents, this founder of the 14th-century Aretine school of painting was identified through the discovery of his signature on an Annunciation panel (Museo Diocesano, Arezzo) probably painted for the Compagnia di Santissima Annunziata, Arezzo, in the 1350s. His authorship can now be established for a group of stylistically similar works formerly attributed to several hands, including the Master of the Vescovado and Spinello Aretino, who was doubtless Andrea's pupil (and whose sculptor brother, Niccolò, married Andrea's daughter, Rebecca)."
101,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"(b. 1486, Firenze, d. 1530, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/sarto/biograph.html,"Italian painter, nicknamed Andrea ""of the tailor"" after his father's occupation. His real name was Andrea d'Agnolo di Francesco. He is, alongside Fra Bartolommeo, the supreme exponent of Florentine early High Renaissance style and the counterpart of Michelangelo and Raphael, active in Rome. He was the best painter (as opposed to draughtsman) in 16th-century Florence, and had more feeling for tone and colour than any of his contemporaries south of Venice. He was the first Florentine to depart from the coloured-drawing approach in favour of composition by coloured patches of light and shade, although his actual draughtsmanship is derived from Michelangelo. He also borrowed from the newly-arrived prints by Dürer. Except for a visit to Rome around 1511, where his style gained greater monumentality, and a year-long stay in France in 1518, where he completed a few works at the invitation of François I, he spent most of his life in Florence.

"
102,ANDREA di Vanni d'Andrea,"(b. ca. 1332, Siena, d. 1414, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andrea/vanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. He was one of the foremost members of the political faction that ruled Siena from 1368 to 1385, he was elected to the Grand Council and sent as Sienese ambassador to the pope at Avignon and Naples. His career of painting fresco cycles and altarpieces for the city's cathedral and churches is also well documented. His art, however, was less noteworthy, his style remained true to the ever popular though increasingly unimaginatively interpreted idioms he had assimilated as a young man from Simone Martini's artistic heirs. His small-scale early works of the Virgin and Child (Oxford, Ashmolean; Berlin, Gemäldegalerie), which draw on the figure types of the Master of the Palazzo Venezia Madonna (fl c. 1350), display soft contours, fairly light skin tones and light brushwork. The Child in particular possesses a degree of appealing spontaneity and a sense of arrested movement that is totally lacking in the later series of large panels, such as those to be found in the churches of S Donato, S Francesco and S Stefano, all in Siena."
103,"ANDREANI, Andrea","(b. ca. 1558, Mantova, d. ca. 1629, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andreani/biograph.html,"
Italian woodcutter and printmaker. He is known especially for his chiaroscuro printing, a technique developed in the early 16th century to facilitate shading. In this technique, several woodblocks are used for the same print, each block engraved to produce a different tone of the same colour."
104,"ANDREESCU, Ion","(b. 1850, Bucureºti, d. 1882, Bucureºti)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andreesc/biograph.html,"
Romanian painter. He was born in Bucharest into a merchant's family. Andreescu studied at the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest with Theodor Aman (1831-1891) from 1869 to 1872. By 1872 he was an instructor of drawing and calligraphy at the Bishop's School in Buzãu. He continued his studies at the Académie Julian in Paris from 1879 to 1881."
105,"ANDREOLI, Giorgio","(b. ca. 1465, Intra, d. 1553, Gubbio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andreoli/biograph.html,"
Italian potter. Born near Lake Maggiore in the late 1470s, Giorgio di Pietro Andreoli moved to Gubbio in central Italy around 1490, where he founded and directed his own maiolica workshop. Because of his great skill in the difficult luster technique, Andreoli was frequently hired to embellish the wares of other workshops, an unusual practice. After adorning these works of other masters, he often signed the pieces himself. So famous did he become that the Duke of Urbino granted him citizenship and exempted him from paying taxes and duties.

106,"ANDRIESSEN, Hendrick","(b. 1607, Antwerpen, d. 1655, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andries/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He joined the guild in Antwerp in 1637 as a pupil. He is known mainly as a still-life painter, and his still-life paintings mostly fall into the category of Vanitas."
107,"ANDRIESSEN, Jurriaan","(b. 1742, Amsterdam, d. 1819, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/andriess/biograph.html,"
Dutch family of painters and draughtsmen. Although they came from a non-artistic background, the brothers Jurriaan Andriessen and Anthonie Andriessen (1747-1813) became successful painters, specializing in supplying painted wallpapers, which they made at their factory in Amsterdam. Jurriaan also produced work for the theatre. Both brothers were active in the Amsterdam Tekenacademie; their pupils included some of the best-known 19th-century Dutch artists, such as Wouter Johannes van Troostwijk, Hendrik Voogd and Jean Grandjean, as well as Jurriaan's son Christiaan Andriessen and granddaughter Cornelia Aletta van Hulst."

French architect and engraver, founder of a dynasty of architects and decorators which lasted almost till the mid eighteenth century. The nickname ""Cerceau"" comes from the emblem of a ring that appears in lieu of a signature on engravings by Jacques Androuet."
109,"ANDROUET DU CERCEAU, Jean","(b. ca. 1585, Paris, d. 1649, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/androuet/jean/biograph.html,"
French architect and engineer, part of a family of architects, grandchild of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau the Elder, son of Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau (c. 1545-1590)."
110,"ANESI, Paolo","(b. 1697, Roma, d. 1773, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anesi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and engraver. He was the son of Pietro Anesi, a silk weaver from Venice. Paolo studied figure painting with Giuseppe Chiari and, in 1715, landscape painting with Bernardino Fergioni (1674-?1738), who was also teaching Andrea Locatelli at that time. Sebastiano Conca was another of Anesi's teachers. In 1723 Anesi married the daughter of the architect Giuseppe Sardi. His earliest known work is a drawing (1719; Florence, Uffizi), but he made his reputation with the only known example of his engraved work: Varie vedute inventate ed intagliate, dedicated to Cardinal Giuseppe Renato Imperiali and published in Rome in 1725."
111,"ANGEL, Pedro",(active 1583-1617 in Toledo),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angel/biograph.html,"
Spanish engraver and etcher. Although he lived in Oropesa until 1598, completing woodcuts for Alonso Villegas's Flos sanctorum ... (Madrid, 1588), Angel had already established contacts in Toledo. There he joined the Cofradía del Santísimo Sacramento in 1590 and finally settled in the city in 1598. In Toledo he gained a reputation among the humanist circles; in addition to Villegas, such writers as Juan de Narbona and Jerónimo Ceballos commissioned engraved portraits to accompany their books. The accomplished strength and presence he achieved is evident in such works as the oval portrait of Cardinal Tavera, which appeared in Pedro Salazar de Mendoza's Chronica del Cardenal Juan de Tavera (Toledo, 1603). Angel's last known engraving is dated 1617.



"
112,"ANGELI, Giuseppe","(b. 1712, Venezia, d. 1798, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angeli/biograph.html,"
Late Baroque Italian painter, active mainly in Venice. He entered Piazzetta's workshop at an early age. Among the painters of the workshop he was the most adept at imitating the master's style, and later he became the director of the workshop. In his early period he produced genre paintings, half-length devotional images, decorative cycles, and large religious paintings, however, in his maturity he concentrated on religious paintings. His style derived primarily from his teacher's late manner, although he was receptive to other contemporary developments, particularly the refined elegance and lighter palettes of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Jacopo Amigoni. "
113,"ANGELICO, Fra","(b. ca. 1400, Vicchio nell Mugello, d. 1455, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angelico/biograph.html,"Florentine painter, a Dominican friar, originally named Guido di Pietro. Although in popular tradition he has been seen as 'not an artist properly so-called but an inspired saint', (Ruskin), Angelico was in fact a highly professional artist, who was in touch with the most advanced developments in contemporary Florentine art and in later life travelled extensively for prestigious commissions.

"
114,"ANGELLINI, Francesco Maria",(1680-1731),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angellin/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Bologna. Francesco Maria Angellini (or Angelini) was the architect of scenic staircases in the Palazzo Aldrovandi-Montanari and Casa Zucchini. Biographical data are not available.



"
115,"ANGELLIS, Pieter","(b. 1685, Dunkerque, d. 1734, Rennes)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angellis/biograph.html,"
Pieter Angellis (also spelt Pierre Angillis), Flemish painter. After studying art in his native town, he visited Flanders and Germany, and spent some time at Antwerp, where he was made a master of the Guild of St. Luke, in 1715-16; and at Düsseldorf, where he had the opportunity of educating himself by studying the paintings in the Electoral Gallery. He painted conversation-pieces, and landscapes with small figures, into which he often introduced fruit and fish."
116,ANGELO DI NALDUCCIO,(active 1342-1389 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angelo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and carver, one of the minor masters in Siena in the second half of the fourteenth century. He is documented for buying a house in Siena in 1349, and he was registered in the Painters' Guild in 1356.



"
117,ANGELO DA ORVIETO,(active 1317-1352),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angelo_o/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. Angelo da Orvieto seems to have been trained by Lorenzo Maitani, who had been appointed as the capomaestro of the Duomo of Orvieto in 1310. He might have been the ""Angelo"" documented with Maitani in Perugia in 1317. His first securely attributed work was the Palazzo dei Priori (or Palazzo Comunale), Città di Castello: an early transcription of the now-illegible date gives it as 1322. Two other inscriptions record that he was associated with the portal of Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio in 1332-37. No works in his native Orvieto are attributed to him.



"
118,ANGELO DA SIENA,"(documented 1447, Ferrara, d. 1456, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angelo_s/biograph.html,"
Angelo di Pietro del Macagnino da Siena, Italian painter, son of Pietro da Siena. He was court painter to Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and, with Cosmè Tura, decorated the Duke's studiolo at the Villa Belfiore (destroyed) from 1447. The iconographic programme was provided by Guarino da Verona. In 1449 Cyriac of Ancona saw two finished paintings of Clio and Melpomene (both untraced) in Angelo's workshop, probably destined for the studiolo. It appears that while in Ferrara, Angelo learned the technique of painting in oils from Rogier van der Weyden, who had been invited to the city in 1449 to paint a triptych with the Deposition, Adam and Eve, and Supplicant Regulus."
119,ANGELUCCIO,"(b. ca. 1620, Roma, d. ca. 1650, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angelucc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is the only known pupil of Claude Lorrain other than Claude's long-standing assistant Giandomenico Desiderii (c. 1622-after 1657). Pascoli, the only biographer to record him, claimed in his life of Claude that Angeluccio was Claude's most able student but had died young and was able to work little. Angeluccio appears to have lived in Rome and, like Claude, was exclusively a landscape painter. About 25 paintings and 35 drawings, all dated 1640-45, comprise his entire oeuvre. Claude's influence can be seen in such paintings as Landscape with Figures and Bridge (private collection). This is a composition with centrally placed foreground figures framed by trees in the middle ground, which in turn stand before a bridge and a distant vista, and was borrowed directly from such paintings by Claude as Pastoral Landscape (1644-45; Barnes Foundation, Merion)."
120,"ANGERMAYER, Johann Adalbert","(b. 1674, Bilina, d. 1740, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angermay/biograph.html,"
Johann Adalbert Angermeyer was a German/Bohemian painter. From 1699 he was a pupil of Johann Rudolf Byss (1660-1738), and later he became the first Prague still-life specialist. Occasionally, he worked with the Prague historical painter Peter Brandl.



"
121,"ANGOLO DEL MORO, Giulio","(b. 1555, Verona, d. 1616, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angolo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and painter, part of a family of artists, son of Battista Angolo del Moro (c. 1515-c. 1573). Battista married the daughter of Francesco Torbido (called il Moro) and added her family nickname to his surname. Battista practised as a decorative fresco painter in the Veneto in the second half of the 16th century and was the first of an important group of etchers active in and around Verona and Venice at that time. His Mannerist style was perpetuated by his sons Marco Angolo del Moro and Giulio Angolo del Moro. Marco also followed in his father's footsteps as an etcher, whereas Giulio was active also as a sculptor."
122,"ANGRAND, Charles","(b. 1854, Criquetot-sur-Ouville, d. 1926, Rouen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/angrand/biograph.html,"
French painter, son of a country school teacher. He was trained at the Académie de Peinture et de Dessin in Rouen, where he won prizes. Although he failed to gain entry to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Angrand began to win a controversial local reputation for canvases in a loosely Impressionist manner. In 1882 he secured a post as a schoolteacher at the Collège Chaptal in Paris. With this security he was able to make contacts in progressive artistic circles, and in 1884 he became a founder-member of the Salon des Indépendants. His paintings of this period depict rural interiors and kitchen gardens, combining the broken brushwork of Monet and Camille Pissarro with the tonal structure of Bastien-Lepage (e.g. In the Garden, 1884; private collection)."
123,"ANGUIER, François","(b. 1604, Eu, d. 1669, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anguier/francois/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, part of a French family of sculptors. Honoré Anguier (c. 1570-1648) was a carpenter, wood-carver and small-scale entrepreneur in Eu, Normandy. Local church archives document his work on doors, frames, balustrades and retables. His eldest son, François Anguier, became noted for his funerary sculpture but also contributed to decorative schemes for ecclesiastic and secular buildings. His younger son, Michel Anguier, worked in Rome before returning to Paris where he enjoyed royal and aristocratic patronage and became a distinguished teacher and lecturer at the Académie Royale. Both François and Michel introduced a new Roman influence, helping to form the classical style in France. A third brother, Guillaume Anguier (1628-1708), was a successful decorative painter, working at various royal residences; one of his daughters married the sculptor Domenico Cucci. Catherine Anguier, sister of François, Michel and Guillaume, was the mother of the sculptor David Bouderelle, who inherited the family house and studio."
124,"ANGUIER, Michel","(b. ca. 1613, Eu, d. 1686, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anguier/michel/biograph.html,"
Michel and François Anguier were brothers and sculptors, who stood apart from the mainstream which in the middle of the 17th century was dominated by Sarazin. They went to Rome about 1641 and joined the studio of Algardi. On their return to France (François in 1643, Michel in 1651), the brothers collaborated on the tomb of Henry de Montmorency in the chapel of the Lycée at Moulins (1648-52), which reveals the new Roman influence they introduced into France. Later the two brothers worked mainly apart, Michel having the more interesting career. His works includes the decoration of the interior of the church of the Val-de-Grace, Paris (1662-67), and the Nativity group in St Roch, Paris (1665).



"
125,"ANGUISSOLA, Lucia","(b. 1538, Cremona, d. 1565, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anguisso/lucia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of six painter sisters from Cremona: Sofonisba, Lucia, Europa (c. 1542-c. 1578), Elena (fl 1546-84), Minerva (fl 1558-69) and Anna-Maria (c. 1555-c. 1611)."
126,"ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba","(b. ca. 1530, Cremona, d. 1625, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anguisso/sofonisb/biograph.html,"
Italian portrait painter from Cremona, the first woman artist to achieve international renown. She was one of six painter sisters: (1) Sofonisba, (2) Lucia (c. 1542–c. 1578), Europa (c. 1542–c. 1578), Elena (fl 1546–84), Minerva (fl 1558–69) and Anna-Maria (c. 1555–c. 1611)."
127,ANQUETIN. Louis,"(b. 1861, Étrépagny, nr Gisors, d. 1932, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anquetin/biograph.html,"
French painter. He settled in Paris in 1882, his apartment on the Avenue de Clichy and his parents' house at Étrépagny became the rendezvous for international artists. He studied art at the Ateliers of Bonnat and Cormon, where he was a contemporary and friend of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. His early work shows the influence of Impressionism and of Edgar Degas. In 1887 Anquetin and Bernard devised an innovative method of painting using strong black contour lines and flat areas of colour; Anquetin aroused much comment when he showed his new paintings, including the striking Avenue de Clichy: Five O'Clock in the Evening at the exhibition of Les XX in Brussels and at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in 1888. The new style, dubbed Cloisonnisme by the critic Edouard Dujardin (1861-1949), resulted from a study of stained glass, Japanese prints and other so-called 'primitive' sources; it was close to the Synthetist experiments of Paul Gauguin and was adopted briefly by van Gogh during his Arles period. Anquetin's works were shown alongside Gauguin's and Bernard's at the Café Volpini exhibition in 1889, where they attracted considerable attention among younger artists."
128,"ANSALDO, Giovanni Andrea","(b. 1584, Voltri, d. 1638, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ansaldo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His first teacher was Orazio Cambiaso, son of Luca Cambiaso, from whom he learnt the principles of design and acquired his proficiency in the use of colour. Ansaldo's appreciation of colour must also have owed something to Veronese, whose works he copied as a student. Orazio Cambiaso's large canvas of St James Converting Josiah  (c. 1600; Genoa, Oratory of S Giacomo delle Fucine) is one of many sources for Ansaldo's multi-figured and highly detailed compositions, set in a deep architectural space. The elegant figures and subtle tonalities of his early works are derived also from the work of Tuscan Mannerist artists in Genoa, such as Pietro Sorri (1556-1621), Ventura Salimbeni and Aurelio Lomi (1556-1622). The sumptuous draperies and strong chiaroscuro contrasts of Giovanni Battista Paggi, who had adopted the Tuscan manner after a period in Florence, influenced Ansaldo, as did the rich impasto of Bernardo Strozzi and Simone Barabbino (b 1585)."
129,"ANSELMI, Michelangelo","(b. ca. 1492, Siena or Lucca, d. 1556, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anselmi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was arguably the most imaginative painter in Parma in the early 16th century after Correggio and Parmigianino. However, he was trained in Siena, though his only surviving work there, a Visitation in the church of Fontegiusta, shows the importance of Sodoma in the formation of his art."
130,"ANTELAMI, Benedetto",(active 1170-1230 in Parma),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antelami/biograph.html,"
Italian Romanesque sculptor, the most notable figure in the history of Italian sculpture before Nicola Pisano. His name first appears on a marble panel representing the Descent from the Cross in Parma Cathedral. He is chiefly known for his reliefs on the doors of the Baptistery at Parma, which was begun in 1196, and it has been suggested that he may have overseen the whole structure as architect as well as sculptor. On stylistic grounds he has also been credited with a hand in the sculptural decorations of Fidenza Cathedral (formerly Borgo San Donnino) and of S. Andrea at Vercelli. His elongated figures, compact compositions, and skilful use of drapery folds give his work a gravity and dramatic expressiveness hitherto unknown to north Italian sculpture.



"
131,"ANTHONISZ, Aert","(b. 1579/80, Antwerpen, d. 1620, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anthoni/biograph.html,"
Aert Anthonisz. Anthonissen, Dutch marine painter. Until 1973 he was known as Aart van Antum, after an erroneous interpretation of his early signatures. He was born in Antwerp, but moved to Amsterdam at an early age, presumably around 1590. He was possibly a pupil of Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom. In 1603 he signed a paper in Amsterdam that he was 23 years old and had lived there for 12 years, when he married Baycken Coutermans from Mechelen. She in turn was given power of attorney by him to settle an inheritance in Mechelen in 1614."
132,"ANTHONISZ, Cornelis","(b. ca. 1499, Amsterdam, d. ca. 1555, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/anthonis/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, etcher, and designer of woodcuts, maternal grandson of Jacob Cornelisz. van Oostsanen. He was the dominant figure in the creation of north Netherlandish woodcuts from the mid-1530s until his death. His monogram, which combines the initials ‘C' and ‘T' with the staff and bell of St Anthony, was probably inspired by his father's first name. He was active in Amsterdam and in 1544 made a large map of that city, now in the Weigh House there. He worked as a cartographer in the service of emperor Charles V and also painted group portraits, most notably the Civic Guard (Historical Museum, Amsterdam), an early example of a type for which Frans Hals later became renowned.



"
133,ANTICO,"(b. ca. 1460, Mantova, d. 1528, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antico/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, goldsmith, and medallist, original name: Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi. An expert in goldsmith work, bronze sculpture and medals, he earned his nickname 'Antico' because of his classically inspired statuettes, which won him great popularity.

He achieved lasting fame through his small-scale re-creations (often also reinterpretations) of famous, but often fragmentary, statues of antiquity (e.g. the Apollo Belvedere and the Spinario). Most of these bronze statuettes were made for the Gonzaga family, notably for Ludovico, Bishop of Mantua, and for Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, 4th Marchese of Mantua. Antico also restored ancient marble statues and acted as an adviser to collectors."
134,"ANTIGNA, Alexandre","(b. 1817, Orléans, d. 1878, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antigna/biograph.html,"
Alexandre (Jean-Pierre-Alexandre) Antigna, French painter. He was taught at the school of drawing in Orléans by a local painter, François Salmon (1781-1855). On 9 October 1837 he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, first in the atelier of Sebastien Norblin de la Gourdaine (1796-1884). A year later he became a pupil of Paul Delaroche, from whom he acquired his understanding of dramatic composition."
135,"ANTOINE, Jacques-Denis","(b. 1733, Paris, d. 1801, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antoine/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the son of a joiner and trained as a builder, becoming a mason and, by the age of 20, a building contractor. He received no formal education and did not undertake the conventional study tour abroad, preferring to pursue theoretical studies on his own, although he did eventually visit Italy in 1777-78."
136,"ANTOLINEZ, Francisco","(b. 1644, Sevilla, d. 1700, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antoline/francisc/biograph.html,"
Francisco Antolinez y Sarabia (also Francisco Antolinez y Ochoa), Spanish painter, nephew of José Antolinez. Originally he studied law in Seville, but went to his uncle at Madrid in 1672 and became a painter. He produced small pictures from the Bible and the life of the Virgin. His only signed painting is The Adoration of the Shepherds (Cathedral, Seville).



"
137,"ANTOLINEZ, José","(b. 1635, Madrid, d. 1675, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antoline/jose/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter active in Madrid, where he was the equivalent of Murillo in Seville. In his genre scenes the influence of Velázquez, as well as that of Murillo, is evident - e.g. The Picture Seller (Munich) -  but his style derives from the Venetians and from Rubens. He specialized in the typically Spanish subject of the Immaculate Conception, of which at least twenty-five versions by him are known. He also painted portraits. There are works in Amsterdam, Barnard Castle (Bowes Museum), Copenhagen, Dublin, Madrid, Oxford (Ashmolean) and Seville.



"
138,"ANTOLINI, Giovanni Antonio","(b. 1756, Castel Bolognese, d. 1841, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antolini/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and writer. When still quite young, he was taught geometry and hydraulics by the engineer Vincenzo Baruzzi. At the age of 20, he went to Rome. In 1776, he assisted with the drainage of the Pontine Marshes but, after catching malaria, soon returned to Rome. As a result, he decided to devote the rest of his career to architecture."
139,"ANTONELLI, Alessandro","(b. 1798, Ghemme, d. 1788, Maggiora)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonel/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. His most famous works are the Mole Antonelliana in Turin (named for him) and in Novara the Cathedral and the Basilica of San Gaudenzio."
140,ANTONELLO da Messina,"(b. 1430, Messina, d. 1479, Messina)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonell/biograph.html,"Italian painter who probably introduced oil painting and Flemish pictorial techniques into mid-15th-century Venetian art. Vasari says that Antonello brought the 'secret' of oil painting to Venice. While this is probably untrue, his San Cassiano altarpiece was certainly influential, for several younger Venetian artists borrowed directly from it and Giovanni Bellini admired the modelling of its figures. His practice of building form with colour rather than line and shade greatly influenced the subsequent development of Venetian painting.

"
141,ANTONIAZZO ROMANO,(c. 1430-1508/12),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antoniaz/biograph.html,"Antoniazzo Romano (Antonio Aquilio) was a pupil of Benozzo Gozzoli, mainly active in Rome. He was a painter from the Colonna rione (quarter) of Rome who worked in the city for more than forty years and whose figurative style was enriched over the years by Umbrian (Perugino, Melozzo da Forli) and Florentine (Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Fra Angelico) influences. Antoniazzo's importance as an entrepreneur was evidently considerable: he made it his business to associate with painters not yet well-known in Rome, guaranteeing them major commissions, which he was able to obtain to his contacts with patrons. This position was confirmed when in 1478 he became the head of the guild of painters and illuminators of Rome. It was Antoniazzo who revised the guild's statutes.

"
142,ANTONIO DA ATRI,"(b. ca. 1350, Atri, d. 1433, Atri)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/atri/biograph.html,"
Antonio da Atri (Antonio Martini di Atri), Italian painter. His artistic career was reconstructed based on the two dated and signed paintings on the eastern wall of the choir of the Cistercian abbey of Santa Maria Arabona Manoppello, depicting the Crucifixion and the Virgin Enthroned with the Child. Under the latter there is an inscription in semi-gothic which reads ""AD MCCCLXXIII ANTONIUS ADRIA DE FECIT."""
143,ANTONIO DA CREVALCORE,"(b. ca. 1440, Crevalcore, d. ca. 1525, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/crevalco/biograph.html,"
Antonio da Crevalcore (Antonio Leonelli), Italian painter and musician. Although Antonio da Crevalcore was highly regarded by his contemporaries as both a painter of still-lifes and a musician, his artistic oeuvre remains the subject of debate. It has been suggested that he trained in Ferrara, because of the stylistic similarities his work shares with other Ferrarese painters working in Bologna, such as Francesco del Cossa and Ercole de' Roberti. The influence of Cossa's Bolognese painting on Crevalcore is clear, especially of the Pala dei Mercanti (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna), but the connection between Cossa's Ferrarese works or Ercole de' Roberti's later Ferrarese paintings and Crevalcore is less evident."
144,ANTONIO DA FABRIANO,(active 1447-1489),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/fabriano/biograph.html,"
Antonio da Fabriano (Antonio di Agostino di ser Giovanni) was an Italian painter and sculptor. He worked mainly in the Marches, but it has been suggested that he was in Naples in 1440-45 and possibly trained there. This is reinforced by the apparent influence of Antonello da Messina in his two dated autograph paintings, St Jerome in his Study (1451; Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery) and a Crucifixion (1452; Matelica, Museo Piersanti). The composition of another early work, the Death of the Virgin (Fabriano, Pinacoteca Civica e Museo degli Arazzi), also reflects prototypes produced in southern Italy. Works attributed to him include a fresco fragment of St Bernardino of Siena (1451) and a triptych of the Virgin and St Anne with Sts Joseph and Joachim (both Gualdo Tadino, Pinacoteca Comunale), a panel of St Jerome and a double-sided standard of the Virgin and Child and St Clement (both Genga, San Clemente)."
145,ANTONIO DA FIRENZE,(active in the first half of the 15th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/firenze/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (Antonio di Jacopo), active probably between 1415 and 1440. Only a few altarpieces are known by him (in the Hermitage, St. Petersburg and the Cini Collection, Venice).

Fra Antonio Falier da Negroponte, painter of Greek origin, active in Italy. He came from Negroponte, a Venetian colony, now the island of Euboea in Greece, which fell to the Turks in 1470."
147,ANTONIO DA TRENTO,(active c. 1527 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/trento/biograph.html,"
Italian printmaker. Of six documented chiaroscuro woodcuts by the artist (two signed, four mentioned by Vasari), five are skilfully cut in a very controlled two-block style, for example Nude Man in a Landscape. The sixth, the Martyrdom of Two Saints, is among the best of Italian multiple-block chiaroscuros. All are after designs by Parmigianino."
148,ANTONIO VENEZIANO,(active 1369-1419),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/venezian/biograph.html,"
Antonio Veneziano (Antonio di Francesco da Venezia), Italian painter. Documents dated 1369-70 record that he produced a series of paintings, including frescoes in two chapels, for Siena Cathedral (all untraced). On 20 September 1374 he was registered as a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Florence. He is documented from 1384 until 3 March 1388 in Pisa, where he painted three large frescoes in the Camposanto: the Return of St Ranierus to Pisa, the Death and Burial of St Ranierus and Posthumous Miracles of St Ranierus (1384-86; Museo delle Sinopie, Pisa). Antonio Veneziano was registered, with interruptions, in the Florentine tax records until at least 1393."
149,ANTONIO DI VINCENZO,"(b. ca. 1350, Bologna, d. ca. 1402, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antonio/vincenzo/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active mainly in his native Bologna. In 1384, he designed the Palazzo della Mercanzia (Loggia of Merchants) in Bologna, which is built in brick and terracotta. The shrine crowns a pair of arches. The loggia partially collapsed under the bombing of 1943, but was faithfully rebuilt after the War."
150,"ANTROPOV, Aleksey Petrovich","(b. 1716, St. Petersburg, d. 1795, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/antropov/biograph.html,"
Russian painter. He was a portraitist but also an accomplished icon painter, miniaturist, and metal worker. He was born in St. Petersburg, to the family of a military carpenter. He trained at the Construction Office in St Petersburg, where his teachers included Ivan Vishnyakov, in whose team of painters Antropov later worked. He participated in the decorative painting of the Winter Palace and other imperial residences in St Petersburg and its environs."

Italian architect, part of a family of architects, brother of Giovanni Battista Aostalli. Ulrico came from a Ticinese family of builders. From the 1540s he was in royal service in Prague. In 1548 he was a member of a masonry group working at the St. Vitus Cathedral. In 1558-59 he worked on Prague Castle, and in 1567 he became master builder at Prague Castle. In 1570 he was named director of royal buildings. From 1573 to 1583 he was responsible for the superintendence of the royal possessions as a building administrator of the Prague Castle."
152,APOLLONIO DI GIOVANNI,"(b. ca. 1414, Firenze, d. 1465, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/apolloni/biograph.html,"
Apollonio di Giovanni di Tomaso was an Italian painter and miniaturist. He specialised in the figurative decoration of cassoni."
153,"APPIANI, Andrea","(b. 1754, Milano, d. 1817, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/appiani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the leading Italian painter of the Neoclassical period, but more on account of the lack of native competition than because of the quality of his work, which generally looks like a rather tired imitation of David. Most of his career was spent in his native Milan, where he did large decorative schemes at Sta Maria presso S. Celso (1792-98) and the Palazzo Reale (1808). He also painted numerous portraits, which are generally more accomplished than his decorative work.



"
154,"APSHOVEN, Thomas van","(b. ca. 1622, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1665, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/apshoven/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, pupil of David Teniers the Younger. He successfully imitated David Teniers's style, and his paintings may easily be mistaken for those of Teniers. The subjects of his paintings, like those of his master, are village festivals, interiors of cabarets with peasants regaling and amusing themselves, corps-de-gardes, and chemists' laboratories.



"
155,"APT, Ulrich the Elder","(b. ca. 1460, Augsburg, d. 1522, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/apt/biograph.html,"
German painter, together with his son active in Augsburg, which alongside Nuremberg was one of the leading centres of artistic production in 16th-century Germany. (From Augsburg came important artistic families such as the Holbeins.)"
156,"ARALDI, Alessandro","(b. ca. 1460, Parma, d. ca. 1530, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/araldi/biograph.html,"
Alessandro Araldi is an Italian painter of Parma about whom little is known. He was an assistant to Cristoforo Caselli, and in the Mazzola workshop. He was influenced by Francia and Costa. He borrowed from the moderate Bolognese Classicism.

157,ARCANGELO DI JACOPO DEL SELLAIO,"(b. 1477/78, Firenze, d. 1530, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arcangel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, son of Jacopo del Sellaio. His work was first grouped together under the name of the ""Master of the Miller Tondo"". The oeuvre of the master was later definitively linked with Arcangelo del Sellaio."
158,"ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe","(b. 1526, Milano, d. 1593, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arcimbol/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and tapestry designer, active also in Austria and Bohemia. He came from a distinguished Milanese family that included a number of archbishops of the city; his father was the painter Biagio Arcimboldo. He is first documented in 1549, working with his father for Milan Cathedral; he received payments until 1558 for supplying paintings, designs for an altar baldachin and stained-glass windows for the cathedral."
159,"ARELLANO, Juan de","(b. 1614, Santorcaz, d. 1676, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arellano/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was the pre-eminent painter of flower-pieces in 17th-century Spain. Although Spaniards of the previous generation had painted such works, it was the inspiration of Flemish and Italian examples in Madrid that from c. 1650 encouraged Arellano's success as a specialist in this genre. First he was inspired by the Antwerp flower painters (Jan Brueghel the Elder and Daniel Seghers), later by Italians such as Mario Nuzzi and Margarita Caffi. According to Palomino, who moved to the Court shortly after the artist's death and befriended many painters who had known him, Arellano began to paint flowers only in his thirties after a beginning that showed little promise. When asked why he devoted himself to flower-pieces and had abandoned figures, he replied that it was because with them he worked less and earned more (Palomino)."
160,"ARENTSZ., Arent","(b. ca. 1585, Amsterdam, d. 1631, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arentsz/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, called Cabel. He gained his sobriquet 'Cabel' from the name of his house on the Prinsengracht, Amsterdam. His highly realistic summer and winter landscapes are closely related to those of his exact contemporary, Hendrick Avercamp, who was born in Amsterdam, but moved to Kampen as an infant. The nature of the two artists' professional relationship is unknown, although it is interesting to note the evidence of Avercamp's direct influence on Arentsz.



"
161,"ARFE, Enrique de","(b. ca. 1475, Harff, d. 1545, León)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arfe/enrique/biograph.html,"
Spanish goldsmith of German origin (Heinrich von Harff). He established himself in León, Spain, c. 1505. He introduced new types of ecclesiastical silver into Spain, for example the so-called 'seated' monstrances, transforming tower-shaped structures into free-standing objects. He executed monstrances for León Cathedral (begun 1506; destroyed), the monastery of S Benito, Sahagún (Sahagún, Ayuntamiento, Museum), Córdoba Cathedral (1518; in situ) and possibly also that in Cádiz Cathedral (1528; in situ). Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo, commissioned from de Arfe a magnificent processional cross (1515–24; Toledo Cathedral) decorated with silver-gilt statuettes. De Arfe also executed a number of silver pieces for the diocese of León, for example the processional cross of Villamunio, the shrine of S Froilán (1519–20; in situ) in León Cathedral and the processional cross and the Reliquary of the Holy Cross of the Colegiata de S Isidoro, León. He also made the four sceptres (1527) in Oviedo Cathedral.

Russian painter and teacher, one of the founders of the Russian school of portrait painting. He came from a family of serfs, belonging to the Counts Sheremetev, that produced several painters and architects. He had grown in the family of his uncle, Semyon Mikhaylovich Argunov who was a steward of princess Cherkassky and later a major-domo for count Sheremetev."

English textile industrialist and inventor whose use of power-driven machinery and employment of a factory system of production were perhaps more important than his inventions."
165,ARNOLD OF WESTPHALIA,"(b. ca. 1425, Leipzig, d. 1480, Meissen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arnold/biograph.html,"
Arnold of Westphalia (Arnold von Westfalen), German architect. He probably came from the respected Leipzig family of Westfal; there is no evidence to support the long-held assumption that he originated from Westphalia. He served his apprenticeship and did his first work under Hans Kumoller at St Nicholas's Church (completed 1447), Zerbst. In 1456 he was Master of the Works at the Archbishop's Palace and St Stephen's Church at Calbe an der Saale, and in 1460-66, under the direction of Kumoller, he was building bridges over the River Elbe at Dresden and Meissen. Work at Schloss Hinterglauchau (1460-70) and on the choir of the church of the Holy Cross at Dresden are also attributed to his early period."
166,"ARNOLDI, Alberto",(active 1351-1364 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arnoldi/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor perhaps of Lombard origin, active in Florence. His documented works are a Madonna and Child between two angels (1359-64) for the altar of the Oratory of the Bigallo, and a relief (Madonna and Child) in the lunette on the door of the same Oratory (1361). In the latter his manner shows great simplicity, partly derived from Andrea Pisano. The reliefs of the Seven Sacraments on the bell tower of the Santa Maria del Fiore are now also attributed to him, they are earlier than his documented works.

167,ARNOLFO DI CAMBIO,"(b.ca. 1245, Colle di Valdelse, d. ca. 1310, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arnolfo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He is first mentioned in 1265 as Nicola Pisano's assistant on the both on the shrine of S. Dominic in Bologna and the pulpit for Siena Cathedral. In 1277 he went to Rome, where he was in the service of Charles of Anjou; his portrait of Charles (Capitoline Museum, Rome) is one of the earliest portrait statues since the ancient world. His most important surviving work, however, is the tomb of Cardinal de Braye (d. 1282) in S. Domenico at Orvieto, which set the type of wall tomb for more than a century (the cardinal lies on a bier beneath the Madonna and Child in glory). The most famous piece of sculpture attributed to him is the bronze statue of St Peter in St Peter's, Rome."

Portuguese architect, part of an important family of architects. He was the son of João de Arruda the Elder (d. 1490), brother of António de Arruda (doc. 1514), and Francisco de Arruda (c. 1480-1547), and uncle of Miguel de Arruda (c. 1500-1563)"
171,"ARRUDA, Francisco de","(d. 1547, Évora)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arruda/francisc/biograph.html,"
Portuguese military architect. Little is known about the life of the master builder Francisco de Arruda and his older brother Diogo. Francisco is known to have died in 1547, out-living his brother who died in 1531, but the year and place of his birth is unknown, though it may be assumed he came from the Alentejo region as many of his buildings are in that area of Portugal. As well as his brother Diogo, Francisco's son Miguel de Arruda was also later a builder and architect, with projects in Lagos in the Algarve and in the colonies of Brazil and Mozambique."
172,"ARSON, Alphonse-Alexandre","(b. 1822, Paris, d. 1880, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arson/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He started his art career by studying painting but later found that sculpture was his true vocation. Studying sculpture under Joseph Combette (1770-1840), he was introduced to bird subjects and his passion then grew from there."
173,"ARTHOIS, Jacques d'","(b. 1613, Bruxelles, d. 1686, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/arthois/biograph.html,"
Jacques d'Arthois (other spellings: Artoes; Artoies; Artois; Artoos; Artoys), Flemish painter, draughtsman and collector. He was apprenticed to Jan Mertens on 11 January 1625 and became a master in the Brussels painters' guild on 3 May 1634. On 10 July 1636 he married Marie Sampels, who bore him eight children. Besides his son Jan Baptist d'Arthois (b. 1638) and his brother Nicolaes d'Arthois (b. 1617), Jacques had six pupils; one of them, Cornelis van Empel, came from Mechelen, indicating that d'Arthois's fame extended beyond his native city. He was made chartered tapestry cartoon designer of the city of Brussels in 1655. At the time of his death he owned several houses and a substantial paintings collection, though an expansive lifestyle had left him severely in debt.



"
174,"ARTIOLI, Giuseppe",(active 1750-1800 in Mantua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/artioli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally of Cento, but active in Mantua. He was the Italian pioneer of the Neoclassical revival of encaustic, or molten beeswax, medium, an ancient technique, which Pliny the Elder describes in his Natural History. Neoclassical painting drew its ideas and motifs from Graeco-Roman art and artifacts and from the Renaissance classicism of Raphael. The excavations of Herculaneum and Pompei, dating from 1738 and 1748, respectively, stimulated the interest of artists, amateurs and collectors throughout Western Europe."

They studied in Rome (1711-14) and developed further the dramatic effects of light and illusionism with which Italian Baroque artists, notably Bernini and Pozzo, had experimented. Both men worked as architects, but Cosmas Damian was also a prolific fresco painter, and Egin Quirin was a sculptor and stuccoist. They worked best as a team, and their ecclesiastical buildings were the supreme expression of the Bavarian delight in decorative display; architecture, painting and sculpture unite to set a scene in which light and colour are the chief actors. The best known of their churches is that of St John Nepomuk, Munich (1733-46). The brothers themselves paid for the building (which was attached to Egid Quirin's house), and it is often referred to simply as the 'Asamkirche'.

Both men worked as architects, but Cosmas Damian was also a prolific fresco painter, and Egin Quirin was a sculptor and stuccoist. They worked best as a team, and their ecclesiastical buildings were the supreme expression of the Bavarian delight in decorative display; architecture, painting and sculpture unite to set a scene in which light and colour are the chief actors. The best known of their churches is that of St John Nepomuk, Munich (1733-46). The brothers themselves paid for the building (which was attached to Egid Quirin's house), and it is often referred to simply as the 'Asamkirche'.

Dutch painter and draftsman, son of portrait painter Hans van Asch. He joined the Guild in 1623 and became a small-scale landscape painter in the manner of his teacher Jan van Goyen and of Salomon van Ruysdael. He did not make many pictures, as he had to take care of his parents. One of his sunny, backlit landscapes is seen in the background of Vermeer's Guitar Player (Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood House, London)"
178,"ASHFORD, William","(b. ca. 1746, Birmingham, d. 1824, Dublin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ashford/biograph.html,"
British painter, who came from Birmingham, settled in Ireland at the age of eighteen and became in time the country's foremost landscape painter. In 1823 he was elected first president of the Royal Hibernian Academy, a considerable honour for a landscapist."
179,"ASHTON, Julian Rossi","(b. 1851, Surrey, d. 1942, Sidney)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ashton/biograph.html,"
Australian painter and writer. He attended the West London School of Art and, following the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, the Académie Julian in Paris. In 1878 the newspaper owner David Syme invited Ashton to Melbourne to produce black-and-white illustrations for the Illustrated Australian News. After a disagreement with the management he transferred to the rival Australasian Sketcher."
180,"ASPERTINI, Amico","(b. ca. 1475, Bologna, d. 1552, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aspertin/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist painter from Bologna, where he was a pupil of Francia. Vasari describes him as having an eccentric personality and this comes out in his paintings, which are often bizarre in expression, like the Holy Family with Saints (St. Nicolas aux Champs, Paris). Aspetini was in Rome 1500-03 and his sketchbooks of Roman  remains (British Museum, London) are important sources about contemporary knowledge of the antique.

"
182,"ASSCHE, Henri van","(b. 1774, Bruxelles, d. 1841, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/assche/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. His first teacher was his father, a distinguished amateur artist. He received further instructions in painting from Jean-Baptiste de Roy (1759-1839). Journeys in Switzerland and Italy contributed to develop his talent as a landscape painter. His paintings representing waterfalls, mountain streams, and mills gained for him the name of 'The Painter of Waterfalls.' Some of his paintings are enriched with figures and animals by Balthasar Paul Ommeganck."
183,"ASSELYN, Jan","(b. 1610, Diepen, d. 1652, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/asselyn/biograph.html,"
Dutch Italianate landscape painter (also spelled Asselijn). According to the Amsterdam burgher book of 1652, Asselyn came from 'Diepen', which can be interpreted as either the village Diemen, near Amsterdam or the French town of Dieppe in northern France."
184,"ASSERETO, Gioachino","(b. 1600, Genova, d. 1649, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/assereto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. At the age of 12 he studied with Luciano Borzone and c. 1614 entered the Genoese studio of Andrea Ansaldo. Among a number of lost early paintings was a large Temptation of St Anthony done at the age of 16. Several complex compositions with small figures, including the Apotheosis of St Thomas Aquinas (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts), the Last Supper (Genoa, Museo Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti), the Stoning of St Stephen (Lucca, Museo e Pinacoteca Nazionale) and the Crowning of the Virgin (Taggia, Dominican Convent), perhaps date from 1616-26. These are close in style to works such as Bernardo Strozzi's bozzetto (c. 1620, Genoa, Museo Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti) for an altarpiece of Paradise (destroyed) and to other contemporary works by Ansaldo, Giulio Benso and Giovanni Andrea de' Ferrari, which also derive their figure style from Mannerism."
185,"ASSTEYN, Bartholomeus","(b. 1607, Dordrecht, d. after 1667, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/assteyn/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Dordrecht artist Bartholomeus Assteyn is believed to have gained his training from his father Abraham Bartolomeusz., following which, in 1631, he became a member of the painters' guild in Dordrecht. He spent his career painting still-lifes in the tradition of the Middelburg school. Early works reveal the clear influence of paintings by the Bosschaert family and Balthasar van der Ast. The elements that make up his compositions, from the tulips and the pink rose to the lizard and flies, appear in many of his paintings and, like the Middelburg painters, he used them in various combinations throughout his career. His later paintings reveal the influence of Jan Davidsz. and Cornelis de Heem."
186,"AST, Balthasar van der","(b. 1594, Middelburg, d. 1657, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ast/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter, the brother-in-law of Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, with whom he trained in Middelburg. He worked in Utrecht before settling in Delft in 1632. His touch was less exquisite than Bosschaert's, but his range was wider, his paintings often including fruit and shells as well as flowers. Jan Davidsz. de Heem was his pupil in Utrecht.

187,"ASTOR, Diego de","(b. ca. 1587, Mechelen, d. ca. 1650, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/astor/biograph.html,"
Spanish engraver and medallist of Flemish birth. From the beginning of the 17th century until 1609 he lived in Toledo, where, under the supervision of El Greco, he worked as an engraver and printed (1605-06) such works of his master as Sts Peter and Paul (1603-07; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and St Francis and Brother Leo (c. 1600-05; Ottawa, National Gallery). Other engravings from this period include frontispieces for Historia de ... Nuestra Señora de Valvanera (Ávila, 1607) by Francisco de Ariz and the Index librorum prohibitorum (Madrid, 1612) by Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, the Archbishop of Toledo. From 1609 to 1636 he was engraver at the Casa de Moneda in Segovia, where he created designs for currency and made the printing plates. He also executed engravings for Obras espirituales (Alcalá de Henares, 1618) by St John of the Cross and the frontispiece for Historia ... de Segovia (Segovia, 1637) by Diego de Colmenares."
188,"ASTRUC, Zacharie","(b. 1833, Angers, d. 1907, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/astruc/biograph.html,"
French painter, sculptor, journalist and poet. He became a well known art critic in Paris between 1859 and 1872, acting as spokesman and defender of the artistic avant-garde in Paris, most notably Gustave Courbet and Edouard Manet, whose cause he championed in such major Parisian newspapers and journals as Le Salon (1863), L'Etendard (1866-68), Echo des Beaux-Arts (May-July 1870)."
189,ATTAVANTE DEGLI ATTAVANTI,"(b. 1452, Castelfiorentino, d. ca. 1525, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/attavant/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. He has been praised by art historians since his own times, although many of his autograph works were incorrectly assigned to his workshop. New attributions, supported by archival material, have made it possible to reconstruct his oeuvre and life more accurately. He worked for celebrated patrons and collaborated with the most important illuminators and painters of Florence: Francesco di Antonio del Chierico, the Master of the Hamilton Xenophon, the brothers Gherardo and Monte di Giovanni di Miniato del Foro and Domenico Ghirlandaio, and documents indicate contacts also with Leonardo da Vinci."
190,"ATTIRET, Claude-François","(b. 1728, Dôle, Jura, d. 1804, Dôle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/attiret/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the son of a joiner, who sent him to Paris to train with Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. In 1757 Attiret was in Rome, where he received a prize from the Accademia di S Luca; returning to Paris, he was accepted as a member of the Académie de St Luc in 1760, and was a professor there."
191,"AUBERT, Jean","(active 1702, d. 1741, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aubert/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer. The son of a master carpenter employed by the Service des Bâtiments du Roi at various French royal residences, from 1702 to 1708 Aubert worked as a draughtsman under Jules Hardouin-Mansart. He became the favourite architect of the princely Bourbon-Condé family with the remodeling of the château of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés (1709-10), near Paris. For Louis-Henri de Bourbon, Prince de Condé (1692-1740), the grandson of Louis XIV, Aubert carried out several projects at the château of Chantilly (Oise). The magnificent stables (designed 1719, built 1721-35; show the influence of Hardouin-Mansart in Aubert's extensive use of arcades, the discreet presence of the classical orders, and the rich sculptural decoration, all elements drawn from the Grandes et Petites Ecuries of the Palace of Versailles. Aubert's most distinctive stylistic trait, emphatic horizontal channeling of rusticated wall surfaces, made its first appearance on the one-storey elevation of the stable wing facing the meadow."
192,"AUBRY, Etienne","(b. 1745, Versailles, d. 1781, Versailles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aubry/biograph.html,"
French painter. He trained under Jacques-Augustin Silvestre (1719-1809) and Joseph Marie Vien, exhibiting portraits at the Salon from 1771 and becoming a member of the Académie Royale as a portrait painter in 1775. His portraits of such eminent contemporaries as the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck (Musée du Louvre, Paris) are characterized by a quiet, understated elegance."
193,"AUDRAN, Claude III","(b. 1658, Lyon, d. 1734, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/audran/claude3/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a French family of artists who trained with his uncles. He was solely a decorative artist, specializing in painted panelling, harpsichord cases and so on; he was, however, able to renew the genre with his arabesques, grotesques and singeries. He became a master in 1692 as 'painter, sculptor, engraver and decorator'. Payments document the variety of his talents: designing tapestries, painting on glass, executing a 'feu d'artifice', and gilding gondolas for the canal at Fontainebleau. In 1704 he was appointed keeper of the Luxembourg, but continued to be much occupied as a general decorator and designer. He worked at Versailles, Anet, Marly, Sceaux, Meudon and La Muette. He also made many tapestry cartoons for the Gobelins, including the Douze mois grotesques (1699) and the Portieres des dieux. Among his very last work was that in 1733 for the Duchesse de Maine at Anet, where he had first been employed some time before 1698."
194,"AUDRAN, Jean","(b. 1667, Lyon, d. 1756, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/audran/jean/biograph.html,"
French engraver, part of a family of artists, brother of Claude Audran III. He studied engraving in Paris with his uncle Girard Audran, whose collaborator he became, most notably on the reproductive engravings of Charles Le Brun's Battles of Alexander the Great. Jean Audran made engravings after Italian masters, such as Pietro da Cortona, Francesco Albani and the Carracci family, and after 17th-century French masters, including Nicolas Poussin, Jean Jouvenet, Antoine Dieu, Antoine Coypel and Hyacinthe Rigaud. Later he reproduced works by more modern painters, such as Claude Gillot or Watteau, making 110 etchings for the latter's Figures de différents caractères (c. 1735). Jean's numerous works, like those of his uncle, often harmoniously combine etching and line engraving. In 1707 he was appointed Graveur Ordinaire du Roi; having been approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1704, he was admitted (reçu) in 1708, with engravings of a portrait of Antoine Coysevox after Rigaud and of a Self-portrait after Noel Coypel.


"
195,"AUDUBON, John James","(b. 1785, Les Cayes, Haiti, d. 1851, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/audubon/biograph.html,"
American naturalist and traveller of French extraction, who studied in Paris under Jacques-Louis David, before going to America in 1803. His most famous works are the illustrations for The Birds of America (1827-38), the original drawings for which are in New York (Historical Society), and the Quadrupeds of North America (1845-48). There are oils and watercolours in Liverpool (University).



"
196,"AUGUSTIN, Jacques-Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1759, Saint-Dié, d. 1832, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/augustin/biograph.html,"
French painter. After receiving instruction in art from Jean Girardet (1709–78) and Jean-Baptiste-Charles Claudot (1733–1805), he went to Paris in 1781, where he won recognition as a miniature painter. The miniatures he painted in the 1790s, for example his portrait of Mme Vanhée, née Dewinck (1792; Paris, Louvre), are among his most animated works; often portraying figures in a landscape setting, they develop the exuberant style of Niclas Lafrensen and Peter Adolf Hall. He also admired the work of Jean-Baptiste Greuze, whose Bacchante (Waddesdon Manor, Bucks, NT) in his own collection he copied in miniature (London, Wallace) and in enamel (Paris, Louvre).



"
197,"AVANZI, Jacopo",(active 1363-1384),https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/avanzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. At least two painters of this name were recorded in Bologna: a Jacopo di Pietro Avanzi, who was dead by 1378, and one who was paid for a small commission on 13 April 1384. This has led to much confusion. The earliest reference is to a Iacobus Avancini depintor, resident in 1363 in the parish of S Cecilia in the Porta Piera quarter of Bologna. On 28 February 1375 a Jacopo Avanzi witnessed a notarial act and on 23 June 1377 a Jacopo Avanzi was one of several craftsmen paid for a bishop's pallium."
198,"AVED, Jacques-André-Joseph","(b. 1702, Douai, d. 1766, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/aved/biograph.html,"
French painter and collector. His father, Jean-Baptiste Havet, a doctor of Armenian origin, died when Aved was a child. He was brought up in Amsterdam by his step-father, a captain in the Dutch Guards. At 16 he is said to have become a pedlar or 'camelot' (hence the nickname Camelot given to him by his French acquaintances) travelling through the Netherlands, drawing portraits at fairs. In 1721, after spending short periods in the Amsterdam studios of the French engraver Bernard Picart and of the draughtsman François Boitard, he left the Netherlands to work in the Paris studio of the fashionable portrait painter Alexis-Simon Belle. At this time he met other notable painters including Carle Van Loo and the portrait painters Maurice Quentin de La Tour, Jean-Baptiste Perronneau and Jean-Etienne Liotard. He also formed a deep and lasting friendship with Jean-Siméon Chardin, with whom he may have collaborated on occasion; they used similar techniques, and he may have encouraged Chardin to turn from still-life painting to figure painting in the 1730s."

201,"AVELLI, Francesco Xanto","(b. ca. 1487, Rovigo, d. ca. 1542, Urbino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/avelli/biograph.html,"
Italian maiolica painter, ceramicist. More is known about Avelli than any other maiolica painter because of his many signed works and the autobiographical details included in his sonnets in honour of Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. Avelli considered himself to be not only an artist but also a poet and courtier. His intellectual abilities set him apart from his colleagues, even if as a painter he was not the most talented. He seems never to have directed his own workshop, but he is known to have worked in Urbino from 1530, the year of his first unequivocally signed and dated plate; some pieces from the 1520s signed F.R. and F.L.R. may also be ascribed to him."
202,"AVERCAMP, Barend","(b. ca. 1612, Kampen, d. 1679, Kampen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/avercamp/barend/biograph.html,"
Barend (or Barent) Avercamp, Dutch painter and illustrator, the nephew and pupil of Hendrick Avercamp whose style he consistently continued. He lived in Kampen for most of his life but spent extended periods in Zwolle (?1615-26) and Zutphen (?1640-50). He married in 1640 he married Mechtelt Hoberinck, and later in 1658 he married his second wife, Aeltien Gerrits."
203,"AVERCAMP, Hendrick","(b. 1585, Amsterdam, d. 1634, Kampen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/avercamp/hendrick/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in Kampen, the most famous exponent of the winter landscape. He was deaf and dumb and known as `de Stomme van Kampen' (the mute of Kampen). His paintings are colourful and lively, with carefully observed skaters, tobogganers, golfers, and pedestrians. Avercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which are tinted with watercolour, as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors (an outstanding collection is at Windsor Castle). His nephew and pupil Barend Avercamp carried on his style in an accomplished manner. 



"
204,"AYALA, Josefa de","(b. 1630, Sevilla, d. 1684, Óbidos)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/ayala/biograph.html,"
Josefa de Ayala e Cabrera, known as Josefa de Óbidos, Portuguese painter and engraver. She was the daughter of the Portuguese painter Baltazar Gomes Figueira (1597-1674) and a Spanish lady, Doña Catarina de Ayala y Cabrera. After the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy in 1640 the family moved to Coimbra. Here Josefa began her apprenticeship under her father, a painter of landscapes, still-lifes and religious works, who in 1644 painted the retable of Nossa Senhora da Graça, Coimbra, in the naturalist-tenebrist style he had learnt in Seville in the circles of Juan del Castillo, Juan de Roelas and Francisco de Zurbarán."
205,"AZEGLIO, Massimo Taparelli, Marquis d'","(b. 1798, Torino, d. 1866, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/a/azeglio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, writer and statesman. After visiting Rome in 1814, he lived there intermittently between 1818 and 1828. Until 1820 he trained under Martin Verstappen (1773-1853) and then spent extended periods in the Roman Campagna, sketching and painting numerous landscapes, such as Wood and Glade, Alban Hills (Turin, Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna), which display a lingering 18th-century vocabulary and a northern European taste for detail. In an effort to reconcile his interests as artist, writer and patriot, D'Azeglio began to adapt landscape motifs to heroic scenes from romantic literature and history (especially battles). In the Death of Montmorency (1825; Turin, Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna), a subject taken from a romantic novel by Sophie Cottin (1770-1807), he set out to innovate traditional Netherlandish landscape by substituting knights and paladins for rustic figures. He made a fundamental contribution to the development of history painting in Italy by using his subjects to evoke patriotic sentiment. The Duel of Barletta (1831; private collection) depicts in a conventional manner an episode of 1503 of Italian romantic heroism, which D'Azeglio used again in a celebrated novel of 1833."
206,"BABOCCIO DA PIPERNO, Antonio","(b. ca. 1351, Piperno, d. 1435, Piperno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baboccio/biograph.html,"
Italian abbot, painter, sculptor and goldsmith, originating from Piperno (from 1927 Priverno) in Lazio. His artistic training brings him into contact with different cultures which influence his style: in Milan he works in an environment characterized by the Franco-Flemish and Rhenish cultures, in Bologna he meets the Emilian expressionism. He also works in Venice, Naples, Messina and other centres of the south of the Italian peninsula."
207,"BABUREN, Dirck van","(b. ca. 1590, Utrecht, d. 1624, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baburen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (original name Theodor Baburen) who was a leading member of the Utrecht school, which was influenced by the dramatic chiaroscuro style of the Italian painter Caravaggio."
208,"BACCANELLI, Giovanni Antonio di Giulio",(documented 1630-1661 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baccanel/biograph.html,"

Florentine painter, original name Francesco Ubertini. He was probably a pupil of Perugino but with an eclectic style most heavily influenced by Andrea del Sarto. He painted religious subjects and decorative panels for walls and furniture, and designed tapestries.



"
210,BACCIO d'Agnolo,"(b. 1462, Firenze, d. 1543, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baccio/biograph.html,"
Baccio d'Agnolo (originally Bartolomeo Baglioni) was an Italian woodcarver, sculptor and architect (Baccio is an abbreviation of Bartolomeo). He started as a wood-carver, and between 1491 and 1502 did much of the decorative carving in the church of Santa Maria Novella and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Having made his reputation as a sculptor he appears to have turned his attention to architecture, and to have studied at Rome, though the precise date is uncertain; but at the beginning of the sixteenth century he was engaged with the architect Simone del Pollaiolo in restoring the Palazzo Vecchio, and in 1506 he was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore."
211,"BACHELIER, Nicolas","(b. 1500, Arras, d. 1557, Toulouse)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bachelie/biograph.html,"
French architect, mason and sculptor. He was the dominant sculptor and architect of 16th-century Toulouse and deserves to be placed after Pierre Lescot and Philibert Delorme (both primarily active in the Île de France) among the creators of the French classical style in architecture. His training as a sculptor probably took place in Arras, then a Spanish province in direct contact with Italy, and he probably also studied in Italy before arriving in Toulouse c. 1532. The exceptional quality of his work won him an immediate admiration that lasted into posterity. His origins and training were rapidly surrounded with legends, repeated by Dupuy du Grez in his Traité de peinture (1699), in which Bachelier is described as a pupil of Michelangelo. In the 19th century all important Renaissance monuments between Pau and Cahors were unhesitatingly ascribed to him."
212,BACICCIO,"(b. 1639, Genova, d. 1709, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baciccio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born in Genoa (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) and active mainly in Rome, where he settled in 1657 and became a protégé of Bernini. He achieved success as a painter of altarpieces and portraits (he painted each of the seven popes from Alexander VII to Clement XI), but is remembered mainly for his decorative work and above all for his Adoration of the Name of Jesus (1674-9) on the ceiling of the nave of the Gesu. This is one of the supreme masterpieces of illusionistic decoration, ranking alongside Pozzo's slightly later ceiling in Sant'Ignazio. The stucco figures that are so brilliantly combined with the painted decoration (from the ground it is not always possible to tell which is which) are the work of Bernini's pupil Antonio Raggi (1624-86).

213,"BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz.","(b. 1608, Harlingen, d. 1651, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/backer/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. As we know from several studies and from a portrait of 1649, Jacob Backer was born in Harlingen in 1608. He was the son of Hilk Folkertsdr and the baker Adriaen Tjercksz. His father, who was described as a widower in 1611, subsequently married a widow, Elsjen Roelofs, the owner of a bakery on the Nieuwendijk in Amsterdam. So it happened that at the age of three Jacob Backer moved to Amsterdam. In 1635, his father registered the Dutch name for his profession - baker - as his surname."
214,"BACKER, Jacob de","(b. 1555/60, Antwerpen, d. 1585/90, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/backerde/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Although Jacob de Backer left us a substantial number of paintings and drawings, very little is known of his brief life and career. De Backer joined the workshop of Antonio van Palermo, who reportedly worked his pupil so hard that the strain eventually lead to his premature demise at the age of thirty. Despite this short lived period of activity, De Backer must have produced many versions and copies of his Last Judgment."
215,"BACKHUYSEN, Ludolf","(b. 1631, Emden, d. 1708, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/backhuys/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter, active mainly in Amsterdam. After the van de Veldes moved to England in 1672, Backhuysen became the most popular marine painter in Holland. He captures the drama and movement of ships, but seldom achieves the poetic effects of either van de Velde the Younger or Jan van de Capelle.

His early training is thought to have taken place in the Carracci academy in Bologna and with Agostino Carracci, during the latter's years in Parma in the service of Ranuccio I Farnese (1600-02). Following Agostino's death, Badalocchio and his fellow pupil Giovanni Lanfranco were sent to Rome, where they assisted Annibale Carracci on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese and the Herrera Chapel in Santa Maria di Monserrato, Rome (1602-07; now Museo del Prado, Madrid, and Museu Catalunya, Barcelona). Badalocchio's first independent, signed work is an etching after the antique statue of the Laocoön (1606). The following year, together with Lanfranco, he published a series of 51 etchings after Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican Logge.

Father and son are thought to have visited the Netherlands together, c. 1482-4, but although a Netherlandish influence pervaded their work, Derick's retained a Late Gothic style. He produced several large altarpieces, including the ones for the Dortmunder Propsteikirche and the Mathena Church in Wesel, the Berlin Passion altar and the Parish Church altar in Cologne."
219,"BAELLIEUR, Cornelis de","(b. 1607, Antwerpen, d. 1671, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baellieu/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was apprenticed to Anton Lisaert in 1617. According to Van den Branden, only nine years later did he become a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke, of which he was dean in 1644-45. His son, of the same name, also became a painter, but there is no concrete evidence of his work."
220,"BAEN, Jan de","(b. 1633, Haarlem, d. 1702, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baen/biograph.html,"
Dutch portrait painter, the pupil of Jacob Backer. He was one of the most popular Dutch portrait painters in the years 1665-1700, since he brought to his work the kind of elegance and flattery preferred by his patrons. The son of a merchant, he was already orphaned at the age of three. He was then taken into the household of his uncle, the magistrate and painter Heinrich Piemans (d 1645), who lived in Emden in East Friesland and who later gave him his first lessons in painting. After the death of his uncle, he was apprenticed in 1646 to Jacob Adriaensz. Backer in Amsterdam; after Backer's death in 1651, de Baen remained in Amsterdam, working independently as an artist."
221,"BAERS, Johannes",(active 1624-1641 in Utrecht),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baers/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Little is known about the life and work of Johannes Baers. He may be the Hans Baers, recorded in 1618 as a member of the Antwerp Guild, but his working life seems to have been spent in Utrecht, and his work was recorded in Amsterdam inventories as well. His paintings clearly reflect the influence of both Roelandt Savery and Balthasar van der Ast, both of whom were working in Utrecht in the 1620s.



"
222,"BAERTSOEN, Albert","(b. 1866, Gent, d. 1922, Gent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baertsoe/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter and etcher. The son of a successful mill-owner and an excellent musician, he was a pupil and friend of Gustave Den Duyts (1850-1897), and later, at the Ghent Académie, of Jean Delvin (1853-1922). He was involved in the exhibiting society L'Essor in Brussels as well as the triennial salons held in Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent in rotation."
223,"BAERZE, Jacques de",(active 1390s in Dijon),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baerz/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. He probably came from Gent, and lived in Dendermonde some thirty kilometres away from Dijon. He was clearly a well-established master before the death in January 1384 of the local ruler, Louis II of Flanders, Duke of Brabant, as two commissions from Louis to produce carved altarpieces are recorded, though the works have not survived. These were for the chapel of the castle of Dendermonde, and the hospice of the Cistercian abbey of Bijloke, then just outside Gent."
224,"BAGLIONE, Cesare","(b. ca. 1545, Cremona, d. 1615)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baglion/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of vault decorations, representing one of the best examples of Mannerist fantasy. He worked from 1565 to 1574 in Florence and later at the court of Duke Ottavio Farnese. The execution of grotesques, designed by Raphael and his workshop, was left to specialists in the sixteenth century. We know only a few of their names, including Cesare Baglione, Giovanni da Udine,  and Giovanni Antonio Paganino; many others remain anonymous. Baglione's grotesques and images inspired by the bible decorate the Charterhouse of Paradigna, also known as Valserena, as well as the Marazzani Palace in Piacenza."
225,"BAGLIONE, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1566, Roma d. 1643, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baglione/biograph.html,"
Roman painter, one of Caravaggio's strongest personal adversaries in Roman artistic circles, who is known to posterity almost exclusively through his very sober and reliable ""Vite de' Pittori"" (Lives of Painters), published at the end of his long lifetime. His animosity toward Caravaggio is shown in almost every line of his biography. On the other hand, he was despised and derided by Caravaggio's clique. As an artist Baglione was, strangely enough, a follower of Caravaggio, especially in his use of light and dark. He published a long list of his works at the end of his autobiography, but in spite of some very interesting performances, he never really developed a consistent and expressive artistic personality.



"
226,"BAILLY, David","(b. 1584, Leiden, d. 1657, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bailly/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, pupil of his father, Pieter Bailly from Antwerp and the copper engraver Jacques de Gheyn. He studied portraiture with Cornelis van der Voort in Amsterdam. He made numerous trips abroad and worked for many princes including the Duke of Brunswick. Apart from portraits, he painted still-lifes such as the famous vanitas painting of 1651. Bailly taught his nephews Harmen and Pieter Steenwijck.

227,"BAILLY, Jacques I","(b. ca. 1634, Graçay, d. 1679, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bailly_j/1/biograph.html,"
French miniature painter active in Paris. He illuminated a superb manuscript containing an anthology of devices for Louis XIV's tapestries made in the Gobelins factory. His son Nicolas Bailly (1659-1736) was a painter and printmaker, Painter to the King, his grandson Jacques Bailly II was a flower painter and miniaturist.



"
228,"BAILLY, Jacques II","(b. ca. 1700, Paris, d. 1768, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bailly_j/2/biograph.html,"
French flower painter and miniaturist. He held the title of Painter to the King, as did his father, Nicolas Bailly (1659-1736), a painter and printmaker. He was the grandson of Jacques Bailly I. He compiled a catalogue of pictures in the royal collection at the Palais du Luxembourg.



"
229,"BALASSI, Mario","(b. 1604, Firenze, d. 1667, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balassi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After the initial apprenticeship with Jacopo Ligozzi, the young Florentine painter was taught by Matteo Rosselli and Domenico Passignano. The latter brought him to Rome, where Balassi worked under the protection of the Barberini and Pope Urban VIII. The powerful family commissioned him the Raphaellesque Transfiguration in Santa Maria della Concezione, dated 1630, and the Noli me tangere for San Cajo, influenced by Parmigianino (now Ente Cassa di Risparmio, Florence)."
230,BALDASSARE D' ESTE,"(b. 1432, Reggio Emilia, d. 1506, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldassa/biograph.html,"
Baldassare d'Este (Baldassare da Reggio), Italian painter and medallist. He was brought up as the adopted son of a certain Giovanni Bonayti, but a document of 1489 records him as the (illegitimate) son of Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. In most documents, however, he is called 'Baldassare da Reggio'."
231,"BALDI, Lazzaro","(b. 1623, Pistoia, d. 1703, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After training in Pistoia with Francesco Leoncini, he moved to Rome to study with Pietro da Cortona. In 1656, under the latter's direction, he contributed to the decoration of the Alexander Gallery in the Palazzo del Quirinale, Rome, where he painted scenes of the Creation of Adam and Eve, the Flood and the Annunciation (all in situ). Shortly after 1658 Cardinal Francesco Paolucci commissioned Baldi to paint frescoes of scenes from the Life of St John the Evangelist in the restored tempietto of San Giovanni in Oleo, Rome, works that were deeply influenced by Pietro da Cortona."
232,"BALDINI, Baccio","(b. 1436, ?, d. 1487, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldini/biograph.html,"Italian goldsmith and engraver. According to Vasari, he was a follower of Maso Finiguerra and engraved a series of 19 prints after designs by Botticelli. These illustrate an edition of Dante’s Divine Comedy published in 1481. A group of prints in the same Fine Manner style is attributed to Baldini. His designs incorporate figures and motifs derived from Botticelli, Piero Pollaiuolo and also German printmakers, such as the Master E.S. and Martin Schongauer, but particularly from Finiguerra. Baldini’s Fine Manner style developed from Finiguerra’s niello print technique; the rendering of spatial recession in the large Judgement Hall of Pilate (435 x 598 mm) suggests it was designed by Finiguerra. With the other prints, however, it shares the decorative quality and emphasis on pattern characteristic of Baldini.



"
233,"BALDOVINETTI, Alessio","(b. ca.1425, Firenze, d. 1499, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldovin/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter, mosaicist, and worker in stained glass. His training is unknown, but his graceful, and refined style shows the influence of Domenico Veneziano and Fra Angelico."
234,"BALDRIGHI, Giuseppe","(b. 1723, Stradella, d. 1803, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldrigh/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and pastelist. He completed his first artistic studies in Florence, under the guidance of Vincenzo Meucci (1694-1766), and then went to Parma. From Parma, Guillaume du Tillot, minister of the Bourbon Duke Philip of Parma (1720-1765), sent him for training to Paris from 1752-1756. In Paris Baldrighi was able to work alongside or at least seen the works of painters such as François Boucher, Maurice Quentin de La Tour, Joseph Duplessis, and Alexandre-François Desportes, and in 1754 he was received into the prestigious Académie. "
235,"BALDUCCI, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1560, Firenze, d. after 1631, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balducc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was trained by Giovan Battista Naldini, who was influenced by Vasari and late Florentine Mannerism. Between 1575 and 1579 Balducci collaborated with Federico Zuccaro on Vasari's frescoes of the Last Judgement in the dome of Florence Cathedral. He enrolled in the Accademia del Disegno in 1578. In 1577 and 1580 he worked with Naldini on the decoration of the Altoviti Chapel in Trinità dei Monti, Rome. On his return to Florence, he assisted Alessandro Allori in the decoration of the ceilings in the corridor of the Uffizi gallery. His work on the decoration of Florence Cathedral for the wedding of Ferdinand I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1589, includes the Last Supper. The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (San Gimignano, Sant'Agostino) dates from the same year."
236,"BALDUCCI, Matteo","(b. before 1509, Fontignano, d. 1554, Citta della Pieve)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balducci/biograph.html,"
Italian painter from Umbria. He was the pupil of Pinturicchio and we know from Vasari that he worked with him in Rome. He may have been involved with Pinturicchio in the decoration of the ceiling of the Piccolomini Library in the Cathedral at Siena. He has left several pictures at Siena and Gubbio. These are all Umbrian in treatment, and show the influence of Pinturicchio, but they lack his delicate drawing. However, he remains a shadowy artistic personality.

237,"BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans","(b. 1484/85, Schwäbisch-Gmünd, d. 1545, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baldung/biograph.html,"
German painter and graphic artist. He probably trained with Dürer in Nuremberg, but his brilliant color, expressive use of distortion, and taste for the gruesome bring him closer in spirit to his other great German contemporary, Grünewald. "
238,"BALEN, Hendrick van","(b. 1575, Antwerpen, d. 1632, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balen/biograph.html,"
Flemish Mannerist painter, active mainly in his native Antwerp. He was in Italy in the 1590s. His speciality was mythological scenes painted in the highly finished manner of Jan Brueghel, one of the numerous artists with whom he collaborated. Van Balen was a popular teacher, his most important pupil being Van Dyck. He also had three painter sons.



"
239,"BALESTRA, Antonio","(b. 1666, Verona, d. 1740, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balestra/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. His altarpieces and history paintings, which unite late Baroque classicism with Venetian colour, brought new life to north Italian painting. The son of Lucia Boschetti and Francesco Balestra, a wealthy merchant, he studied literature, rhetoric and the humanities, but, after lessons in drawing and perspective with Giovanni Zeffis (d. 1688) and one Monsignor Bianchini (1646-1724), he moved to Venice in 1687 and trained with Antonio Bellucci. In 1691 he transferred to Rome, where he studied with Carlo Maratti, whose art continued a classical tradition that can be traced back to Raphael, and where he also absorbed the work of Annibale Carracci and Domenichino. In 1694 Balestra's large drawing of the Fall of the Giants (Rome, Galleria Accademia Nazionale di S Luca) won first prize in a competition at the Accademia di S Luca. In 1695 he returned to Verona, where he was acclaimed as the chief exponent in the Veneto of Maratti's late Baroque classicism. His pictures of this period were mainly small religious works, such as the Agony in the Garden (private collection). In Verona he established a school of painting."
240,"BALLU, Théodore","(b. 1817, Paris, d. 1885, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/ballu/biograph.html,"
French architect. He won the Prix de Rome in 1840. The young laureate then left Paris and boarded at the Académie de France a Rome. He lived there from 1841 to 1845 and studied the ruins of Antiquity."
241,"BALTARD, Louis-Pierre","(b. 1764, Paris, d. 1846, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baltard/biograph.html,"
French architect and engraver. He was originally a landscape painter, but in his travels through Italy was so much struck with the beauty of the Italian buildings, that he changed his profession and devoted himself to architecture. In his new occupation he achieved great success, and was selected to prepare the plans for some of the largest public edifices in Paris. His reputation, however, is chiefly based on his great skill in engraving. Among the best known of his plates are the drawings of Paris (Paris el ses monuments, 2 vols. fol., 1803), the engravings for Denon's Égypte, the illustrations of Napoleon's wars (La Colonne de la grande armée), and those contained in the series entitled the Grand prix de l'architecture, which for some time he carried on alone."

South Netherlandish painter, draughtsman, engraver and publisher. He was the son of the sculptor Balten Jansz. de Costere (fl 1524). In 1550 he became a master in the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp and in 1569 its dean. Primarily on the authority of van Mander, Baltens was long considered to be an inferior imitator of Pieter Bruegel the Elder."
243,"BALZICO, Alfonso","(b. 1825, Cava de' Tirreni, d. 1901, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/balzico/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He trained at the Fine Arts Academy in Naples taught by Tito Angelini, a neoclassical sculptor who followed the naturalism of Bartolini and Tenerani. Balzico travelled throughout Italy to increase his artistic knowledge, staying, among others, in Naples, Rome, Milan and Florence. During this period he met Vincenzo Vela, Francesco Hayez and Massimo D'Azeglio, artists who would influence his style encouraging him to move from Neoclassicism to a Realism characterised by a strong Romanticism."
244,BAMBAIA,"(b. 1483, Busto Arsizio, d. 1548, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bambaia/biograph.html,"

Italian painter, a pupil of Sebastiano Mazzoni in Venice, and then of Carlo Maratta in Rome. He was again in Venice from 1687, leaving many altarpieces painted in the manner of Pietro Liberi as well as two canvases for the Doge's Palace. His eclectic, impersonal production, characterized by affected, pearl-suffused colours and the influence of Antonio Balestra, helped to popularise the Roman academic style in Venice.



"
246,"BANDHAUER, Gottfried","(b. 1790, Rosslau, d. 1827, Rosslau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bandhaue/biograph.html,"

Florentine sculptor, painter, and draughtsman. He was a favourite of the Medici family, but he is remembered more for his unattractive character and the antipathy of his contemporaries than for the quality of his work."
248,"BANDINI, Giovanni","(b. 1540, Castello, d. 1599, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bandini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor . His apprenticeship in Baccio Bandinelli's Florentine workshop probably began c. 1555. With his master's death in 1560, he was asked to complete the choir-screen of Florence Cathedral, begun by Bandinelli in 1547; he executed the bas-reliefs on the western side of the screen, completed in 1572 (in situ). Also in 1572, he sculpted a portrait bust of Cosimo I de' Medici, placed over the entrance to the Cathedral Works (Opera del Duomo), and began two column statues of Apostles for the cathedral: St James the Less (1576) and St Philip (1577), all in situ. From his many years of service to the Cathedral Works, Bandini came to be known as Giovanni dell'Opera."

English sculptor. He studied in Rome 1772-79 and in 1781 was employed by Catherine the Great in Russia. Back in England, he became with Flaxman the leader of the Neoclassical movement in sculpture. He developed a particular interest in ancient sarcophagi, and his relief of the Death of Germanicus of 1774 (Earl of Leicester, Holkman Hall, Norfolk) was probably among the first sculptures produced by an English sculptor in a Neoclassical mode."

Hungarian painter. He attended the protestant school of Nagyenyed. He began painting portraits at a young age. He was a pupil of Johann Ender in Vienna for a short time in 1829. After returning to Kolozsvár in 1830, he learnt lithography from Gábor Barra and produced lithographs of particularly high artistic standard all through his life. After spending two years in Bucuresti from 1831, he became a fashionable portrait painter. His study tour in Italy during 1834-1835 proved to be highly fruitful. He took over the technique of painting water colour from W. L. Leitch, an English painter, as well as a novel portrayal of nature. While in Venice, Italy, he copied Veronese's The Rape of Europe, which brought him a good deal of success in Pest in 1835."

French painter and engraver. A pupil in Paris of Jean Restout II, in 1745 he failed to win the Prix de Rome and at his own expense went to Rome early in 1747. The following year, by which time he was a member of the circle of Paolo Anesi, Philothée-François Duflos, Jean-Laurent Legeay and Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Barbault made engravings for the 'Varie vedute di Roma antica e moderna' published in Rome. As a painter he was encouraged by Jean-François de Troy, director of the Académie de France, who commissioned from him 20 small pictures representing characters from the Turkish masquerade organized by the pensionnaires for the carnival of 1748, of which 11 survive (Beauvais, Musée Départemental de l'Oise; Narbonne, Musée d'Art et d'Histoire; Paris, Louvre; and elsewhere). When, by special favour, he became a pensionnaire at the Académie (1749-53), he made a copy (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts, destroyed) for Louis XIV of Luca Penni's fresco the Baptism of Constantine in the Vatican Stanze (it was then attributed to Raphael)."

Together they started a business selling miniatures of antique statues from museums all over Europe."
258,"BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio","(b. 1603, Cento, d. 1649, Cento)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barbieri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the younger brother of Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), and both collaborated with him and worked independently as a still-life painter.  He was a celebrated painter of still-life and animals. He chose for his subjects fruits, flowers, insects and animals, which he painted after nature with a lively tint of colour, great tenderness of pencil, and a strong character of truth and life. He particularly excelled in painting fish, which he represented with astonishing fidelity. Guercino's Libro dei conti, for which, from 1629, Barbieri was responsible, recorded 42 pictures by him, including the Spice Shop."
259,"BARDELLINO, Pietro","(b. 1728, Napoli, d. 1819, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bardelli/biograph.html,"

Dutch painter and draughtsman. He probably received his first training from his father Barend Dircksz., nicknamed 'Doove' (Deaf) Barend. In 1555 he went to Rome and Venice, where he presumably worked for a while in Titian's studio. Other Venetian artists, including Jacopo Bassano, also had an important influence on him. He returned to Amsterdam shortly before or during 1562, the year in which he married Agnies Florisdr., by whom he fathered at least eight children. He remained there for the rest of his life."

Thomas Barker of Bath, English painter and lithographer. He received his early training through the patronage of the Bath auctioneer Charles Spackman, whom he depicted in a joint portrait Thomas Barker and his Preceptor, Charles Spackman (1789; Bath, Victoria Art Gallery). Under Spackman's direction, Barker assiduously copied paintings by the Old Masters, gaining a proficient, if somewhat eclectic technique. The influence of Thomas Gainsborough in particular is evident in such early works as Woodman in a Storm (1789; London, Tate)."
262,"BARKER, Thomas Jones","(b. 1813, Bath, d. 1882, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barker/thomas1/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of artists, son of Thomas Barker. He received his first training from his father and entered the Parisian studio of Horace Vernet in 1834.

Barna (or Berna) da Siena, Italian painter. According to I commentari, written by Lorenzo Ghiberti towards the end of his life, a Sienese painter named Barna painted several works in Tuscany, including many stories from the Old Testament in San Gimignano. Giorgio Vasari, in the first edition of his Vite (1550), listed a number of works by the Sienese painter 'Berna', including frescoed Old Testament scenes in the 'Pieve' of San Gimignano, but in the second edition (1568) he referred only to New Testament scenes in that church, dating them to the very end of Barna's life, apparently to 1381. According to Vasari's brief but vivid life of 'Berna, painter of Siena', the artist was killed in a fall from the scaffolding while painting them."
264,BARNABA DA MODENA,(active 1361-1383),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barnaba/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Although a native of Modena (Emilia), he was first recorded as a Genoese citizen, hiring Tuscan assistants in 1361 and 1362. He was paid for paintings for the Palazzo Ducale, Genoa, in 1364; a Virgin and Child (1367; Frankfurt am Main, Städelsches Kunstinstitut). His earliest certain painting is the damaged polyptych of the Virgin and Child with Saints (Genoa, Palazzo Bianco), signed, unlike later works, in capital letters. Its frame awkwardly combines the light Gothic arcading of Tuscan polyptychs with the continuous contour and simple gables of Emilian design. The incongruities of figure scale, the blackish undertone to the flesh painting and the small features and tall cranium of the Child all derive from Venetian painting, while the careful modelling of Mary's eyes and puckered lips show the influence of the Lorenzetti brothers and their Sienese followers. Another Virgin and Child (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts) by Barnaba reflects Sienese painting in its rounded faces and gold-striated highlights on Mary's mantle. His small Virgin and Crucifixion (Modena, Galleria & Museo Estense) and the St Bartholomew altarpiece (Genoa, S. Bartolomeo del Fossato), with simple architectural settings, brilliant colours and delicate goldwork, are probably from the 1360s."
265,"BARÓ, Berthomeu",(documented 1467-1481 in Valencia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baro/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active in Valencia where he was documented in 1467 and 1468, charged for some minor work done for the cathedral. All we know of him, thanks to a few documentary references, is that he was of Valencian origin and developed his career on the east coast of Spain."
266,"BAROCCI, Federico Fiori","(b. 1526, Urbino, d. 1612, Urbino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barocci/biograph.html,"Barocci was born in Urbino and apart from two trips to Rome early in his career was based there all his life. Barocci acted as the linchpin that joined the great masters of the sixteenth century with the new art, from Carracci to Guido Reni, that was to emerge in the next century. Barocci trained in his native Urbino with its incredible artistic legacy. He seems to have been particularly conscious of Raphael's contribution to his own style. From his earliest work he incorporated Correggio's sunny grace enriched with his personal and warm taste for Venetian colour. After an unhappy stay in Rome he returned to Urbino for good (1565). He is said to have abandoned his frescos in the Casino of Pius IV in the Vatican Gardens (1561-63) for fear that rivals were trying to poison him, and the hypersensitive temperament this suggests comes out in his work.

"
267,"BAROIS, François","(b. 1656, Paris, d. 1726, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barois/biograph.html,"
French sculptor to Louis XIV. He studied at the Royal Academy, Paris and the French Academy, Rome. While residing at the French Academy he produced a copy of the Callipygian Venus for King Louis XIV of France, working on it from 1683 to 1686. From 1686 to 1709 Barois worked for the Bâtiments du Roi."
268,"BARON, Bernard","(b. 1696, Paris, d. 1762, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baron/biograph.html,"
French engraver active in England. He was the pupil and son-in-law of Nicolas-Henry Tardieu. In 1712 the French engraver Claude Du Bosc (active c. 1711-1740) brought Baron to London to assist with the engraving of murals at Marlborough House. In 1724 Baron engraved eight plates of the Life of Achilles after Rubens. Five years later he returned to Paris where he engraved L'Accord parfait, the first of his four prints for the celebrated Recueil Jullienne collection of the works of Antoine Watteau. Two of the other Watteau paintings that he engraved belonged to the painter's English physician Dr Richard Mead and the fourth, Les Deux Cousines, Baron owned himself. A drawing by Watteau of an engraver at work (British Museum, London) is believed to depict Baron."
269,"BARONCELLI, Niccolò","(active 1434, d. 1453, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baroncel/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and bronze-caster, born in Florence. According to Vasari, he was a disciple of Filippo Brunelleschi. He is first mentioned on 27 April 1434 as having completed a large wooden Crucifix (destroyed) for Santa Margarita, Vigonza (Padua). In 1436 he was commissioned to make the monument to the Santasofia Family (destroyed) in the Eremitani, Padua. This comprised statues of 10 professors, the recumbent effigy of Galeazzo Santasofia, 12 statues of pupils and four unspecified statues. On 12 July 1440 the Confraternità dei Fabbri e Maniscalchi commissioned an altarpiece (completed 1442) for their altar in San Clemente, Padua, from which survives a terracotta relief of the Miracle of St Aegidius (Museo Civico, Padua)."
270,"BARONZIO, Giovanni","(documented 1343-45, d. ca. 1362, Rimini)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baronzio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. There is a confusion in the literature regarding this painter. He is probably identical with the anonymous Trecento painters Master of the Parry Adoration, Master of Santa Colomba, Master of the Life of Saint John the Baptist, and Pseudo-Baronzio. But Giovanni da Rimini seems to be a different contemporary painter active in Rimini."
271,"BAROVIER, Angelo","(b. ca. 1400, Murano, d. 1460, Murano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barovier/biograph.html,"
Italian glassmaker, part of a family of glassmakers. The family are recorded as working in Murano, Venice, as early as 1324, when Jacobello Barovier and his sons Antonio Barovier and Bartolomeo Barovier (c. 1315-c. 1380) were working there as glassmakers. The line of descent through Viviano Barovier (c. 1345-1399) to Jacobo Barovier (c. 1380-1457) led to the more noteworthy Barovier family members of the Renaissance."
272,"BARRA, Didier","(b. 1590, Metz, d. 1644, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barra/biograph.html,"
It is only in recent years that the mysterious painter called ""Monsù Desiderio"" has been separated into two artists who collaborated: Didier Barra and François de Nomé (1593-1644), both from Metz, Lorraine. Didier Barra usually painted topographical views, chiefly of Naples. François de Nomé was the more adventurous of the two, concentrating on the bizarre. Both painters spent their entire careers in Naples  but never assimilated any local influences; they both retained a form of archaising mannerism of a similar type to that of Claude Deruet. At their best, François de Nomé's pictures excite by their power of expression, even though they seem flagrantly to disobey almost every rule of art.



"
273,"BARRAUD, William","(b. 1810, Lambeth, d. 1850, Kensington)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barraud/biograph.html,"
English painter. His family was of French Huguenot origin that had come over to England at the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His younger brother Henry Barraud (1811-1874) was also a notable painter."
274,"BARRE, Jean-Jacques","(b. 1793, Paris, d. 1855, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barre/father/biograph.html,"
French medallist, the general engraver at the Monnaie de Paris between 1842 and 1855. In this position, he engraved and designed French medals, bank notes and postage stamps. He is named ""Jean-Jacques Barre"" in numismatic publications and ""Jacques-Jean Barre"" in philatelic ones. From the late 1840's until 1855, he created the first two French postage stamp designs: the Ceres series and Napoleon III series."
275,"BARRE, Jean-August","(b. 1811, Paris, d. 1896, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barre/son/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and medallist. After training with his father the medallist Jean-Jacques Barré and with Jean-Pierre Cortot, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1826. He was one of the few 19th-century French sculptors who pursued a successful official career without having competed for the Prix de Rome. He was principally a portrait sculptor and exhibited at the Salon from 1831 to 1886, initially showing medals and medallions such as the series of the Orléans Family (Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs). With Jean-Etienne Chaponnière he was one of the first French sculptors to produce miniature portraits of eminent contemporaries in plaster, biscuit or bronze editions for broad popular circulation, showing figures ranging from Queen Victoria to the dancer Marie Taglioni (both 1837; e.g. in bronze, Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs)."
276,"BARRERA, Francisco","(b. 1595, Madrid, d. 1658, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barrera/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Although he is sometimes thought to have been a Sevillian painter, his career is documented in Madrid. Barrera enjoyed considerable prestige and authority within the artistic community of the Spanish capital and in 1634 and 1639 represented his profession in significant legal battles concerning the status and rights of painters. However, Barrera's known paintings, all of which are still-lifes, are those of a derivative artist of modest abilities. In Still-life with Basket of Grapes, signed and dated 1642 (Florence, Uffizi), his arrangement of objects in a window-frame and on a stone ledge derives from works by Juan van der Hamen y León but without that artist's refined compositional sense or mastery of pictorial space. The rather weak modelling of objects in this painting is consistent with Barrera's other still-lifes, which are further characterized by their light tonality, bland colouring and monotonous brushwork. Comparable stylistic features are found in the more accomplished still-lifes of Antonio Ponce, with whom Barrera is documented in the 1630s."
277,"BARRET, George","(b. ca. 1728, Dublin, d. 1784, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barret/biograph.html,"
Irish painter. The son of a tailor, he first trained as a staymaker but then found work colouring prints for Silcock, a publisher in Dublin. In 1747 he was awarded first prize at the Dublin Society's School, where he studied under Robert West."
278,"BARRIAS, Louis-Ernest","(b. 1841, Paris, d. 1905, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barrias/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, brother of Félix Barrias (1822-1907), a painter and illustrator. He began his artistic training as a painter under Léon Cogniet but moved on to study sculpture under Pierre-Jules Cavelier. He enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1858, where he was a pupil of François Jouffroy, and he won the Prix de Rome in 1864. In the meantime he had been involved in the sculptural decoration of the Paris Opéra and had executed a marble statue of Virgil (1865; in situ) on the staircase of the Hôtel de la Paiva in the Champs Elysées."
279,"BARRIÈRE, Dominique","(b. ca. 1618, Marseille, d. 1678, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barriere/biograph.html,"
French etcher, active in Rome. He spent most of his career in Rome, where he engraved a considerable number of plates, after Claude and other landscape painters, as well as other subjects. They are neatly etched in the manner of Stefano della Bella."
280,"BARRY, Sir Charles","(b. 1795, London, d. 1860, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barry/biograph.html,"
English architect, one of the architects of the Gothic Revival in England and chief architect of the British Houses of Parliament."
281,"BARTHEL, Melchior","(b. 1625, Dresden, d. 1672, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barthel/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, ivory-carver and master builder. He probably started his training with his father, the sculptor Hieronymus Barthel (active 1625-c. 1640), and completed his apprenticeship (1640-45) with Johann Boehme (d. 1667). There are records of various journeys he made to Augsburg, Ulm, Venice and Rome."
282,"BARTHOLOMÉ, Albert","(b. 1848, Thiverval-Grignon, d. 1928, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartholo/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter. He studied law and fought in the Franco-Prussian war before attending the École des Beaus-Arts in Geneva. He was originally a painter, working alone in a naturalistic manner heavily influenced by Jules Bastien-Lepage, with his insistence on working in the open air rather than in the studio. He turned to sculpture after the death of his wife, realizing his tomb. He is best known for the Monument aux morts in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise in Paris."
283,"BARTLETT, Paul Wayland","(b. 1865, New Haven, d. 1925, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartlett/biograph.html,"
American sculptor, son of Truman Howe Bartlett, a sculptor and art critic. Although Paul Bartlett was born in the United States he may well be considered a French sculptor since he spent the greater part of his life in Paris. He lived in Paris in his boyhood and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and under Frémiet. The Bohemian Bear Trainer won a gold medal at the Salon of 1888. Of his other works, The Ghost Dance is at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; the equestrian statue of Lafayette is in Paris and a replica is in Hartford, Conn.; Columbus, Michelangelo, and Law are in the Library of Congress. The bronze statue of Robert Morris (Philadelphia) was unveiled after the sculptor's death."
284,"BARTOLINI, Lorenzo","(b. 1777, Savignano, d. 1850, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolin/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and draughtsman. He was one of the most independent-minded sculptors in Italy in the generation after Antonio Canova. His early work is in the Neoclassical style predominant throughout Europe around the turn of the century. While in the Paris studio of Jacques-Louis David he became interested in the art of the Quattrocento, an interest confirmed when he settled in Florence after 1815. His later works combine Neoclassical and neo-Renaissance elements with, particularly in his portraits, a strong taste for naturalism."
285,BARTOLINO da Novara,"(d. ca. 1410, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolix/biograph.html,"
Italian military architect and engineer, son of the master Giovanni da Novara. He is first mentioned in 1368 when Niccolò II d'Este temporarily sent him to Mantua to his ally Guido Gonzaga for certain works. Other documents mention him in 1373-76 as favoured by Alberto, the successor of Niccolò II in Ferrara. Between 1385 and 1387 he was commissioned to build the Castello Estense in Ferrara, which he built on a square plan with corner towers, the traditional type of the era. Always in Ferrara, in 1392 repaired the tribune of the church of St. Francis where he also built a chapel for himself, at his own expense, and one for Alberto d'Este. In 1395 he was invited to the court of Francesco Gonzaga in Mantua where he made designs for the castle, and at the beginning of the fifteenth century participated in several major architectural projects."
286,BARTOLO DI FREDI,"(b. ca. 1330, Siena, d. ca. 1410, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolo/biograph.html,"
Sienese painter, pupil of Ambrogio Lorenzetti. His best two fresco cycles are at S. Gimignano, one dealing with Old Testament subjects in the Collegiata (1356) and one in the church of S. Agostino on the birth and death of the Virgin (1366)."

288,BARTOLOMEO DI FRUOSINO,"(b. ca. 1366, Firenze, d. 1441, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolom/fruosino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. In 1394 he was among the pupils of Agnolo Gaddi working on the decoration of the chapel of the Sacro Cingolo in Prato Cathedral. In the same year he joined the Compagnia dei Pittori in Florence, and between 1386 and 1408 he appears to have been a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali there. From 1402 to 1438 he is mentioned at regular and frequent intervals in the account books of Santa Maria Nuova, for which he executed numerous commissions and from which he rented the house he shared with his brother, Giovanni di Fruosino, a sculptor and perhaps also a painter. In 1411 he was commissioned to paint a Crucifix for Santa Maria Nuova, Florence (Accademia, Florence).



"
289,BARTOLOMEO DELLA GATTA,"(b. 1448, Firenze, d. 1502, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolom/gatta/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, illuminator and architect (original name: Pietro di Antonio Dei). The son of a goldsmith, he was enrolled in the Florentine goldsmiths' guild at the age of five. Later he must have frequented the workshops of Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo and, particularly, that of Andrea Verrocchio, where the major artists of his generation, such as Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Leonardo da Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi, Perugino and Signorelli, used to meet. He probably also had contacts with artists in Arezzo, especially Piero della Francesca, and in Urbino, where Melozzo da Forli, Donato Bramante, Justus of Ghent and Pedro Berruguete worked. Early links with Urbino are also suggested by his friendship, noted by Vasari, with Gentile de' Becchi of Urbino (later Bishop of Arezzo) and by a miniature of the Martyrdom of St Agatha, definitely by his hand, in gradual D of Urbino Cathedral (Cathedral archive)."
290,BARTOLOMEO DI GIOVANNI,(active 1480-1510 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolom/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter known also as Alunno di Domenico (Pupil of Domenico). This name was invented by Bernard Berenson for the Florentine painter to whom he ascribed most of the designs for Florentine woodcut book-illustrations of the late 15th century. This wholesale attribution has not won general acceptance, but the actual pupil and assistant of Domenico Ghirlandaio postulated by Berenson has been identified as Bartolomeo di Giovanni, who was commissioned to paint the predella of Ghirlandaio's Adoration of the Magi in the Spedale degli Innocenti (Foundling Hospital) in Florence, in 1488. He was most important and talented artist in Ghirlandaio's workshop, who had made an individual and pleasing impression in the fresco of the Sistine Chapel. He has an intense, almost biting Nordic style, and he anticipates the rapid and nervous manner of Piero di Cosimo."
291,BARTOLOMEO VENETO,"(active 1502, d. 1531, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartolom/veneto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He worked in Venice, the Veneto and Lombardy in the early decades of the 16th century. Knowledge of him is based largely on the signatures, dates and inscriptions on his works. His early paintings are small devotional pictures; later he became a fashionable portraitist."
292,"BARTOLOZZI, Francesco","(b. 1727, Firenze, d. 1815, Lisboa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartoloz/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver. He was the son of Gaetano Bartolozzi, a goldsmith, with whom he trained before entering the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. There he studied under Giovanni Domenico Ferretti and Ignazio Hugford. In Florence he studied drawing and painting and formed a lifelong friendship with Cipriani, most of whose plates he later engraved. He is said to have become an adept painter of miniatures, watercolours and pastels, and an accomplished draughtsman; but he soon concentrated on engraving."
293,"BARTSIUS, Willem","(b. ca. 1612, Enkhuize, d. after 1639, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bartsius/biograph.html,"
Willem Bartsius (also spelt Bartius, Baldeus and Baldesius), Dutch painter. His father, Paulus Pietersz. Bartsius, was a stadpensionaris, or legal adviser to the town council of Enkhuizen and his sister, Aagje married the landscape and figure painter Pieter Simonsz. Potter and gave birth to the famous animal painter Paulus Potter."
294,"BARYE, Antoine-Louis","(b. 1796, Paris, d. 1875, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barye/father/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, painter and printmaker, celebrated for his portrayal of animals. He laid the basis of his extensive knowledge of animal forms while employed by a goldsmith making models of animals in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris (1823-31). His work was in the spirit of Romanticism, particularly his preference for rendering violent movement and tense posture. He also did the pediment Napoleon dominating History and the Arts on the Pavilion de l'Horloge of the Louvre and an equestrian statue of Napoleon at Ajaccio, the Emperor's birthplace in Corsica."
295,"BARYE, Alfred","(b. 1839, Paris, d. 1882, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/barye/son/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, the son of Antoine-Louis Barye. He was an accomplished artist and sculptor in his own right but for his entire career he worked in the shadow of his much better known and more famous father. Alfred apprenticed under the tutelage of his father and expertly learned the art of bronze sand casting at a very young age while working along side his brothers in his father's studio and foundry. Many of his earliest works, done as a young man, are small casts of wild animals which show the strong influence and teachings of his father. His most successful and numerous subjects were the racehorses of the day but he is known to have modeled many works in the style of his father as well as in a style that is typically his own."
296,"BASAITI, Marco",(c. 1470-1530),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/basaiti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of Albanian origin. He is documented only once, in 1530, when he was recorded in the Mariegola dei Pittori Veneziani (the Venetian painters' guild) as a painter of figures, but many of his paintings are dated, the earliest in 1496 and the last in 1527. The spelling of his signature varies, and Vasari erroneously believed that two Venetian painters existed, named Marco Bassarini and Marco Bassiti. Ridolfi stated that Basaiti was born in Friuli, while Lanzi asserted that Basaiti was born of Greek parents in Friuli. Babinger convincingly proposed that Basaiti was of Albanian origin; a family of Balkan mercenaries in Venetian pay named Bòzhajt or Bòzhejt was documented in Venice at the beginning of the 16th century. This would explain the variations on Basaiti's name and also account for his lack of documentation, since Albanian, Greek and Dalmatian communities living in Venice kept to their own laws and usually do not appear in Venetian documents."
297,"BASCHENIS, Evaristo","(b. 1617, Bergamo, d. 1677, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bascheni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the most prominent of a family of artists recorded from 1400. He was ordained c. 1647 and painted a few religious subjects, but his fame rests chiefly on his beautifully poised and polished still-lifes of muscial instruments. His predilection for the subject may have been associated with the contemporary fame of the Amati family of violin-makers of Cremona, which is near to Baschenis's native town of Bergamo. The Accademia Carrara there has the best collection of his paintings.

Ferrer Bassa (c.1285/90-1348) was Spanish painter and miniaturist who worked for the Aragon court. He is considered the founder of the Catalan School, but the only certain surviving work by his hand is a series of frescos in the chapel of S. Miguel at the convent of Pedralbes near Barcelona, executed in 1345-46 and strongly Italianate in style. Bassa's style was fully developed by his own son, Arnau, and by Ramón Destorrents.

He worked in the Venetian studio of the family under Francesco, his elder brother who ran the Venetian branch of the workshop. Francesco committed suicide a few months after his father's death, then Leandro took over the workshop. He was the chief portrait painter of the family, and his portraits are closely allied to those of Tintoretto. Leandro both acquired some distinction and popularity working in Venice, he was knighted by the Doge in 1595 or 1596 (thereafter he sometimes added 'Eques' to his signature).



"
303,"BASSEN, Bartholomeus van","(b. ca. 1590, Den Haag, d. 1652, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bassen/biograph.html,"
Van Bassen was an architect to the courts of Orange and Bohemia, he had a reputation as one of the most important architectural painter of the first half of the seventeenth century. Nothing is known about his training. The first known document related to him is his registration with the Guild of St Luke in Delft in 1613. By 1624 he was a member of the guild at The Hague, of which he became dean in 1627 and headman twice, in 1636 and 1640. He married Aaltgen Pietersdr van Gilst at The Hague in 1624. From 1629 until 1634 he was occupied with commissions from the stadholder Frederick Hendrick for the Honselaarsdijk and Ter Nieuburch palaces near The Hague. In 1630-31 he worked as the principal architect on the rebuilding of the monastery of St Agnes in Rhenen as a residence for Frederick V, Elector Palatine and king of Bohemia, and his wife, Elizabeth Stuart. Van Bassen was also involved in a number of architectural projects at The Hague and elsewhere."
304,"BASSETTI, Marcantonio","(b. 1588, Verona, d. 1630, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bassetti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Felice Brusasorci, but he soon moved to Venice, where he studied the art of Jacopo Tintoretto in particular, but also that of Jacopo Bassano and of Veronese, whose works he copied in chiaroscuro drawings (mainly Windsor Castle, Royal Library) similar to those of Domenico Tintoretto. Bassetti's early painted Portrait of a Man with a Glove (Verona, Castelvecchio) is essentially Venetian, close to the art of Bassano; his St Peter and St Andrew (both Moruri, S Zeno), both unrefined, rustic works, are similar in style and must also be rare examples of his early paintings."
305,"BAST, Pieter","(b. ca. 1550, Antwerpen, d. 1605, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bast/biograph.html,"
Dutch cartographer, engraver and draftsman. He was the child of Josyntje Plantin, who was part of the famous printer Plantin family."
306,"BASTIANI, Lazzaro","(b. ca. 1430, Venezia, d. ca. 1512, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bastiani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice. In his early maturity, Bastiani can be described as close to the manner of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea del Castagno. Subsequently, his painting moved nearer to that of Gentile Bellini, albeit in a more archaising taste, as may be observed in the almost rigid figures and the strictly defined and delimited spaces.



"
307,"BASTIEN-LEPAGE, Jules","(b. 1848, Damvillers, Meuse, d. 1884, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bastien/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker, and sculptor. Bastien-Lepage grew up on a farm. Although his earliest efforts in drawing were encouraged, his parents violently objected when he decided to become a professional artist. To mollify them he worked for a time as a postal clerk in Paris while studying at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1868 he left the civil service and was accepted into Alexandre Cabanel's atelier. During this apprenticeship, Bastien-Lepage won two prizes in drawing, and in 1870 he made his début at the Salon with a Portrait of a Young Man (untraced)."

French architect. He renovated the Hôtel de Beauharnais for Eugène de Beauharnais (1781-1824), prince of the French First Empire, and viceroy of Italy for Napoleon I, who was his stepfather (from 1796) and adoptive father (from 1806). No other biographical data are available.



"
309,"BATAILLE, Nicolas",(c. 1330-c. 1405),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bataille/biograph.html,"
Nicolas (Colin) Bataille, French tapestry-weaver and dealer. He was one of the most successful of several French luxury textile merchants based mainly in Paris and Arras during the late 14th century and the only one whose work is known to have survived. He was a citizen of Paris and is referred to variously as a weaver of high-warp tapestries and a merchant. His second wife, Marguerite de Verdun, who came from a family of weavers in Troyes, continued his business after his death with his son Jean (b. ca. 1371)."
310,"BATONI, Pompeo","(b. 1708, Lucca, d. 1787, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/batoni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the last great Italian personality in the history of painting at Rome. He carried out prestigious church commissions and painted numerous fine mythological canvases, many for eminent foreign patrons, but he is famous above all as a portraitist. After Mengs left Rome for Madrid in 1761 his preeminence in this field was unchallenged, and he was particularly favoured by foreign visitors making the Grand Tour (an extensive journey to the Continent), whom he often portrayed in an antique setting."
311,"BATTAGGIO, Giovanni di Domenico",(active 1465-1499 in Lombardy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/battaggi/biograph.html,"
Giovanni di Domenico Battaggio (also Battagio da Lodi), Italian master builder and architect. During 1465 and 1466 his name appears in the wages book of the Ospedale Maggiore of Lodi, for which he produced doors, oculi and windows in terracotta. In 1479 he was appointed engineer of the city of Milan, and in 1489 he is mentioned as ducal engineer. He worked on the fortifications at Biasca in 1481. In 1484 Conte Manfredo Landi III (d. 1491) commissioned Battaggio and Agostino Fonduli to finish and decorate the façade of his palazzo in Piacenza (now the Palazzo dei Tribunali)."
312,"BATTEM, Gerrit van","(b. ca. 1636, Rotterdam, d. 1684, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/battem/biograph.html,"
Dutch draughtsman, etcher and painter. He is usually judged by his many signed - and often highly coloured - gouache drawings of landscape views and genre scenes. However, several gouache drawings of religious subjects, for example the Crucifixion (Cleveland, OH, Museum of Art), have been suggested as early works. Between 1648 and 1654 he was very likely a pupil in Rotterdam of Abraham Furnerius, a relative (on his mother's side)."
313,"BAUGIN, Lubin","(b. ca. 1610, Pithiviers, d. 1663, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baugin/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in Paris. He painted religious works and has earned the nickname ""Le Petit Guide"" (Little Guido) because he was strongly influenced by Guido Reni. This suggests that he visited Italy, but there is no firm evidence. A small group of strikingly austere still-lifes, signed simply ""Baugin"" (examples are in the Louvre), has also been attributed to him, although there is little in common between these pictures and the religious works.



"
314,"BAUM, Paul","(b. 1859, Meissen, d. 1932, San Gimignano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baum/biograph.html,"
German painter and printmaker, almost exclusively of landscapes. He spent his youth in Meißen, where he began an apprenticeship as a flower painter at the porcelain manufacture at the age of 17. He studied at the Academy in Dresden, then in the atelier of the landscape painter Friedrich Preller the Younger (1838-1901), and then under Theodor Hagen (1842-1919) in the Weimar School of Art."
315,"BAUMGARTNER, Johann Wolfgang","(b. 1702, Kufstein, Tyrol, 1761, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baumgart/biograph.html,"
German painter and etcher. He was born in Tyrol and he learned glass painting in Salzburg. He moved to Augsburg and worked as a glass painter. The ceiling painting in the Sanctuary of the Holy Cross of the former Klosters Mountains is considered as his largest and most important work."
316,"BAURSCHEIT, Jan Peter van, the Elder","(b. 1669, Würmersdorf, d. 1728, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/baursche/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, part of a family of sculptors and architects of German origin. He is listed in the 1691 records of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp as a student of Petrus Scheemaekers the Elder, and in 1694-95 he was enrolled in the Guild as a master. His early work included numerous commissions for funerary monuments. For the Paris-van den Bruggen family, he carved the stone figure of St Peter Martyr (signed and dated 1700), which forms part of the series of Dominican saints in the choir of St Pauluskerk, Antwerp, where his marble Virgin of Sorrows (1702) for the monument to Pater Abraham van Greyn is also located. The imposing wall tomb of Pieter Ferdinand Roose, Baron van Boechout has a marble figure of Time flanked by marble relief portrait medallions. The stone monument to the Borckhoven-Pemans family (c. 1708; Antwerp, St Jacobskerk) includes a life-size Ecce homo."
317,"BAYEU Y SUBIAS, Francisco","(b. 1734, Zaragoza, d. 1795, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bayeu/francisc/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He had an eminently successful career, becoming court painter to Charles IV and director of the Academy of San Fernando, but he is now remembered almost solely because he was the brother-in-law of Goya, who spent some time in Bayeu's studio in the 1760s and later painted a memorable portrait of him (Prado, Madrid, 1795). Bayeu painted portraits and also did much decorative work, particularly making cartoons for the royal tapestry factory, where he succeeded Mengs as director in 1777.



"
318,"BAYEU Y SUBIAS, Ramón","(b. 1746, Zaragoza, d. 1793, Aranjuez)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bayeu/ramon/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and etcher. He assisted his brother Francisco and worked with Goya in Zaragoza 1780, both being then influenced by the Rococo art of Tiepolo. In Madrid, the painter brothers Francisco and Ramón had set up shop in 1763 and Goya soon joined their studio, eventually marrying their sister Josefa."
319,"BAZHENOV, Vasily","(b. ca. 1737, Dol'skoye, d. 1799, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bazhenov/biograph.html,"
Russian architect. Bazhenov and his associates Matvey Kazakov (1738-c. 1812) and Ivan Starov were the leading local architects of the Russian Enlightenment, a period dominated by foreign architects (Charles Cameron, Giacomo Quarenghi, Antonio Rinaldi and others)."
320,"BAZILLE, Jean-Frédéric","(b. 1841, Montpellier, d. 1870, Beaune-la-Rolande)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bazille/biograph.html,"
French Impressionist painter who was born into a wealthy family. He became interested in painting after seeing some works of Eugène Delacroix. His family agreed to let him study painting, but only if he also studied medicine. He moved to Paris in 1862 where he met Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Alfred Sisley, was drawn to Impressionist painting, and began taking classes in Charles Gleyre's studio. After failing his medical exam in 1864, he began painting full-time. His close friends included Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Édouard Manet."
321,"BAZZANI, Giuseppe","(b. 1690, Mantova, d. 1769, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bazzani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the son of the goldsmith Giovanni Bazzani and trained in the studio of Giovanni Canti (1653-1715). Giuseppe was a refined and cultivated artist and as a young man profited from the rich collections of art in Mantua, studying the works of Andrea Mantegna, Giulio Romano, 16th-century Venetian painters, especially Paolo Veronese, and Flemish artists, above all Rubens."
322,"BAZZANTI, Pietro","(b. 1825, Firenze, d. 1895, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bazzanti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He is associated with the sculptors Cesare Lapini, Ferdinando Vichi (1875-1940) and Guglielmo Pugi, all of whom executed works bearing the inscription: Galleria Bazzanti. The gallery, originally the studio of the sculptor Niccolò Bazzanti, the father of Pietro Bazzanti, was inaugurated in 1822 and is still open today."
323,"BEACH, Thomas","(b. 1738, Milton Abbas, d. 1806, Dorchester)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beach/biograph.html,"
English painter. He studied with Joshua Reynolds from 1760 until early in 1762, during which time he was also a student at the St Martin's Lane Academy, London. He probably settled in Bath; his recorded portraits of the 1760s are all of sitters from Dorset or Somerset, and he sent two portraits from an address in Bath to the Society of Artists exhibition of 1772. He exhibited with the Society until 1783, becoming its vice-president (1782) and president (1783). He also exhibited at the Royal Academy (1785-90, 1797). He probably divided his mature practice between London and Bath."
324,"BEALE, Mary","(b. 1633, Barrow, d. 1699, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beale/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters. She was the daughter of the Rev. John Cradock (?1595-1654), rector of Barrow and an amateur still-life painter. She may have studied painting under Robert Walker. In 1654 she married Charles Beale (1631-1705) who had a keen interest in painting techniques and artists' materials and who had a small but choice art collection. Mary Beale set up a 'paynting room' in their house in Fleet Street, London, where the Beales attracted a lively intellectual circle including Thomas Flatman, the poet and divine Samuel Woodforde, John Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishop Edward Stillingfleet. By 1660 Mary Beale had not only given birth to two sons, Bartholomew and Charles but had already gained some reputation as an artist. At this period she painted the rather rudimentary Beale Family (c. 1662; London, Geffrye Museum), her earliest known work.  Her early influences seem to have included Robert Walker, the Commonwealth portraitist, and the miniaturist Thomas Flatman."
325,"BEATRIZET, Nicolas","(b. 1507, Thionville, d. 1565, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beatrize/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He was probably related to a family of goldsmiths from Nancy, but his working life was spent in Italy. He produced many engravings for publishers in Rome and specialized mostly in reproducing Italian paintings, views of ancient Rome and to a lesser extent portraits. He worked for the engraver and publisher Tommaso Barlacchi in 1541 and 1550, producing Joseph Interpreting Pharaoh's Dreams, the Ascension and Christ Delivering Souls from Limbo after Raphael. He also worked for Antonio Salamanca, for whom he made versions of paintings by Raphael, Michelangelo (e.g. Virgin of Sorrows, 1547) and Baccio Bandinelli (e.g. Struggle between Reason and the Passions, 1545).



"
326,"BEAUBRUN, Charles","(b. 1604, Amboise, d. 1692, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beaubrun/biograph.html,"
Charles Beaubrun (Bobrun), painter, part of a French family of painters. The earliest known member to be associated with the arts was Mathieu Beaubrun I (c. 1525-97), who was a painter and valet de chambre to Henry IV. Two of his sons - the eldest, Mathieu Beaubrun II (d 1608), and the youngest, Henri Beaubrun I - also became painters and valets de chambre to Henry IV, while a third son, Louis Beaubrun (d 1627), became painter to Anne of Austria and then to Louis XIII. The family is principally remembered for two painters in the next generation, Henri Beaubrun II (1603-1677), generally regarded as the son of Henri I, and his first cousin Charles Beaubrun (1604-1692), the eldest son of Mathieu II. Their careers are virtually indistinguishable. Charles's younger brother, Michel Beaubrun (d 1642), was also active as a painter.



"
327,"BEAUFORT, Jacques-Antoine","(b. 1721, Paris, d. 1784, Reuil)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beaufort/biograph.html,"
French painter. He made his public début in 1756 at the newly opened Marseille Académie, where he was listed as a drawing teacher; since nothing is known of his early training, and there is no record of his attempting to enrol at the Académie Royale or to win the Prix de Rome, it seems likely that he studied outside Paris. He did, however, exhibit regularly at the Paris Salon from 1767 to 1783, and he was accepted (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1766 and received (reçu) in 1771, submitting the painting on which his fame was almost entirely to rest, the Oath of Brutus to Avenge Lucretia (exhibited Salon 1771; Nevers, Musée Municipal). This work played a central role in the development of history painting between the British and French examples of the 1760s and Jacques-Louis David's Oath of the Horatii of 1784 (Paris, Louvre), breaking new ground with its simple, meaningful gestures and architectural setting, although the picturesque costumes and the lack of dramatic focus look back to Rococo taste. While owing something to Gavin Hamilton's Oath of Brutus of 1762-3 (New Haven,Yale Center of British Art), popularized by Domenico Cunego's engraving of 1768, Beaufort's Oath is more virile and direct, emphasizing a heroic resolve to seek revenge and providing David, who drew Beaufort's version in his Versailles sketchbook, with the motif of three arms and hands outstretched to take the oath.



"
328,"BEAUGRANT, Guyot de","(b. ca. 1500, Lorraine, d. 1549, Elvillar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beaugran/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish sculptor and architect. He first established his reputation in Flanders, where he worked for the Governor of Spanish Netherlands, Margaret of Austria (1480-1530), and executed the important chimney in Bruges celebrating the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. As an architect, he built for Margaret of Austria her home, the Savoy Court in Mechelen."
329,"BEAUMONT, Claudio Francesco","(b. 1694, Torino, d. 1766, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beaumont/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of French descent. After a visit to Bologna in 1716, he was sent by Vittorio Amadeo II of Savoy, King of Sicily, to study in Rome (1716-19), where he trained with Francesco Trevisani. Between 1719 and 1723 Beaumont was given various important commissions in Turin, including that for the ceiling painting of Aurora's Chariot (1720) on the second floor of the Palazzo Reale. Around this time he was elected prior of the Confraternità di San Luca, and between 1723 and 1731 he was again in Rome. Vittorio Amadeo II recommended him to Nicolas Vleughels, the director of the Académie de France in Rome, and Beaumont was much influenced by the Roman-French style of Trevisani, Carle van Loo and Charles-Joseph Natoire."
330,"BEAUNEVEU, André","(b. ca. 1330, Valenciennes, d. 1402, Bourges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beauneve/biograph.html,"

French sculptor and illuminator from Valenciennes, who worked for the French court, Louis de Mâle, Count of Flanders, and the Duc de Berry. Four of the royal effigies in Saint-Denis came from his workshop (Philip VI, John II, Charles V and his queen). The only illuminations certainly by him are the Prophets and Apostles of the Duc de Berry's Psalter (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, 1380-85). Beauneveu's style in sculpture and painting looked forward to the general northern European trend towards naturalism in the 15th century.



"
331,"BEAUVARLET, Jacques-Firmin","(b. 1731, Abbeville, d. 1797, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beauvarl/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He went to Paris when young, and was instructed in the art by Charles Dupuis and Laurent Cars. He married, in 1761, Catherine Jeanne Françoise Deschamps, an engraver who died in 1769 at the age of thirty-one. He married again in 1770, but became for a second time a widower in 1779. Eight years later, in 1787, he married Marie Catherine Riollet, who, like his first wife, was an engraver."
332,"BEAUX, Cecilia","(b. 1855, Philadelphia, d. 1942, Gloucester)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beaux/biograph.html,"
American painter. She began her career painting on porcelain and producing lithographs and portrait drawings. She studied with Catharine Ann Drinker (1871), Francis Adolf van der Wielen (1872-73) and Camille Piton (1879), at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1877-78), and privately with William Sartain (1881-83). Under Sartain's guidance, she learnt to paint, producing her first major portrait, the Last Days of Infancy (1883-5; private collection). She completed her art training in Paris at the Académie Julian and the Académie Colorossi (1888-89). She had the coaching of painters like Robert-Fleury, Bouguereau and Dagnan Bouveret."
333,"BECCAFUMI, Domenico","(b. ca. 1486, Castel Monaperto, d. 1551, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beccafum/biograph.html,"
Beccafumi, Domenico (1486?-1551), Italian Mannerist painter, who worked in Siena. Originally named Domenico di Pace, and also called Il Mecherino, he took the name Beccafumi from his patron, a wealthy Sienese who sent him to study in Siena and Rome. he was, with Parmigianino, the most interesting of the non-Florentine Mannerist painters, and the last of the great Sienese. A member of the High Renaissance generation, his years in Rome (1510-12) saw the painting of Raphael's Stanze and Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling, both of which influenced him. In such works as the St Catherine Receiving the Stigmata (c. 1515, Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena) he appears also to have been affected by Fra Bartolomeo, whose work was known in Siena. Soon after his return to Siena in 1513 his highly personal style displays characteristics usually associated with the Mannerism of the following decade; his use of strong effects of perspective and contapposto, his intensity of emotion, and his use of subtle, shot colour, as well as of lurid effects of light, are all stylistic features of central Italian painting of the 1530s and 1540s, which he probably knew as a result of the dispersal of Roman artists after the Sack of 1527.

"
334,"BECCARUZZI, Francesco","(b. ca. 1492, Conegliano, d. before 1563, Treviso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beccaruz/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Little of his life is known; most of his documented works were completed in the town of Conegliano, in the province of Treviso. He was probably a pupil of Pordenone, and was also influenced by the painting of Bonifacio de'Pitati, Titian and Jacopo Bassano. "
335,"BECK VON LEOPOLDSDORF, Hieronymus","(b. 1525, d. 1596, Ebreichsdorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beck/biograph.html,"
Austrian nobleman and scholar, son of the Lower Austrian Chancellor Markus Beck. He was brought together with the royal children and studied at the University of Padua. He was the Lower Austrian Kammerrat (1555) and Hofkammerrat (1563). Beck inherited the rule of Niederwaltersdorf (1554) Ebreichsdorf (1572), "
336,"BEECHEY, Sir William","(b. 1753, Burford, d. 1839, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beechey/biograph.html,"
English portrait painter. He was originally meant for a conveyancer, but a strong love for painting induced him to become a pupil at the Royal Academy in 1772. Some of his smaller portraits gained him considerable reputation; he began to be employed by the nobility, and in 1793 became associate of the Royal Academy. He painted many notabilities, including Nelson and Mrs. Siddons. He executed in all 364 portraits."
337,"BEECKMAN, Andries",(active 1651-57 Dutch East Indies),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beeckman/biograph.html,"
Little is known about this Dutch painter, but he seems to have been born in the town of Deventer in the first quarter of the 17th century. A legal document dated, 24th August 1651, relates to some court action involving the painter. It seems evident that shortly after he travelled to the Dutch East Indies. Here he must have executed numerous paintings representing fruits and flowers, together with animals. He must also have executed some landscapes. Other Dutch painters in the 17th century were to travel to these newly discovered lands, which had been established by the early Dutch traders. Here most of the trading was for exotic spices, colour dies and other commodities, and for young artists travelling to these far off lands the plethora of rare and exotic birds, animals, insects, fruits and vegetables must have proved overwhelming."
338,"BEER, Jan de","(b. ca. 1475, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1528, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beer/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman (identical with the Master of the Milan Adoration). He is first mentioned in 1490 in the register of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke, apprenticed to the painter Gillis van Everen (fl 1477-1513). In 1504 de Beer became a master. He subsequently served as alderman of the guild in 1509 and dean in 1515, although he found himself temperamentally unsuited to the position of dean, as is known from a lawsuit he filed in 1519 regarding guild administration. This document also reveals that de Beer participated in the preparations for Charles V's 'Joyous Entry' into Antwerp in 1515 and for the Antwerp Society of Rhetoricians' entry that year in the Malines landjuweel (regional competition of the rhetoricians). In 1510 and 1513 de Beer enrolled apprentices; his son Aert de Beer (c. 1509-before 6 Aug 1540) became an Antwerp master in 1529. The artist is undocumented between 1519 and 1528, by which date he was dead. In 1567 Guicciardini included de Beer in his list of famous Netherlandish painters.



"
339,"BEER, Franz","(b. 1660, Au im Bregenzerwald, d. 1726, Bezau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beer_f/franz/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect from Voralrberg, part of a family of architects active mostly in south Germany and Switzerland. He was one of the most talented of the family. He worked mainly on church buildings at monasteries in southern Germany, chiefly in Upper Swabia, and Switzerland."
340,"BEER, Johann Michael","(b. 1700, Bezau, d. 1767, Bezau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beer_f/johann/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect, part of a family of architects active mostly in south Germany and Switzerland. He was the son of Franz Beer."
341,"BEER, Michael","(b. ca. 1605, Vorarlberg, d. 1666, Bezau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beer_f/michael/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect from Voralrberg, part of a family of architects active mostly in south Germany and Switzerland. He was the first member of the family to come to eminence. He worked at the abbey church of St Lorenz, Kempten, which on plan is a mixture of the longitudinal and centralized type, with a domed octagon set between chancel and nave."
342,"BEERSTRATEN, Jan Abrahamsz.","(b. 1622, Amsterdam, d. 1666, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beerstra/abrahams/biograph.html,"
Beerstraten was the name of two Dutch landscape painters. Anthonie (1639-65) painted mostly snow scenes somewhat similar to those of Hendrick Avercamp; Jan Abrahamsz used more conventional subject matter."
343,"BEERSTRATEN, Anthonie",(active 1635-1665 in Amsterdam),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beerstra/anthonie/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Anthonie Beerstraten is said to have been active as a painter of winter landscapes and sea battles in Amsterdam from 1635-65. Although the relationship between this artist and other members of the Beerstraten painter family is unclear, the name and subject matter suggest that he was part of this family. Anthonie is thought to have used rather harsh colours. To him is attributed a painting signed A. Beerstraten, depicting a Southern Seaport with the Mariakerk of Utrecht (1667; Utrecht, Centraal Museum).



"
344,"BEERT, Osias","(b. ca. 1580, Antwerpen, d. 1624, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beert/elder/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of still-life and flower pieces. In 1596 he went to study with Andries van Baseroo and became a master in Antwerp in 1602. He married Marguerite Ykens on 8 January 1606 and carried on business as a cork merchant. He is specially noted for his paintings of oysters, which show a masterly feeling for colour and texture."
345,"BEERT, Osias the Younger","(b. 1622, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1678, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beert/younger/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Osias Beert the Elder. He was admitted at the Guild of St Luke of Antwerp in 1645. He followed in the steps of his father. His still-lifes present recurring fresh and cooked food as well as table ware on a tilted table-top. The frontal, serialised featuring of the different items enables painter and viewer alike to identify details all the better as each coloured element stands out against a dark, neutral background."
346,"BEEST, Sybrand van","(b. ca. 1610, Den Haag, d. 1674, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beest/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was a pupil of Adriaen van de Venne, and  was influenced by Jan van Goyen. He is known for landscapes with figures in the manner of Isaack van Ostade.


"
347,"BÉFORT, Mathieu","(b. 1813, Paris, d. 1880, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/befort/biograph.html,"
French cabinet-maker, known as Béfort Jeune because he always stamped his work 'Béfort Jeune,' or had the reverse of his bronze mounts stamped BJ. He was the son of Jean-Baptiste Béfort (1783-1840), who was of Belgian origin and renowned for having supplied furniture for the apartments of the Duc d'Orléans. His older brother Bernard Béfort was active between 1836 and 1858, which was the date after which Mathieu took over the business until 1878."
348,"BEGA, Cornelis","(b. ca. 1620, Haarlem, d. 1664, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bega/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman and etcher. He was born into prosperous circumstances; his mother, Maria Cornelis, inherited half the estate (gold, silver, paintings, drawings and prints) and all of the red chalk drawings of her father, Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem, a renowned Mannerist artist. Bega's father was Pieter Jansz. Begijn (d 1648), a gold- and silversmith. Like other family members, Bega was probably Catholic. Houbraken's claim that Bega studied with Adriaen van Ostade is likely to be correct; this was probably before 24 April 1653, when Bega joined Vincent Laurentsz. van der Vinne in Frankfurt for a journey through Germany, Switzerland and France. Bega had returned to Haarlem by 1 September 1654, at which time he joined the Guild of St Luke; he was already a competent draughtsman, as indicated by his first extant dated work, Interior with a Nursing Mother (1652; Frankfurt am Main, Städelsches Kunstinstitut), and by a remarkable double portrait (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) drawn by him and Leendert van der Cooghen in 1654.

"
349,"BEGARELLI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1499, Modena, d. 1565, Modena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/begarell/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. He was the son of a kiln owner, and his formative influences probably included works by the Emilian terracotta sculptors Benedetto degli Erri, Galeotto Pavesi, Guido Mazzoni and Giovanni dell'Abate. He may have trained with Giovanni, and it has been suggested that he was apprenticed to Alfonso Lombardo in Bologna; certainly he was aware of artistic developments in Bologna, Ferrara and Parma."
350,"BEGAS, Carl the Elder","(b. 1794, Hainsberg bei Aachen, d. 1854, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/begas/carl/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a German family of artists. For more than a century, art life in Berlin was influenced by six members of this family: the painter Carl Begas, his four sons and a grandson. The forefathers of the Begas family apparently came from Spain via the Netherlands, and an earlier spelling of their name was Begasse."
351,"BEGAS, Reinhold","(b. 1831, Berlin, d. 1911, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/begas/reinhold/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, member of a family of artists, the son of Carl Begas the Elder. Between 1846 and 1851 he studied at the Königliche Akademie der Künste in Berlin, initially under Johann Gottfried Schadow, and between 1851 and 1853 he continued his training under Ludwig Wichmann and Christian Daniel Rauch. He then began to work independently in Berlin and, after entering his first competition with a Head of Christ, in 1854 he carved the marble group Hagar and Ishmael (plaster version, 1852; Berlin, National Galerie). These were his only sculptures with religious subject-matter, as his work was essentially of and for a humanistic age."
352,"BEGEYN, Abraham Jansz.","(b. 1637, Leiden, d. 1697, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/begeyn/biograph.html,"
Abraham Jansz. Begeyn (also spelt Begein, Begeijn, Begheyn), Dutch painter and draughtsman. In 1655 he became a member of the Guild of St Luke in Leiden. He was registered in Amsterdam in 1672, but the following year, or a little later, he was recorded in London, where he painted at Ham House, Surrey, together with Willem van de Velde the younger and Dirck van den Bergen. In 1681 he was in The Hague, where he had a student called P. Romburch and where two years later he became a member of the painters' confraternity Pictura."
353,"BEHAM, Barthel","(b. 1502, Nürnberg, d. 1540, Italy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beham/barthel/biograph.html,"
German engraver and painter. Together with his brother, Hans Sebald (1500-50), they were expelled from their native city of Nuremberg in 1525 for their extreme Protestant views. Hans settled in Frankfurt and Barthel worked for Duke William IV of Bavaria. Both brothers produced a great number of illustrations to the Bible, mythology, and history, strongly influenced by Dürer. Barthel was also a painter, primarily portraits.


"
354,"BEHAM, Hans Sebald","(b. 1500, Nürnberg, d. 1540, Frankfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beham/hans/biograph.html,"
German engraver who was the most prolific of the Kleinmeister (German: Little Masters) of engraving, so called because they produced small prints.

The Kleinmeister also included Beham's younger brother, Barthel Beham (1502-40), and Georg Pencz (c. 1500-50). All three artists, noted for their brilliant work on extremely small copper plates, grew up under the influence of Albrecht Dürer's late classical style. It is likely that they worked in Dürer's studio. In 1525 the trio was banned from Nürnberg for independent religious views, but not for long. Later Beham moved to Frankfurt am Main. His 252 engravings include biblical and mythological subjects, allegories, genre scenes, and ornaments. Of particular charm were the genre scenes, such as a set entitled Peasant Festival (1537). Some of his woodcuts were of very large size, intended as wall decorations.



"
355,"BEHEIM, Hans the Elder","(b. ca. 1457, Sulzbach, d. 1538, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beheim/biograph.html,"
German architect. In 1488 he was town architect in Sulzbach, Waldsassen, Neumarkt, and Windsheim. From 1499 he worked in Nuremberg, where he was first appointed inspector of buildings to the city. He constructed large utilitarian buildings (granary, weigh-house, toll-house). His public buildings were conspicuous for their size and functional style. Adam Kraft provided stone detail such as coats of arms and other reliefs for many of Beheim's buildings."
356,"BEHNES, William","(b. ca. 1785, London, d. 1864, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/behnes/biograph.html,"
English sculptor of German origin. The son of a Hannoverian piano maker, he was brought up in Dublin, where he worked for his father and attended a public drawing school. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in London in 1813 and set up as a portrait painter shortly afterwards. He began sculpting around 1819 after taking lessons from P. F. Chenu (1760-after 1833) and soon obtained commissions for portrait busts. One of his early sitters was Princess Victoria (marble, 1829; Royal Collection, Windsor Castle), and in 1837 he was appointed Sculptor in Ordinary to the Queen, though he received no further royal commissions."
357,"BEINASCHI, Giovan Battista","(b. 1636, Fossano, nr Turin, d. 1688, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beinasch/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, engraver and draughtsman. He studied with Esprit Grandjean (active 1642-1655), a painter working at the court of Savoy in Turin from 1642, and won the protection of Christina, Duchess of Savoy (1606-1663). By 1652 Beinaschi had settled in Rome. This date appears on the engraving he made of Giovanni Domenico Cerrini's Rest on the Flight into Egypt (untraced). As a pupil of the engraver Pietro del Pò (1610-1692), Beinaschi made copies after Annibale Carracci's frescoes in the Galleria Farnese, Rome, after Giovanni Lanfranco's frescoes in Sant'Andrea della Valle and San Carlo ai Catinari, and after the Classical sculptures in the Belvedere in the Vatican."
358,"BÉLANGER, François-Joseph","(b. 1744, Paris, d. 1818, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belanger/biograph.html,"
French architect and landscape designer. He had a distinguished career as a royal architect at the courts of Louis XV and Louis XVI. Although his fame rests on his accomplishments as a landscape architect, his mercurial talents are perhaps best characterized in his drawings for interior decoration and court festivals."
359,"BELBELLO DA PAVIA, Luchino",(active c. 1430-1470 in Lombardy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belbello/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. He was one of the principal and most distinctive manuscript illuminators active in Lombardy in the mid-15th century. This distinguished miniaturist remained unknown for a long while and scholars only became aware of him in 1915. Yet he was famed in his time throughout northern Italy. He received his training in Lombardy where he was guided by the masters Giovannino de' Grassi and Michelino da Besozzo, and just as much by the miniatures of Franco-Flemish manuscripts which were kept at Castello di Pavia. In 1450 he was convicted of sodomy in Mantua, in his absence."
360,"BÉLIARD, Edouard","(b. 1832, Paris, d. 1902, Étampes)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beliard/biograph.html,"
French painter, son of a Paris architect. He began his career as a lawyer's assistant and secretary. He studied first with Ernest Hébert (1817-1908) and Léon Cogniet (1794-1880). He was influenced by Corot."
361,"BELIN DE FONTENAY, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1653, Caen, d. 1715, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belin/biograph.html,"
Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay (or Jean-Baptiste Blin), French painter, the son of Louis Blin, who may have specialized in flower painting. Early in his life, he had to choose between his religion and his career. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 forced most Protestants to flee France to escape religious persecution. Belin instead decided to renounce his faith and converted to Catholicism in order to continue his work at the court of Louis XIV, king of France. His morceau de réception, the Bust of Louis XIV (Paris, Louvre), is a supremely confident painting. Over 1.8 m high, it shows the bust set on a plinth between two columns, overlooking a vase cascading with flowers, with fruit and armour heaped together below; it brings a new spatial coherence to the genre of the 'table-top' still-life as represented by the work of Jacques Linard, Sébastien Stoskopff and Lubin Baugin."
362,"BELLA, Stefano della","(b. 1610, Firenze, d. 1664, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bella/biograph.html,"
Italian etcher and draughtsman, active also in France under the name Etienne de la Belle from 1640 to 1649. In 1646, he worked briefly in the Netherlands. He was a prolific artist: 1052 prints are described in the catalogue raisonné and thousands of his drawings are in public and private collections. He was one of the greatest Italian etchers, whose prints of battles and sieges, harbours, festivals, plays and operas are filled with tiny figures and vividly suggest many features of 17th-century urban and rural life. Della Bella's landscape etchings were an important influence on the prints of the Lorraine artists François Collignon and Israël Silvestre. His work was overlooked in the 19th century but in the 1960s and 1970s became well known through exhibitions and scholarly publications, distinguishing his work from that of Jacques Callot.


"
363,"BELLANGÉ, Hippolyte","(b. 1800, Paris, d. 1866, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellang/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He was enrolled briefly at the Lycée Bonaparte, Paris, and at 16 he entered the studio of Antoine-Jean Gros, where Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet, Richard Parkes Bonington and Paul Delaroche were also pupils. Influenced by Charlet in particular, in 1817 Bellangé worked as a commercial illustrator, employing the still new process of lithography, notably for the publisher Godefroy Engelmann. Bellangé's independent works can only be traced, however, from 1822 onwards. Between 1823 and 1835 he published 15 albums of lithographs devoted to the patriotic military subjects that had long attracted popular favour, and he turned increasingly to representing them in oil."
364,"BELLANGE, Jacques","(b. 1594, Nancy, d. 1638, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellange/biograph.html,"
French painter, etcher and decorator, active in the Duchy of Lorraine. His reputation now rest on his etchings and drawings, as all his decorative work and almost all his paintings disappeared. His highly individual style represents a last stage of the development of Mannerist art in Europe. Exaggerating the tradition initiated by Parmigianino, he expressed a personal religious mysticism through the artificial conventions of aristocratic elegance.



"
365,"BELLANO, Bartolommeo","(b. 1437, Padova, d. 1496, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellano/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor from the Paduan school. Padua during the fifteenth century possessed a productive and influential, if not very distinguished, school of sculptors. Bellano was the son of a goldsmith and, according to Vasari a pupil of Donatello. Donatello brought bronze art with him to Padua when he moved there from Florence. In 1450, he was entrusted with the realisation of the altar of St Anthony's Basilica, and in order to bring this project to fruition he created a major studio. Bellano was the director of this studio. Although this is undocumented, it may well be true, since shortly after Donatello's return to Florence from Padua in October 1456, Bellano is mentioned in connection with payments for Donatello's bronze statue of Judith Slaying Holofernes (Florence, Palazzo Vecchio). Bellano is documented in Padua again in May 1458 when he, together with Francesco Squarcione, assessed a work of art. Bellano's earliest documented works are four terracotta reliefs with figures of boys, which were commissioned c. 1460 by Antonio Mainardi, one of which can probably be identified (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). Although Bellano's indebtedness to Donatello can be seen in this work, his own figure style is already evident in the powerfully modelled boys' figures."
366,"BELLE, Alexis-Simon","(b. 1674, Paris, d. 1734, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belle/alexis/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a French family of painters. Alexis-Simon Belle was a fashionable portrait painter of the early 18th century, although his reputation is overshadowed by that of his older contemporaries Hyacinthe Rigaud and Nicolas de Largillierre. His son Clément Belle (1722-1806) was a history painter who worked on tapestries for the Gobelins. Clément's son Augustin-Louis Belle (1757-1841) was also a history painter, working in the Neo-classical style."
367,"BELLE, Clément-Louis-Marie-Anne","(b. 1722, Paris, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belle/clement/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of painters, son of Alexis-Simon Belle. He trained with the history painter François Lemoyne and visited Rome. From 1755 he worked for the Gobelins, painting tapestry cartoons adapted from pictures by his contemporaries and from his own designs. In 1759 his altarpiece The Atonement (Paris, St Merri), a work that demonstrates Belle's gifts as a colourist, achieved great success at the Salon. Two years later he was received (reçu) as a history painter by the Académie Royale."
368,"BELLECHOSE, Henri",(active 1415- 1440 in France),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellecho/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter from Brabant, who succeeded Malouel as court painter to the Duke of Burgundy in 1415. He is documented in 1416 as completing an altarpiece left unfinished by Malouel, which can be identified as The Martyrdom of St Denis in the Louvre. The painting appears to be the work of two hands, and the more naturalistic, less elegant parts are given to Bellechose.



"
369,"BELLEGAMBE, Jean","(b. ca. 1470, Douai , d. ca. 1535, Douai)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellegam/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and designer. His father, George Bellegambe, a cabinetmaker and musician, was a prominent citizen of Douai. Jean is first mentioned in a document of 1504, when he is referred to as a master painter, a burgher and married. His teacher is unknown, but his work bears some imprint of the art of Jan Provost, who inherited Simon Marmion’s studio. However, Bellegambe might equally have been apprenticed in Bruges or Brussels (possibly in the atelier of the Master of the Legend of St Mary Magdalen, for example), or even in Antwerp. The calm and serenity of Bellegambe’s compositions, his treatment of landscape, his lightness of technique, his pursuit of clear, soft colours and delicate harmonies all indicate links with the work of Gérard David and Quentin Massys. In the 17th century Bellegambe was known as 'the Master of Colours'.



"
370,"BELLEVOIS, Jacob Adriaensz.","(b. ca. 1620, Rotterdam, d. 1676, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellevoi/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter. His father came from Ghent in Flanders. Jacob Bellevois married in 1643 in Rotterdam; the couple had 4 children, but they lost them all. His wife died in 1652. Bellevois remarried in Rotterdam in 1656. The couple was recorded the same year as living in Gouda. They had 2 boys. His second wife died in 1670. Bellevois was in Gouda again in 1671 and he visited Hamburg in 1673-74."
371,"BELLI, Valerio","(b. ca. 1468, Vicenza, 1546, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belli/biograph.html,"
Italian gem-engraver, goldsmith and medallist. The most important part of his career was spent in Rome, where he worked for Clement VII and his successor Paul III. He also spent a short period in Venice, returning from there to Vicenza in 1530 and remaining in the latter city for most of the time until his death. In Rome he was a well-established member of artistic and literary circles, associating, for example, with Michelangelo and the humanist scholar Pietro Bembo. No specimens of his work as a goldsmith survive, but he is called 'aurifex' in contemporary documents and may have made the settings for his carved gems."
372,"BELLINI, Gentile","(b. ca. 1429, Venezia, d. 1507, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellini/gentile/biograph.html,"
Bellini, Gentile (1429?-1507), Venetian painter, son of Jacopo and (probably elder) brother of Giovanni Bellini. A much honored painter during his lifetime, Gentile was sent by the Venetian state to Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1479 in response to Sultan Muhammad II's request for a good portraitist. Some of his most beautiful works date from his year's sojourn there, including a portrait of the sultan (National Gallery, London) and a watercolor portrait of a boy scribe (Gardner Museum, Boston), which reflects the influence of the Islamic painting style.
"
373,"BELLINI, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1426, Venezia, d. 1516, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellini/giovanni/biograph.html,"
"
374,"BELLINI, Jacopo","(b. ca. 1400, Venezia, d. 1470, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellini/jacopo/biograph.html,"
Bellini, Jacopo (1400?-1470?), Venetian painter, founder of an artistic dynasty that included his sons Gentile and Giovanni Bellini and son-in-law Andrea Mantegna. A tinsmith's son, Jacopo was apprenticed to the celebrated International Gothic painter Gentile da Fabriano and may have accompanied Gentile to Florence in the 1420s. He was certainly at the court of Ferrara in 1441, where he competed with Pisanello in painting the duke's portrait and won.
Most of his career, however, was spent in Venice, where he executed many important paintings for churches, religious confraternities, and the Venetian state. These have all perished, and Jacopo is known as a painter only from a few smaller works. Some, such as The Annunciation (Sant' Alessandro, Brescia) are very lovely, although still closely linked with the Gothic past. More adventurous are the drawings preserved in two notebooks (Louvre, Paris; British Museum, London). These, displaying a range hardly equaled in any contemporary's surviving output, couple the new Renaissance interests of perspective and realistic observation with a vein of narrative and architectural fantasy to astonishing effect. They make understandable Jacopo's position as a progenitor of the Renaissance in North Italy.


"
375,"BELLINI, Leonardo",(active 1443-1490 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellini/leonardo/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and painter, nephew of Jacopo Bellini. A contract of employment dated 23 August 1443, for two years apprenticeship with his maternal uncle Jacopo Bellini, has survived, and it is known that Leonardo lived with him from 1431 and, after the death of his natural father Paolo Remario, adopted Bellini's family name. He is also recorded as having been a witness at legal proceedings in Venice in 1469 and 1479. His known paintings, all mixed media on panel, are the Mocking of Christ (c. 1445-50; Collezione Vittorio Cini, Venice), St Ursula and Four Holy Women (c. 1470; Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice) and Three Scenes from the Life of Drusiana (c. 1480; Schlossmuseum, Berchtesgaden)."
376,"BELLIS, Antonio de","(b. ca. 1616, d. ca. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellis/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He worked primarily in Naples in a formidable naturalistic style deeply influenced by Jusepe de Ribera. His oeuvre was first critically evaluated in the mid-18th century by de Dominici, who included de Bellis among the foremost students of Massimo Stanzione. De Dominici dated de Bellis's best-known work, the incomplete cycle of oil paintings representing scenes from the Life of St Carlo Borromeo (in situ) at San Carlo alle Mortelle, Naples, to the mid-1650s, believing that the work had been left unfinished when the artist died in the plague of 1656. There is, however, no documentary evidence for de Bellis's death in that year, and archival evidence since uncovered by de Vito shows the paintings were commissioned between 1636 and 1638, executed 1636-39 and exhibited in the church in 1640. In light of this, the artist's date of birth of about 1616 has been suggested.



"
377,"BELLO, Marco","(b. 1470, Venezia, d. 1523, Udine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bello/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was one of the most faithful pupils of Giovanni Bellini in reproducing the works of his master starting with the Circumcision of Christ, his only signed work and currently kept in the Concordi Academy in Rovigo."
378,"BELLOTTI, Pietro","(b. 1623, Volciano di Salò, d. 1700, Gargnano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellotti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, who painted mainly portraits and character heads. He worked for Cardinal Mazarin, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (later Pope Alexander VIII). He was in the service of the Gonzaga in Mantua as superintendent of the galleries. He wandered from court to court at Lake Garda and died in poverty in Gargnano."
379,"BELLOTTO, Bernardo","(b. 1720, Venezia, d. 1780, Warszawa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellotto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, nephew, pupil, and assistant of Canaletto (Antonio Canal) in Venice.

"
380,"BELLUCCI, Antonio","(b. 1654, Pieve di Soligo, d. 1726, Pieve di Soligo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bellucci/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active also in Austria, Germany and England. He studied drawing with a nobleman Domenico Difnico in Sebenico (Sibenik) in Dalmatia (now part of Croatia, at that time a Venetian colony) and went to Venice around 1675. His first works were influenced by Pietro Liberi, Andrea Celesti and Antonio Zanchi, as is apparent from the large canvas showing St Lorenzo Giustiniani, first Patriarch of Venice, praying for the city's deliverance from the plague of 1447 (c. 1691; Venice, S Pietro di Castello, choir). In the following years, in response to Veronese, his palette became lighter."
381,"BELVEDERE, Andrea","(b. 1652, Napoli, d. 1732, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/belveder/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Abate Andrea Belvedere. At the start of his career his work was inspired by Paolo Porpora and particularly by the early works of Giuseppe Recco. He excelled in painting still-life paintings of fruit and flowers. He was employed by Charles II of Spain; and in collaboration with Luca Giordano, who painted the figures, he helped to decorate the Escorial.



"
382,"BEMBO, Benedetto",(active 1462-1489 in Cremona),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bembo/benedett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Bonifazio Bembo. Apart from the records of his presence in Cremona in 1464, 1478 and 1489, nothing is known about Benedetto Bembo's life. His major work is the large polyptych of the Virgin and Child between Sts Anthony Abbot, Nicodemus, Catherine of Alexandria and Peter Martyr (Milan, Castello Sforzesco) executed for the chapel of St Nicodemus in the Castello Rossi of Torrechiara, near Parma. It is inscribed Benedictus Bembus ediit MCCCCLXII Mensis Mai and has half-length busts of the Apostles in the predella panel below. The altarpiece is an elaborately carved, old-fashioned gold-backed polyptych. The figures are squat and heavy and Benedetto used layers of glaze to create wrinkled skin textures and drapery folds in a manner typical of Ferrarese painters. The large, heavy-lidded, almost squashed features reappear constantly throughout Benedetto's work. The Torrechiara Polyptych is very different from the earlier Cremonese style as represented by the Cavalcabo Chapel, but a fresco cycle in a small chapel in Monticelli d'Ongina, outside Cremona, which freely copies the figures of the four Evangelists in the Cavalcabo Chapel vault, has been convincingly attributed to Benedetto, along with the frescoes in and around the apse. The figure of the Virgin ascending into heaven on the far wall by the apse is comparable with the Torrechiara Virgin. The scenes from the Life of St Bassiano by the entrance are probably by an assistant."
383,"BEMBO, Bonifazio",(active in Brescia and Cremona 1444-1477),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bembo/bonifazi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Benedetto Bembo. In an undated letter Bonifazio recalled his support for Francesco Sforza's cause in Reggio Emilia and Brescia during the conflict between Milan and Venice in 1447. By 1455 he was in the service of the Sforza family, although the exact nature of his work is not recorded. The following year he was called to Pavia to carry out a number of commissions, including touching up and repainting a hunting fresco dating from the time of the Visconti, the previous rulers of Lombardy, in the castle's great hall. Work was slow and in 1458 the artist was ordered to take on assistants to complete the job more quickly."
384,"BEMBO, Giovan Francesco","(b. ca. 1480, Cremona, d. ca. 1543)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bembo/giovan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, nephew of Bonifazio Bembo. He can be identified with the Giovan Francesco Vetraio mentioned by Vasari in the 1568 edition of the Vite, but very little is known of either his life or his works. He was presumably born in Cremona and trained in a local bottega. According to Vasari, he went to Rome to paint Pope Leo X's coat of arms on the facad of Cardinal Francesco Soderini's palazzo. This must have been done between 1513, the year of Leo X's election, and 1518, when Bembo is documented at Cremona for the decoration of the central nave of the cathedral. He was paid in December 1519 for the Adoration of the Magi and the Presentation in the Temple in the fifth bay on the left. In these frescoes, which form part of the vast cycle already begun by Boccaccio Boccaccino and to which Altobello Melone and Pordenone contributed shortly afterwards, Bembo left his first signature: BEMBUS INCIPIENS."
385,"BENAGLIO, Francesco","(b. ca. 1430, Verona, d. ca. 1492, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benaglio/biograph.html,"
Francesco Benaglio (Benalius), Italian painter, originally Francesco di Pietro della Biada. He adopted his professional name from a noble Bergamask family then living in Verona. His earliest documented work is the signed triptych of the Virgin and Child Enthroned Adored by St Bernard with SS Peter, Paul, Francis, Jerome, Louis of Toulouse and Anthony of Padua (1462; Verona, Castelvecchio), executed for S Bernardino, Verona. It is a relatively free copy after Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece (Verona, San Zeno), although much more decorative in the details and less secure in the spatial arrangement of the saints."
386,"BENCZÚR, Gyula","(b. 1844, Nyíregyháza, d. 1920, Dolány)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benczur/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. After 1851 he studied under Hermann Anschütz (1802-1880), and then between 1855 and 1869, under Karl Piloty. He first scored success in 1867 with the painting László Hunyady's Farewell. In 1870 he won the national competition of history painting with The Baptism of Vajk. He assisted Piloty with the frescoes of Maximilianeum and Rathaus in Munich and he also illustrated books by Schiller. The Bavarian king Ludwig II commissioned him to paint Rococo themes, that was the time that be went on a study trip visiting Italy and France. He was invited to direct the painters schools at Prague and at Weimar, but only accepted the professorship at the Academy of Munich in 1876."
387,"BENDL, Ehregott Bernhard","(b. ca. 1660, Pfarrkirchen, d. 1738, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bendl/biograph.html,"
Ehregott Bernhard Bendl (also Pendl), German sculptor. He was trained initially by his father until 1678. He spent his years on the road as a journeyman (Prague, Vienna, Rome, and Paris). The sculptor Johann Georg Bendl worked in Prague and the sculptor Ignaz Innocent Bendl in Vienna. It is presumed that he was related to both, and was educated in their studios."
388,"BENDZ, Wilhelm","(b. 1804, Odense, d. 1832, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bendz/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He is mainly known for genre works and portraits which often portray his artist colleagues and their daily lives. He was one of the most talented artists in the successful generation of painters who studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg but died early and has therefore left a relatively small oeuvre."

Italian sculptor, active also in England. The son of Bartolommeo de' Grazzini, Benedetto took his name from the town outside Florence where he owned a farm. His earliest known works are a marble singing-gallery of 1499 (Genoa, Santo Stefano) and the figures of Louis, Duke of Orléans, and his wife Valentina Visconti (1502; marble; Paris, St Denis), for the tomb of the Dukes of Orléans, which was commissioned from four artists by Louis XII."
391,"BENEFIAL, Marco","(b. 1684, Roma, d. 1764, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benefial/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draftsman. He was a nonconformist artzist who reacted against the popular late Baroque style and ennobled contemporary Roman painting with humanity and naturalism. In seeking to renew artists' study of nature and to return to the classical tradition of Annibale Carracci and Raphael, Benefial anticipated Neoclassicism. "
392,"BENING, Alexander","(active 1469, Gent, d. 1519, Gent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bening/alexande/biograph.html,"
Alexander (Sanders) Bening, Flemish illuminator, part of a family of illuminators. In 1469 he became a member of the Guild of St Luke and St John in Ghent and paid a deposit on the admission fee; he nominated Hugo van der Goes and Joos van Wassenhove as guarantors for the remainder. Sanders and his family lived in Ghent, but in 1486 he also joined the Bruges Guild of St John and St Luke, whose membership embraced all those concerned with the production of books. He did not, however, pay dues to the Bruges guild annually, indicating that he did not have a permanent workshop in Bruges but only worked there occasionally, probably to execute particular commissions. He travelled to Antwerp on family business in 1514."
393,"BENING, Simon","(b. 1483, Ghent, d. 1561, Bruges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bening/simon/biograph.html,"
Flemish illuminator, part of a family of illuminators, son of Alexander (Sanders) Bening. Simon worked in Bruges and represents one of the final sparks of the tradition of illumination as the manuscript was overtaken by the printed book. He was perhaps the most celebrated illuminator of his time. By 1530 the Portuguese diplomat and humanist Damino de Goes had extolled him as the best craftsman in his line; Francisco de Holanda, also Portuguese, wrote in similar terms two decades later. Simon Bening is mentioned not only by the 16th-century Flemish historians Denis Harduyn and Antonius Sanderus, but also by Vasari and Lodovico Guicciardini."
394,"BENINTENDI, Orsino","(b. ca. 1440, Firenze, d. ca. 1498, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beninten/biograph.html,"
Orsino Benintendi belonged to an Italian family of cerajuoli (wax modellers), named Benintendi. The trade had already been practiced by Orsino's father, Zanobi, and his grandfather, Jacopo. Orsino's son, Antonio, was also a wax modeller."
395,"BENOIST, Marie-Guillemine","(b. 1768, Paris, d. 1826, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benoist/biograph.html,"
French woman painter, née Marie-Guillemine Leroulx-Delaville. She first studied with Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun in 1781 and in 1786 worked in the studio of Jacques-Louis David. In 1784 she met the poet Charles-Albert Demoustier (1760-1801), and the figure of Emilie in his Lettres de la mythologie represents Benoist. She exhibited at the Salon in 1791 (Psyche Taking Leave of her Family) and obtained a gold medal there in 1804. Her reputation as a portrait painter brought her commissions from Napoleon and his family: in 1803 the portrait of the emperor Napoleon (1804; Ghent, Law Courts) for the town of Ghent; in 1805 that of Marshal Brune (destroyed; copy Versailles, Château) for the Tuileries; in 1807 that of Pauline Bonaparte (Versailles, Château). She also executed the portraits of Marie-Elise, Grand Duchess of Tuscany (Lucca, Pinacoteca Nazionale) and the empress Marie-Louise (Fontainebleau, Château)."

Painter, part of a French family of painters, brother of Jean-Achille Benouville. He was a student of Picot at the same time as his brother and entered the École des Beaux-Arts at the age of 16. He exhibited regularly at the Salon from 1838 and won the Prix de Rome in 1845 (the same year as his brother) with his Christ before the Tribunal (Paris, École Nationale Supérieur des Beaux-Arts), the almost violent intensity of expression and realism of which is rare in paintings of this period. In Rome he became interested in Early Christian art, from which he acquired a sense of the monumental without being distracted from his search for realism, as exemplified in Martyrs Led away to their Ordeal (1855; Paris, Louvre)."
398,"BENOUVILLE, Jean-Achille","(b. 1815, Paris, d. 1891, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benouvil/jean/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of painters, brother of François-Léon Benouville. He was a pupil of François-Edouard Picot until he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1837. From 1834 he exhibited at the Salon many landscapes of the surroundings of Paris, Compiègne and Besançon that were sometimes similar to the works of his friend Corot. These landscapes were painted directly from nature and show his considerable sensitivity to variations in light."

Italian painter and draughtsman. Around 1605 he came to Genoa, where he presented himself to a leading patron of the arts, Gian Carlo Doria, who gave him lodging and recommended him to Giovanni Battista Paggi (1554-1627), in whose influential studio he trained. Students were required first to copy sketches, then paintings and reliefs and, finally, to draw from nature. Benso made many copies after a variety of source material, among them the Sacrifice of Abraham (Florence, Uffizi) after Luca Cambiaso and the Joseph Sold into Slavery (Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett) after Raphael. While still with Paggi, Benso produced 'bizarre sketches of great number and variety, as he had a fertile mind along with a lively and vigorous imagination'. In order to learn perspective he constructed architectural models, which were greatly admired; they enabled him to achieve formidable feats of aerial perspective in his paintings, in which figures and ornament are boldly foreshortened."

Ambrosius Benson (Bentsoen), born Ambrogio Benzone, South Netherlandish painter born in Lombardy and active in Bruges. In 1518 he acquired Bruges citizenship, and in 1519 he was admitted to the guild of painters and saddlemakers there as an independent master, with the comment that he was 'from Lombardy'. Initially he worked in the studio of Gerard David, by whom he was profoundly influenced, but after a few months the relationship went wrong and the younger painter brought a case against David."

In 1883 he travelled with his fellow student and lifelong friend Edmund Charles Tarbell to Paris, where they both studied at the Académie Julian for three years with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre."
403,"BENTLEY, Charles","(b. ca. 1805, London, d. 1854, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bentley/biograph.html,"
English painter and engraver. The son of a carpenter in Tottenham Court Road, London, he was apprenticed as an engraver to Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding (1781-1851) and while working for him engraved a number of Richard Parkes Bonington's watercolours. These profoundly influenced his own development, and echoes of Bonington and Copley Fielding (Theodore's brother) can be found in most of his works. He became a close friend of William Callow (1812-1908), with whom he made a number of sketching tours to the Normandy coast and Paris. He also travelled throughout the British Isles."
404,"BENVENUTI, Pietro","(b. 1769, Arezzo, d. 1844, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/benvenu/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In 1781 he began his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, where he was taught by such Neo-classical painters as Giuseppe Piattoli (c. 1743-1823) and Sante Pacini (active 1762-90). He went to Rome in 1792 to continue his studies and while there painted the Martyrdom of St Donatus (1794; Arezzo Cathedral) for Bishop Marcacci of Arezzo. This work was one of his first commissions and shows the influence of Baroque religious art. By the time Marcacci commissioned him to paint Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1803-04; Arezzo Cathedral), his style had developed under the influence of Vincenzo Camuccini and Antonio Canova, artists who dominated the Neo-classical movement in Rome. However, his crisp, linear style of drawing shows a greater affinity to the work of the Danish-German painter Asmus Jakob Carstens than to that of any Italian."

Italian painter, his full name Benvenuto di Giovanni di Meo del Guasta. He was the son of a bricklayer and lived and worked in or near Siena all his life. He is first recorded working as an artist in 1453 when he was painting in the Siena Baptistery, probably with il Vecchietta, who may have been his teacher. In his early years he was also influenced by Matteo di Giovanni, Francesco di Giorgio and Neroccio de' Landi. His style changed considerably in the 1480s. "
406,"BERAIN, Jean the Elder","(b. 1640, Saint-Mihiel, d. 1711, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berain/biograph.html,"
French designer, architect, and engraver. He was born into a family of artists, whose real name was Leclerc, but went under the name of Berain. The Berain family moved to Paris c. 1644. Berain's father, also called Jean Berain, and his uncle Claude Berain were master gunsmiths. From the age of four Jean lived in Paris, where his family all worked as harquebusiers. In 1655 he married the daughter of a shoemaker, who gave him nine children, and was herself a painter."
407,"BÉRAUD, Jean","(b. 1849, St. Petersburg, d. 1935, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beraud/biograph.html,"
French painter, born in St. Petersburg of French parents. His father (also called Jean) was a sculptor and was likely working on the site of St. Isaac's Cathedral at the time of his son's birth. Until the occupation of Paris during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. he studied law in Paris. He then studied art at Léon Bonnat's studio for two years. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon in 1873."
408,"BERCHEM, Nicolaes (Claesz.)","(b. 1620, Haarlem, d. 1683, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berchem/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of pastoral landscapes in the Italianate manner, principally active in Haarlem. He was the son of the still-life painter Pieter Claesz. and it is not known why he adopted a different surname. Claesz. was his first teacher, but although Berchem tried his hand at most subjects, no still-lifes by him are known. He visited Italy in the 1640s and perhaps again in the 1650s and became, with Jan Both, the most highly regarded exponent of the Italianate landscape.

Dutch printmaker belonging to the Berckenrode family of mapmakers (father and two sons). They were, among others, surveyors, mapmakers (drew the maps), 'painters' (large-scale city- and garden-plans and battle plans) and publishers. The father was Floris Balthasar van Berckenrode from Delft, who was also trained as an engraver and goldsmith; his two sons were Balthasar Florisz. van Berckenrode and Frans Florisz. van Berckenrode.

Dutch painter of architectural views, active in Haarlem, Amsterdam, and The Hague. He was the younger brother of Job Adriaensz. Berckheyde His representations of those cities have documentary accuracy, but they are never dry, achieving a poetic harmony by a subtle use of light and shade.

"
412,BERENGUER DE MONTAGUT,(active 2nd half of 14th century in Catalonia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berengue/biograph.html,"
Catalan architect. Little is known about his life. He is currently linked with three religious buildings in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, for which it seems clear that he was the designer and master builder during parts of their respective constructions: Santa Maria de l'Aurora in Manresa (the Manresa Cathedral), Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona and the Cathedral of Majorca. On occasions he has also been linked with the church of Santa Maria del Pi in Barcelona.



"
413,"BERENTZ, Christian","(b. 1658, Hamburg, d. 1722, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berentz/biograph.html,"
German painter. Although born in Hamburg, Berentz was one of a number of artists in the 17th century to make their careers in Rome. Shortly after his arrival in the Eternal City in 1680, Berentz became known to the Marchese Niccolò Maria Pallavicini who invited the artist to live in his palazzo. According to his biographer, Pascoli, Berentz collaborated with Carlo Maratti on a number of paintings when working for the Pallavicini family, including a large still-life with figures, signed and dated 1696, now in the Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples."

Giovanni Battista Castello, Italian painter, architect and sculptor. He is usually called Il Bergamasco after his father's native region to distinguish him from the other painter (of miniatures) with the identical name from the school of Genoa."
415,"BERGEN, Dirk van","(b. ca. 1645, Haarlem, d. ca. 1690, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bergen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was a pupil of Adriaen van de Velde in Amsterdam. He painted idyllic sunny landscapes in golden tones, with cows, shepherds and shepherdesses (e.g. Landscape with Herdsmen and Cattle, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), in which he managed to imitate his master's style deceptively well and sometimes also that of Nicolaes Berchem, whom he followed especially in his drawings (e.g. Cattle and Sheep Reposing in a Landscape, London, British Museum). Many of his paintings survive but only a few are dated, the earliest from 1676. They are mostly in a small format, well made but not very inventive. Sale catalogues indicate that he also depicted scenes from the life of Christ and painted the figures in a landscape by Meindert Hobbema, although this painting cannot be identified.

Flemish painter, active in Middelburg. Little is known about Christoffel van den Berghe's life. His pictures generally bear the monogram CVB, and his identity was unknown until the 1950s. He seems to have led a fairly isolated existence in Middelburg, and only four of his flower paintings have been identified. He registered in the Guild of St. Luke in Middelburg."
419,"BERGHE, Augustin van den","(b. 1756, Brugge, d. 1836, Beauvais)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berghe2/augustin/biograph.html,"

French painter of Flemish origin. He was the son of a successful history painter, Augustin van den Berghe who had left the Austrian Netherlands of his birth to make his career in France, winning the prix de Rome in 1786. Charles, born in France, studied first with his father then Girodet and Gros, and in Rome with Guérin. He was a regular and prolific Salon exhibitor, showing for the first time in 1822, a classical history subject (his first and only) and a series of portraits which proved to be his principal source of income for the rest of his life, winning a 2nd class medal in 1833."

Ambrogio Bergognone (also Borgognone), originally Ambrogio di Stefano da Fossano, Italian painter of the Lombard school whose use of subdued and subtle colours lead Berenson to nickname him the 'Whistler of the Renaissance'. He was a pupil of Foppa, Leonardo had hardly any influence on him. His youthful Madonnas are deeply perceived and are evidence of the naive piousness of their creator. Together with Foppa he is considered to be the greatest painter of the Milanese School. He painted an altarpiece and frescoes for the convent of the Carthusians at Pavia (1514) and frescoes in the church of S. Simpliciano, Milan.

"
425,"BERJON, Antoine","(b. 1754, Lyon, d. 1843, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berjon/biograph.html,"
French painter, teacher and designer. According to his uncorroborated 19th-century biographer J. Gaubin (1856), he was intended for holy orders and began studying flower painting as a novice. Certainly he studied drawing under the sculptor Antoine-Michel Perrache (1726-79) and worked for Lyon's silk industry as a textile designer, visiting Paris annually, ostensibly to keep abreast of the latest fashions. He first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1791 and settled in Paris in about 1794, probably as a consequence of the catastrophic siege and destruction of Lyon by revolutionary forces the previous year. Initially he eked out a precarious living decorating snuff-boxes and painting miniatures, supported by friends such as Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, the poetess, and the miniature painter Jean-Baptiste Augustin, to whom Berjon dedicated The Gift (1797; Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts)."
426,"BERLINGHIERI, Bonaventura",(active in 1230s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berlingh/biograph.html,"
The Berlinghieri were a family of Italian painters active at Lucca in the 13th century. Berlinghiero Berlinghieri, the founder of the family, is called 'Milanese' in a document of 1228, which also mentions three sons, Marco, Barone, and Bonaventura. He is not otherwise known, but a painted Crucifix (now in the Lucca Pinacoteca) signed 'Berlingeri' without Christian name is attributed to him. A Crucifix in the Accademia, Florence, is also sometimes assigned to him.

"
427,"BERMEJO, Bartolomé","(b. ca. 1440, Cordova, d. ca. 1500, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bermejo/biograph.html,"
One of the leading Spanish artists of the last third of the fifteenth century was Bartolomé Bermejo. The signature 'Bartolomeus Vermeio Cordubensis' on the Pietà in Barcelona cathedral, one of his later works, completed in 1490, indicates that he was born in Cordoba. At the same time, there is nothing in the Andalusian art of that period to explain the origin of his style or the source of his technique. It is assumed that Bermejo studied in Flanders, perhaps in direct contact with Dirk Bouts, with whom he has certain stylistic affinities. In spite of this Flemish training, Bermejo's work leaves us in no doubt concerning his Spanish origin. Robust, virile, and dramatic, it is characterized by a profound gravity, the counterpart of the lyrical refinement so typical of the Spanish genius."
428,BERNARD D'AGESCI,"(b. 1756, Niort, d. 1829, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernard/biograph.html,"
French painter, originally Jean-Charles-Henri-Auguste Bernard. His father was a shopkeeper in Niort, a town of considerable importance during the Revolution, located some eighty kilometres west of Poitiers. He was second of the eighteen children of his parents. His first master was Jean Drouart, who died in 1780 on Niort. He went to Paris in 1772 where around 1772 entered the studio of Jean-Bernard Restout (1732-1797), the son of the famous Jean Restout. By 1785 he was documented in Italy."
429,"BERNARD, Émile","(b. 1868, Lille, d. 1941, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernarde/biograph.html,"
French painter and writer, the son of a cloth merchant. Relations with his parents were never harmonious, and in 1884, against his father's wishes, he enrolled as a student at the Atelier Cormon in Paris. There he became a close friend of Louis Anquetin and Toulouse-Lautrec. In suburban views of Asnières, where his parents lived, Bernard experimented with Impressionist and then Pointillist colour theory, in direct opposition to his master's academic teaching; an argument with Fernand Cormon led to his expulsion from the studio in 1886. He made a walking tour of Normandy and Brittany that year, drawn to Gothic architecture and the simplicity of the carved Breton calvaries. In Concarneau he struck up a friendship with Claude-Emile Schuffenecker and met Gauguin briefly in Pont-Aven. During the winter Bernard met van Gogh and frequented the shop of the colour merchant Julien-François Tanguy, where he gained access to the little-known work of Cézanne."
430,"BERNARD, Joseph","(b. 1866, Vienne, Isère, d. 1931, Boulogne-sur-Seine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernardf/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the son of a stone mason and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Lyon before moving to Paris, where between 1892 and 1900 he exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Français works of descriptive realism, frequently tragic in inspiration, such as the life-size Hope Defeated (plaster and marble, 1893; Vienne, Musée des Beaux-Arts). After 1900 he worked towards a greater architectonic rigour and formal purity, as, for example, in the monument to Michel Servet (stone, 1905-11; Vienne, public gardens) and Young Girl with Pitcher (bronze, 1910; Paris, Pompidou), which have similarities with contemporary works by Aristide Maillol."
431,"BERNARDI, Giuseppe","(b. 1694, Pagnano, d. 1774, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernardg/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, nephew and pupil of the sculptor Giuseppe Torretti. Later he took his uncle's surname and inherited his workshop on Torretti's death. (He is known also as Torretto.) He continued to work in Venice though most of his commissions were in other towns in the Veneto and Friuli regions. His major work in Venice is a cycle of Apostles and Evangelists for Santa Maria della Fava (c. 1766). Although he worked along the lines taught him by his uncle and was perhaps influenced by Marchiori, and possibly even Gai, he developed his own distinctive style."

433,BERNARDINO DI MARIOTTO DELLO STAGNO,"(b. ca. 1478, Perugia, d. 1566, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernardi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He worked in both Umbria and the Marches. He was trained in Perugia in the workshop of Ludovico d'Agnolo Mattioli. From 1502 he is documented in Sanseverino, where he took over the workshop of Lorenzo d'Alessandro di Sanseverino. He stayed in Sanseverino until 1521 and then moved to Perugia, where he set up a workshop with Marino d'Antonio Samminuzi. During his stay in Sanseverino he traveled extensively through Umbria and the Marches, developing his style within the artistic boundaries and possibilities of the two regions. His paintings show particularly elements of the work of Carlo Crivelli, whose panels Bernardino must have studied closely.

Italian sculptor. A royal subsidy provided by Charles-Emanuel III of Savoy, King of Sardinia, enabled him to attend the school of Claudio Francesco Beaumont in Turin. Bernero showed an early preference for papier-mâché as a medium, producing papier-mâché works for popular devotional dramas. In 1765 a second royal stipend supported a four-year continuation of his studies in Rome. There he trained with Ignazio Collino, acquiring skill in working more durable materials, such as marble and stone. Collino's classicizing influence was not strong enough, however, to counteract Bernero's apparent preference for Baroque effects, as is demonstrated in his dramatically swooning marble Magdalene (1770; Duomo di Casale), a typically highly charged composition."
435,"BERNINI, Gian Lorenzo","(b. 1598, Napoli, d. 1680, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernini/gianlore/biograph.html,"Italian artist who was perhaps the greatest sculptor of the 17th century and an outstanding architect as well. Bernini created the Baroque style of sculpture and developed it to such an extent that other artists are of only minor importance in a discussion of that style.

"
436,"BERNINI, Luigi","(b. 1612, Roma, d. 1681, ?Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernini/luigi/biograph.html,"
Sculptor and engineer, brother of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. He was first trained in sculpture by his father Pietro Bernini and then by his brother. His earliest work is one of a pair of marble angels for Sant'Agostino, Rome (1628; completed by Giuliano Finelli). He also carved the stemme and Barberini sun on the Barcaccia Fountain (1627-29) in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome, a collaboration with his father and brother."
437,"BERNINI, Pietro","(b. 1562, Sesto Fiorentino, d. 1629, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bernini/pietro/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist sculptor, father of Gian Lorenzo. He enjoyed a peripatetic career in Florence and Naples before moving to Rome in 1605, where he produced a number of sculptures of uneven quality and a decidedly archaic flavour. He knew the works of Giambologna at first hand and collaborated with one of Giambologna's pupil, Giovanni Caccini; this knowledge he passed on to his more gifted son. Pietro's technical expertise was quickly recognized in Rome, for he received prominent commissions in Santa Maria Maggiore, the most memorable being the handsome relief of the Assumption of the Virgin for the sacristy."
438,"BERRECCI, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1480, Pontassieve, d. 1537, Kraków)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berrecci/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, active in Poland. Initially he studied with his father who was also an architect. He was then probably taught by Andrea Ferrucci (1465-c. 1526), his father's fellow Florentine architect. He moved to Poland in 1516 at the invitation of the bishop Jan Laski to take over the work of rebuilding the Wawel Royal Castle in Kraków after the death of Francesco Fiorentino (active 1502-1505). The castle had burnt down in 1499, and the rebuilding was commissioned by Sigismund I of Poland. He also took over Fiorentino's workshop."
439,"BERRUGUETE, Alonso","(b. 1488, Paredes de Nava, d. 1561, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berrugue/alonso/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor and painter, the son of Pedro Berruguete, who became the major Spanish sculptor of the 16th century. He was trained in Italy and brought back Italian Mannerist ideas, both in sculpture and in painting. He went to Florence about 1504, where he saw and copied Michelangelo's lost cartoon for the Battle of Cascina (he is even mentioned in Michelangelo's letters). He may have been in Rome before returning to Florence for about 5 years before his final return to Spain in 1517. He was, therefore, acquainted with the early work of Pontormo and Rosso at the very beginning of Mannerism. His own work as a painter is close to Rosso, and he probably finished the Coronation of the Virgin (Paris, Louvre) which was left incomplete by Filippino Lippi at his death in 1504. "
440,"BERRUGUETE, Pedro","(b. 1450, Paredes de Nava, d. 1504, Avila)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berrugue/pedro/biograph.html,"
Among the Spanish painters whose style may be regarded as transitional between Gothic and Renaissance, the foremost is undoubtedly Pedro Berruguete, a native of Parades de Nava in the province of Palencia. His pre-eminence derives from eclecticism and the spirit of humanity that permeate his art. Even during his apprenticeship, Berruguete had to struggle to master a number of divergent influences. After an early period in Flanders, or in the profoundly Flemish atmosphere of the Castilian Gothic, he went to Italy, where he remained for several years. These different elements of his training, perfectly assimilated by his unusually receptive, but stoutly Spanish nature, led him to a style rooted in Gothic ideals and Gothic forms, but Renaissance in the warmth of its humanism. His later painting reveals a certain progression toward a Hispano-Flemish Gothicism."
441,"BERTHÉLEMY, Jean-Simon","(b. 1743, Laon, d. 1811, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berthele/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. In 1764 he entered the studio of Noël Hallé, whose work strongly influenced his early paintings. Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot (Paris, Ecole Normal Supérieur des Beax-Arts), with which he won the Prix de Rome in 1767, is a brilliant exercise in the grand academic style as conceived by the followers of François Boucher. After a period at the Ecole Royale des Eleves Protégés he completed his training at the Académie de France in Rome from 1771 to 1774. Before his departure for Rome he had already gained a successful reputation based on the ceiling he executed on commission from the Comte de Saint-Florentin. He arrived in Rome in October, 1770, and correspondence from the director of the Académie Français, Charles-Joseph Natoire to the Surintendent des Bâtiments, Marigny, praised his work."
442,"BERTHOUD, Paul-François","(b. 1870, Paris, d. 1939, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/berthoud/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, painter, and engraver with the pseudonym Gilbert Lanquetin. He was the pupil of Pierre Dupuis and one of the founders of the Salon d'Automne where he exhibited regularly between 1907 and 1931. The influence of the sculptor Médardo Rosso (1858-1928) can be observed in Berthoud's work.



"
443,"BERTIN, Jean-Victor","(b. 1767, Paris, 1842, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertin/biograph.html,"
French painter and lithographer. In 1785 Bertin entered the Académie Royale de Peinture as a pupil of the history painter Gabriel-François Doyen. By 1788 he had become a pupil of the landscape painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes who directed him towards idealized Italianate landscape."
444,"BERTIN, Nicolas","(b. 1668, Paris, d. 1736, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertin_n/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. In 1678 he was apprenticed to Guy-Louis Vernansal; he later became a pupil of Jean Jouvenet and in 1684-85 of Bon Boullogne. By 1684 he was enrolled at the Académie Royale, Paris, and a year later won the Prix de Rome with his Construction of Noah's Ark (untraced). He probably arrived in Rome towards the end of 1685, and he stayed until the winter of 1688-89. While in Italy he studied the work of Raphael and the Carracci family, as well as showing an interest in Correggio. He also led a student protest against the teaching régime of the Académie de France in Rome."
445,"BERTOIA, Jacopo","(b. 1544, Parma, d. 1574, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertoia/biograph.html,"
Jacopo Bertoia (or Giacomo Zanguidi), Italian Mannerist painter, strongly influenced by Parmigianino."
446,BERTOLDO DI GIOVANNI,"(b. ca. 1420, d. 1491, Poggio a Caiano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertoldo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, pupil and assistant of Donatello (whose pulpits in S. Lorenzo he finished) and the teacher of Michelangelo, since he was employed by Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico, as keeper of his sculpture garden, which was one of the earliest modern academies. There he carved a Battle based on an antique sarcophagus, and probably also made the small bronzes of classical subjects - e.g. Bellerophon, Vienna. This was in the 1480s, and Bertoldo was said to be 'old'; but he is first recorded as Donatello's assistant in 1460, so the date of his birth may be later than c.1420, which is the current guess - he may have been a Medici bastard. There are works by him in Florence (Bargello), Modena and Paris (Louvre).




"
447,"BERTOS, Francesco",(active 1693-1733),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertos/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, born and died in Dolo, a small town near Padua. Documents record him as working in Rome in 1693 and in Venice in 1710. Records of his activity cease after 1733, the year in which he received a commission for two candlesticks for the basilica of Sant'Antonio (il Santo) in Padua."
448,"BERTOTTI SCAMOZZI, Ottavio","(b. 1719, Vicenza, d. 1790, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertotti/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and theorist. He was the son of Antonio Bertotti, a local barber, and Vittoria Scabora; through the patronage of Marchese Mario Capra, an amateur poet and architect, he was able to study architecture in the private school opened in Vicenza in 1748 by Domenico Cerato (1720-1792), and he became curator of the Accademia Olimpica in 1753. This gave him a small annual income and the use of the house attached to the Teatro Olimpico, Vicenza, for which he was responsible for the maintenance. For the rest of his life Bertotti Scamozzi superintended the restoration works on the theatre, to which he published an excellent guide in 1790."
449,"BERTRAND, Philippe","(b. 1663, Paris, d. 1724, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertrand/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the son of the sculptor David Bertrand (d. 1697), who is best known for a series of elaborate plaster overmantels, probably dating from the 1690s, of which two survive at the château of Dampierre, Seine-et-Oise. In 1694 Philippe Bertrand supplied four circular stone allegorical medallions for the Arc de Triomphe in the Place du Peyrou in Montpellier (in situ). The Baroque elaboration of their composition and drapery is also apparent, in more refined form, in the small bronze group of the Rape of Helen (e.g. Fontainebleau, Château) with which Bertrand was admitted to the Académie Royale in 1701. The medium of bronze suited Bertrand's fondness for fluid, graceful, and often flying bodies. Even in the grim subject of Prometheus Exposed he arranged the tortured man's limbs to elegant effect. His group of Mercury conducting Psyche to Heaven (Salon of 1704) is virtually a reworking of the Rape of Helen design, with buoyant additional grace and sense of lightness - suitably enough for its theme of celestial ascent."
450,BERTUCCIO DA VENEZIA,(active early 14th century in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bertucci/biograph.html,"
Italian master founder working in Venice. His name, nationality and artistic qualification is read, along with the date, on the inclusion engraved on the bronze door that closes the entrance to the left of the façade of the Basilica San Marco in Venice. His workshop was active in the Basilica."

Aureliano de Beruete y Moret, Spanish writer, painter and collector. After pursuing a political career and taking a doctorate in civil and canon law, he dedicated himself to writing on art and produced important studies on Diego Velázquez (1898), Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida (1901) and other artists. He travelled extensively and enthusiastically in Europe (France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, England and elsewhere), studying especially the different national schools of painting. On his travels he also painted landscapes."
452,"BESCHEY, Balthasar","(b. 1708, Antwerpen, d. 1776, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beschey/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and art dealer. He studied under Pieter Strick, an unknown painter who imitated the styles of accomplished Antwerp painters. In 1753 Beschey was admitted to the Painters' Guild of St Luke in Antwerp and two years later he was elected Dean of the Guild of Saint Luke (1775-1776). In 1755 he was made one of the six directors of the Academy of Arts in Antwerp. Using his influential position at the Academy, Beschey sought to revive traditional practices through the study of Rubens. Among his pupils were Pieter Jozef Verhaghen, Willem Herreyns, and Andries Cornelis Lens. Beschey held the position of Professor at the Academy of Arts in Antwerp up until his death in 1776."
453,"BESNARD, Albert","(b. 1849, Paris, d. 1934, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/besnard/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker and designer. He was born to an artistic family and was precociously talented. In 1866 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under Jean François Brémond (1807-1868) and Alexandre Cabanel. His Salon début in 1868 and his subsequent entries were well received, and in 1874 he won the Prix de Rome with the Death of Timophanes, Tyrant of Corinth (École Normale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris). Remaining in Italy for five years, Besnard worked in an academic style influenced by Pietro da Cortona and Michelangelo."
454,"BETTERA, Bartolomeo","(b. 1639, Bergamo, d. ca. 1688, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bettera/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo Bettera was an Italian painter, active in Bergamo in the second half of the seventeenth century. He was a specialist in still-lifes, and was a faithful imitator of Evaristo Baschenis.


"
455,"BETTES, John, I","(active 1531-1559, d. 1570, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bettes/john1/biograph.html,"
English painter and wood-engraver. His signed Portrait of a Man in a Black Cap (1545; London, Tate) is painted in the tradition of Hans Holbein the Younger and is a major factor in the unresolved debate about what studio, assistants or pupils Holbein had in England. A label on the back, cut from the portrait or from its original frame, reads faict par Johan Bettes Anglois, the 'Anglois' probably indicating that it was painted abroad. Three other portraits survive that might be by the same hand, the most likely on stylistic grounds being Sir William Cavendish (Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire) and Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth of Nettlestead (London, National Portrait Gallery)."
456,"BETTES, John, II","(d. 1616, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bettes/john2/biograph.html,"
English painter, son of John Bettes I. He was in a team employed during the Christmas season of 1578-79 by the Office of the Revels, which was responsible for stage scenery and properties and other decorative work. An attractive Portrait of a Girl (private collection), inscribed 'I. B.' and dated 1587, is attributed to him, and there are tentative attributions of several portraits of Elizabeth I and other ladies. The decorative treatment of costume is reminiscent of Nicholas Hilliard, under whom, according to Vertue, the artist studied."
457,"BETTI, Niccolò","(b. ca. 1550, Firenze, d. 1617, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/betti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After training in Florence with Michele Tosini, Betti was called to help with the decoration of Francesco de' Medici's studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio where his signed Sack of Corinth forms part of the series of the element of Fire. That work shows the unmistakable influence of both Giovan Battista Naldini and Francesco Morandini (1544-1597), known as il Poppi while his later paintings point to close knowledge of the works of Francesco Brina (c. 1540-c. 1586)."
458,BETTO DI GERI,(active 1366-1402 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/betto/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith. In 1366 Leonardo di ser Giovanni and Betto di Geri received the prestigious commission from the Arte di Calimala to make a silver altar decorated with scenes from the life of St John the Baptist (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence) for the Florentine Baptistery. According to the documents, they were paid in 1366 and 1367, but then the work was interrupted and not continued until 1377, when Leonardo was replaced with Cristofano di Paolo and Michele di Monte."
459,"BEUCKELAER, Joachim","(b. 1530, Antwerpen, d. 1574, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beuckela/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter of large still lifes, market and kitchen pieces - active in Antwerp. Beuckelaer was the nephew and pupil of Pieter Aertsen, and he followed his uncle's preference for scenes in which a religious subject is relegated to the background by the still life or genre content (The Cook, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). He seems to have been the first painter to depict fish stalls.



"
460,"BEVEREN, Mattheus van","(b. ca. 1630, Antwerpen, d. 1690, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beveren/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. He is thought to have been a pupil of Peeter Verbrugghen I (1615-1686) before becoming a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1649-50. He was a prolific sculptor of both small-scale works in ivory and terracotta and monumental pieces in marble, stone and wood. Notable examples of his ivories include a domestic altar with a Pietà (c. 1670; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels), a statuette of the Virgin and Child (c. 1680-90; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) and one of the Risen Christ (Begijnhofkerk, Antwerp) and several ivory crucifixes in the manner of François Duquesnoy (e.g. in the Minderbroedersklooster, St Catherine, Tongeren). Van Beveren also made medals, for example the terracotta model for a portrait medallion of Anthony van Dyck (after 1645; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) and produced designs for dies for the Antwerp Mint.



"
461,"BEVERWIJCK, Johan van","(b. 1594, Dordrecht, d. 1647, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beverwij/biograph.html,"
Johan van Beverwijck (Johannes Beverovicius), Dutch physician and writer. He studied in Leiden, Paris, Montpellier and Padua. Around 1618, he settled in his native city of Dordrecht where he became the first physician and judge of the city. His books related to health belonged to the most widely read books. He also left his mark on the Dutch language by words such as pancreas, rectum, to think collarbone or esophagus.



"
462,"BEVILACQUA, Giovanni Carlo","(b. 1775, Venezia, d. 1849, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bevilacq/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil of Francesco Maggiotto. He was born into a family of modest origins, however, had a good art education thanks to his parents. He won a prize in a competition organized by the Academy of Parma, however, he remained linked to Venice and the local Academy where he became a teacher."
463,"BEYEREN, Abraham van","(b. 1620, Den Haag, d. 1690, Overschie)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/beyeren/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (also spelled Beijeren or Beieren), little regarded in his day but now considered one of the greatest of still-life painters. He initially specialized in fish subjects, but around the middle of the 17th century he began to devote himself to sumptuous banquet tables laden with silver and gold vessels, Venetian glassware, fine fruit, and expensive table coverings of damask, satin, and velvet. Works of this kind, in which he was rivaled only by Kalf, gave him even greater opportunity than his fish pieces to demonstrate his ability to show the play of light on varied surfaces and organize forms and colours into an opulently blended composition. He worked in various towns before settling in Overschie in 1678. 



"
464,"BEZZI, Giovanni Francesco",(active c. 1530-1571 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bezzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draftsman (also known as Nosadella). He was active only briefly, first documented in 1558 and dying in 1571 in Bologna. He appears to have travelled to Rome. He was a pupil of Pellegrino Tibaldi. Few of his paintings have certain attribution; among them are a Madonna and Child with Saints, painted for the Oratorio of Santa Maria della Vita in Bologna, and a Circumcision (1571), painted for the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore and completed by Prospero Fontana."
465,"BEZZUOLI, Giuseppe","(b. 1784, Firenze, d. 1855, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bezzuoli/biograph.html,"
Giuseppe Bezzuoli (or Bazzuoli), Italian painter and teacher. A leading exponent of academic Romanticism in Italy, he initially received drawing lessons from his friend Luigi Sabatelli. From 1786 he attended the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Florence, where he studied under Giuseppe Piattoli (c. 1743-1823), Jean-Baptiste Desmarais (1756-1813) and Pietro Benvenuti. In 1811 he was made the Accademia's Aiuto Maestro di Disegno e Figura, and in 1812 he won the Concorso Triennale. In 1815-16 he made the first of several visits to Bologna, where he admired and studied its 17th-century painters. This marked the beginning of his romantic turn. Paolo and Francesca (1816; private collection), commissioned by the Conte Sante Alari of Milan, was the first Florentine work depicting a literary Romantic subject. Probably inspired by Sabatelli, it reflected a new Romantic ferment in the arts after the departure of the Bonapartes; two plays and a novel on the same theme were published around 1814-16. In 1816 Bezzuoli was made professor and became Sottomaestro di Disegno. He travelled to Rome and Naples in 1818-19 and to Venice in 1823. In Rome he encountered foreign artists, copied Raphael's School of Athens (Rome, Vatican, Stanza della Segnatura) for Conte Paolo Tosi from Brescia, and drew from Michelangelo, the Bolognese masters, and from nature in the Roman Campagna."
466,BIAGIO D'ANTONIO,"(b. 1446, Firenze, d. 1515, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/biagio/biograph.html,"
Biagio d'Antonio (full name: Biagio d'Antonio Tucci or Tuccio), Italian painter. He was previously confused with three other painters: Andrea Utili (fl 1481-96) of Faenza; 'Giovanni Battista Utili' (?1465-1516), whose second family name was Bertucci, also of Faenza; and Benedetto Ghirlandaio. His true identity was first documented by Grigioni, and Golfieri and Corbara then linked archival references to surviving paintings. Lightbown excludes the suggestion that he is the Biagio apprenticed to Botticelli, who, according to Vasari, was the victim of a practical joke played by his master."
467,"BIANCHI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1631, Verona, d. 1687, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bianch/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He was active mainly in the province of Verona, but he worked also in Bologna where he erected some altars. In Verona he was in charge of some works at the Church of the Scalzi and the Church of the Redeemer near the Rioman theater."

Italian painter Known as Il Creatura. His father, Giovanni Bianchi, a cooper, came from Tendola, near Sarzana. Pietro Bianchi was orphaned at the age of two and was taken in by one of his older sisters, whose husband, Arrigo Giorgi, was in the service of the Marchese Marcello Sacchetti. Bianchi was apprenticed to the painter Giacomo Triga (d. 1746) and then, when the latter left to complete his own training in Venice, moved to the studio of Giovanni Battista Gaulli (Baciccio); there Bianchi acquired his nickname on account of his youth and small stature."
470,"BIANCHI, Mosè","(b. 1840, Monza, d. 1904, Monza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bianchi1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher, son of the painter Giosuè Bianchi (1806-1875). Bianchi's family moved from Monza to Milan and he enrolled at the Brera Academy. Having interrupted his studies to serve in the second war of independence, he returned to attend the school of painting directed by Giuseppe Bertini (1797-1861)."
471,"BIANCO, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1590, Como, d. 1675, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bianco/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He is considered Genoa's greatest Baroque architect. Born at Como, he was the designer of several palaces in Genoa, where he moved to follow his father, also an architect. His works include the building which is now the centrepiece of the University of Genoa, the Palazzo Balbi at Campomorone and the Palazzo Rocca at Chiavari."

French sculptor, grandson of Colin Biard, and son of Noël Biard. He trained first with his father, a master carpenter, and then in Rome among the followers of Michelangelo. He was, with Mathieu Jacquet, the most important French-born sculptor active in France in the last years of the 16th century, a period dominated by foreign artists. In 1590 he was nominated Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi, but in 1592 this was rejected by the Cour des Comptes. In 1597 he executed the tomb of Jean-Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, Duc d'Epernon, at Cadillac, Gironde, of which the surviving fragments, such as the head from the reclining effigy of the Duchesse d'Epernon (marble; Musée d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux) and a bronze figure representing Fame (Musée du Louvre, Paris), indicate that he was a robust follower of Giambologna. In 1600 he provided two energetically modelled stone angels (in situ) for the side doors of the rood screen at Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, Paris. In 1603, for the Jardin de Diane at Fontainebleau, he decorated with four realistic sitting bronze bloodhounds and four bronze stags' heads the plinth of a bronze cast (in situ) of the antique statue of Diana the Huntress (Musée du Louvre, Paris)."
473,"BIARD, Pierre the Younger","(b. 1592, Paris, d. 1661, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/biard/younger/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and engraver. He was the son of Pierre Biard the Elder, and a pupil of Pietro Francavilla (Pierre Franqueville). He studied art in Italy. On his return to France, he was appointed sculptor to the king in 1609, and king's valet in 1612."

Italian painter. Lorenzo di Bicci's father was probably also a painter but all that is known of him is the name Bicci, the patronymic of Lorenzo (and probably a nickname for Jacopo). By 1370 Lorenzo had enrolled in the Florentine painters' guild."
475,BICCI DI LORENZO,"(b 1373, Firenze, d. 1452, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bicci/lorenzo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect. Son of the painter Lorenzo di Bicci, a traditional late follower of the artistic line of Orcagna, Bicci was similarly educated in art in his father's workshop, in which he began to share in the production of artistic products between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century (Tabernacolo del Madonnone, previously in Via Aretina, Florence; frescoes and sinopias now taken down and in the depositories of the Galleries in Florence). Having inherited the rich and flourishing workshop from his father in 1405, he continued the workshop. His widespread activity lasted for all the first half of the 15th century. This is witnessed by works for the Medicis (cycle of Illustrious Men frescoes in Palazzo Vecchio of Via Larga, documented by Vasari), for Niccolo da Uzzano (frescoes and panel in Santa Lucia de'Magnoli, documented but lost; triptych for the Villa in Greve, today in the Greve parish church), for the works on the Cathedral in Florence (cycle of frescoes of the Apostles produced for the consecration of the Cathedral in 1434), for the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova (fresco representing the Consecration of St. Egidio, originally on the facade of the church, now in the administrative offices of the Hospital), the chapel of San Giovanni Gualberto for the Compagni family in Santa Trinità (the frescoes still remain in the entrance arch, in the same church and the Triptych, at one time on the altar, now in Westminster Abbey, in London)."
476,BICCI DI NERI,"(b. 1419, Firenze, d. 1491, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bicci/neri/biograph.html,"
Bicci di Neri (or more frequently Neri di Bicci), Italian painter. Neri was the third in line from a family of artists: his father Bicci di Lorenzo and his grandfather Lorenzo di Bicci had been successful painters before him. He was a member of the Compagnia di San Luca in Florence by 1434 and began his artistic career as an assistant in his father's workshop, taking over its running after Bicci di Lorenzo became ill in 1446. It was after his father's death in 1452 that Neri di Bicci became an independent artist in his own right and he began keeping a diary, both professional and personal, which covers his principal years of activity from 1453 to 1475. This account, called Le Ricordanze, has been described as 'the most extensive surviving original document to record the activity of a 15th-century painter'."
477,"BIDAULD, Jean-Joseph-Xavier","(b. 1758, Carpentras, d. 1846, Montmorency)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bidauld/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was apprenticed in Lyon for six years with his brother Jean-Pierre-Xavier Bidauld (1745-1813), a landscape and still-life painter. Subsequently, they left Lyon to travel together in Switzerland and Provence. In 1783 he moved to Paris, where he met Joseph Vernet (from whom he received valuable advice), Joseph-Siffred Duplessis and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. In 1785 he went to Rome with the assistance of Cardinal de Bernis and his patron, the dealer and perfumer Dulac. He stayed there for five years, travelling through Tuscany, Umbria and Campania and painting such works as Roman Landscape (1788; Basle, Kunstmuseum)."
478,"BIERSTADT, Albert","(b. 1830, Solingen, d. 1902, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bierstad/biograph.html,"
German-born American painter of the Hudson River school. His parents immigrated to the U.S. when he was an infant. As a young man he traveled and sketched throughout Europe before returning to the U.S. to join a westward-bound expedition in 1859. In a career spanning the entire second half of the 19th century, he emerged as the first technically sophisticated artist to travel to the Far West of America, adapt European and Hudson River School prototypes to a new landscape and produce paintings powerful in their nationalistic and religious symbolism."
479,"BIGAGLIA, Pietro","(b. 1786, Murano, d. 1876, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bigaglia/biograph.html,"
Italian glassmaker from a family which owned glassmaking shops in Venice as early as 1674. Pietro was one  of the most accomplished glassmakers working in Venice in the 19th century. He made mirrors as well as lamps and window panes decorated with filigree and aventurine glass. Filigree is an opaque white or coloured glass which appears as swirling threads or spirals, and aventurine is a coloured glass which is made shiny with the addition of small flakes of gold or copper. They are both methods of glass ornamentation that died out, but were revived again by Bigaglia, and then later used in paperweight making."
480,"BIGARELLI, Guido di","(active ca. 1238, died 1257)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bigarell/biograph.html,"
Guido di Bonagiunta Bigarelli (also known as Guido da Como), Italian sculptor, born in Aragno, near Lugano, into a family of stonemasons. His activity as a marble carver is recorded in northwestern Tuscany in the important towns of Pisa, Lucca, and Pistoia. Since Guido was a common name among the many marble cutters from Como based in Tuscany, the reference to a Guidus de Como in Barga in 1238 might be to another craftsman."
481,"BIGARNY, Felipe","(b. ca. 1475, Langres, d. 1542, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bigarny/biograph.html,"
Felipe Bigarny or Vigarny (his name is variously spelled) sculptor and architect, active in Spain. He is sometimes regarded as Castilian. He appears, however, to have been a native of Burgundy. During the first phase of his career he introduced into Castile a style related to the late French Gothic.

"
482,"BIGG, William Redmore","(b. 1755, Felsted, d. 1828, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bigg/biograph.html,"
English painter. He became a pupil at London's Royal Academy in 1778 and studied under Edward Penny (1714-1791). He was elected a full member of the Academy in 1814. "
483,"BIGOT, Trophîme","(b. ca. 1600, Arles, d. 1650, Avignon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bigot/biograph.html,"Bigot, who was probably born in Arles, has just one picture certainly attributed to him, and it survives only as an engraving made towards the end of the seventeenth century. It is a Christ in the Carpenter's Shop. Round this lost painting was grouped a whole series of Caravaggesque pictures, apparently French in origin although derived from Honthorst in colour and general composition. Recent research has proved that this group is not coherent. Two large pictures painted for (and still in) the Church of Santa Maria in Aquiro, Rome, are documented as being a certain ""Maestro Jacopo"", although they were formerly attributed to Bigot.

"
484,"BIJLERT, Jan van","(b. 1597/98, Utrecht, d. 1671, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bijlert/biograph.html,"
Jan Harmensz. van Bijlert (also spelt Bylert), Dutch painter. He was the son of the Utrecht glass painter Herman Beerntsz. van Bijlert and Elisabeth Willemsdr van Laeckervelt. Jan must have trained first with his father but was later apprenticed to the painter Abraham Bloemaert. After his initial training, he visited France and travelled to Italy, as did other artists from Utrecht.

485,"BILIVERT, Giovanni","(b. 1576, Firenze, d. 1644, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bilivert/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draftsman of Dutch origin, son of Jacques Bijlivert (Jacopo Biliverti, 1550-1603), a goldsmith from Delft. He probably first studied painting with Alessandro Casolani (1552/3-1607) in Siena. After his father's death in 1603, Giovanni entered the studio of Lodovico Cigoli, following him in April 1604 to Rome, where he remained for most of the next three years."
486,"BILIVERT, Jacopo","(b. 1550, Delft, d. 1603, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bilivert/jacopo/biograph.html,"
Jacopo Bilivert (Jacques Bijlivert), Dutch goldsmith, active in Italy. He served his apprenticeship in Delft or Augsburg and travelled to Florence in 1573 to head the workshops of Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici, supervising small groups of goldsmiths from various countries. It is said that he received his first commission, a pendant (untraced) for the Duke, six days after his arrival. In 1576 he married Fiametta Mazzafiri who was probably related to the goldsmith Michele Mazzafiri of the Medici workshops."
487,"BILTIUS, Cornelis","(b. 1653, Den Haag, d. ca. 1686, Germany)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/biltius/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of the still-life painter Jacob Biltius (1633-1681). He was active in Amsterdam and Maastricht, then from 1670 in Germany, where he died. In the 1670s he was in Bonn and Keulen, in the 1680s in Würzburg, Nuremberg and Bamberg."
488,"BIMBI, Bartolomeo","(b. 1648, Settignano, d. 1730, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bimbi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied in Rome with Mario dei Fiori, then with Lorenzo Lippi, Onorio Marinari and Agnolo Gori (1610/20-78). He was employed at the Medici court, particularly under Ferdinand II and Cosimo III de' Medici and by Cosimo's daughter the Electress Palatine Anna Maria Luisa, to paint large canvases of flora and fauna for the Medici Villa dell'Ambrogiana and della Topaia, now conserved in the Pitti Palace and the Museo Botanico dell'Università. He specialized in painting from nature animals or vegetables that had some extraordinary or freakish aspect; he classified these by species, season or place of origin. His style, which remained constant throughout his long career, is distinguished by its scientific accuracy, and he must have had close contact with scientists and naturalists."
489,"BINAGO, Lorenzo","(b. 1554, Milano, d. 1629, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/binago/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and Barnabite monk, also known as Lorenzo Biffi. He was an important innovator during the transition period between Late Mannerism and Early Baroque in Milan. He is mainly known as the architect of the church of Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia (begun 1601), considered one of the most impressive constructions of Lombard architecture. In 1611, he was called to Brescia to participate in the construction of the New Cathedral."
490,"BINCK, Jacob","(b. ca. 1500, Köln, d. ca. 1569, Königsberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/binck/biograph.html,"
German painter, engraver, medallist and builder of fortifications. He painted portraits of King Christian II of Denmark and Queen Elisabeth I during their period of exile in the Netherlands, before transferring to the service of King Frederik I and continuing as portrait painter and engraver for King Christian III. In the 1540s, he was ""lent out"" to Duke Albrecht of Prussia, but returned to Denmark to do the portrait for King Christian III's edition of the Bible. King Christian III also employed him as a travelling art advisor, in addition to which he served for a period with the king's architect, Morten Bussert, working on the construction of fortifications in the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, based on experience reaped from his time spent in the Netherlands. He is thought to have moved to Königsberg in East Prussia in 1554.



"
491,"BINDESBØLL, Michael Gottlieb","(b. 1800, Ledøje, d. 1856, Frederiksberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bindesbo/biograph.html,"
Danish architect. Most known for his design of Thorvaldsens Museum in Copenhagen, he was a key figure in the stylistic shift in Danish architecture from late classicism to Historicism. For Bindesbøll, changing styles was the prelude to amusement and he juggled freely with older models."
492,"BINGHAM, George Caleb","(b. 1811, Augusta County, d. 1879, Kansas City)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bingham/biograph.html,"
American painter. He worked mainly in Missouri (where he held several political posts), painting the life of the frontier people. Except for a short period studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, he was self-taught. His finest canvases, particularly the celebrated Fur Traders Descending the Missouri (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1845), distil visual poetry from the commonplace, but after a trip to study in Düsseldorf in 1856-58 his work lost much of its racy freshness and charm, becoming overlaid with sentimentality.



"
493,"BINOIT, Peter","(b. ca. 1590, Köln, d. 1632, Hanau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/binoit/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was the pupil of Daniel Soreau (c. 1554-1619) whose niece he married in 1627. He painted flower pieces, his earliest known dated work is from 1611.



"
494,"BIRAGO, Giovanni Pietro",(active 1471-1513 in Milan),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/birago/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and engraver. In 1894 he was tentatively associated with his principal work, the Hours of Bona Sforza (British Library, London), and became known as the Master of the Sforza Book of Hours; in 1956 he was conclusively identified by his signature PSBR IO PETR BIRAGVS FT on the frontispiece of a copy (National Library, Warsaw) of Giovanni Simonetta's life of Francesco Sforza, the Sforziada, published first in Latin and then in Italian translation at Milan in 1490."
495,"BIRGER, Hugo","(b. 1854, Stockholm, d. 1887, Helsingborg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/birger/biograph.html,"
Hugo Birger (born Hugo Birger Petterson), Swedish painter. He studied at the Konstakademi in Stockholm from 1871 to 1877. In 1877 he went to Paris and then spent the summer of 1878 at Barbizon with Carl Larsson, among others. There he painted several spontaneous plein-air paintings, such as Rue Gabrielle (1879; Kunstmuseum, Gothenburg), in which the grey tones are contrasted realistically with exquisite colours. He also painted scenes of Parisian life, such as The Toilette (1880; two sketches in Nationalmuseum, Stockholm), which aroused the interest of his contemporaries when it was exhibited at the Salon that year."
496,"BISCAINO, Bartolomeo","(b. 1629, Genova, d. 1657, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/biscaino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and etcher. His life was cut short by the plague, and little is known about him. He was taught by his father, Giovanni Andrea Biscaino (1605-1657), a mediocre landscape painter, and entered the workshop of Valerio Castello, probably at the end of the 1640s. Biscaino's early paintings strongly recalled his master's style, but his forms were softer, his brushstroke broader, and his choice of colours more delicate. Curving draperies and sweetness of expression typified Biscaino's manner. "
497,"BISET, Karel Emmanuel","(b. 1633, Mechelen, d. ca. 1710)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/biset/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He had a peripatetic career working in various cities and countries including his hometown Mechelen, Paris, Annonay, Brussels, Antwerp and Breda. He worked in many genres including genre scenes of interiors with merry companies and gallery paintings, history painting, still-life and portraiture.


"
498,"BISON, Giuseppe Bernardino","(b. 1762, Palmanova, d. 1844, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bison/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil of Gerolamo Romani and Constantino Cedini in the Accademia of Venice. He was influenced by the Tiepolo and Francesco Guardi as well as Marco Ricci, Giuseppe Zais and Antonio Diziani and should be considered as one of the important artists who absorbed the characteristics of 18th-century Venetian painting and carried it forward into the 19th century. He is known mainly for his history pieces, genre depictions, and whimsical and imaginary landscapes, including veduta di fantasia or capricci. Most of his output was while working in Venice or in the near mainland (Ferrara, Trieste, and Padua). He died in Milan.



"
499,"BISSCHOP, Abraham","(b. 1670, Dordrecht, d. 1729, Middelburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bisschop/abraham/biograph.html,"
Abraham Bisschop (also Busschop), Dutch painter. He was the youngest son and pupil of Cornelis Bisschop, a court painter to the King of Denmark. He was registered with the Guild of Middelburg in 1715. He painted still-lifes, flower paintings, animals and birds."
500,"BISSCHOP, Cornelis","(b. 1630, Dordrecht, d. 1674, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bisschop/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Cornelis Bisschop (also Busschop), Dutch painter, active in Dordrecht. In c. 1650 he was a student of Ferdinand Bol in Amsterdam. In 1653 he was back in Dordrecht, set up his studio and married Geertruyt Botland. The couple had twelve children. Shortly before his death, Bisschop was invited by the King of Denmark to become his court painter."
501,"BISSCHOP, Jan de","(b. 1628, Amsterdam, d. 1671, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bisschox/biograph.html,"
Dutch draughtsman and etcher. He was a lawyer by profession and a skilled amateur draughtsman. At the Amsterdam Latin school his teacher was the humanist Hadrianus Junius (1511-75), under whose supervision he wrote a poem about the Atheneum Illustre and Collegium Auriacum in Breda, published by Johannes Blaeu in 1647. From 1648 to 1652 he read law at Leiden University. In 1653 he married Anna van Baerle, daughter of the famous professor and theologian Caspar van Baerle (1584-1648), and throughout his life he moved in prominent intellectual circles. One of his closest friends was Constantijn Huygens the younger, who was also an amateur draughtsman, with a very similar drawing style (especially in landscapes), and who was probably a member - with Jacob van der Does (1623-73) and Willem Doudijns (1630-97) - of the small drawing academy that de Bisschop founded in The Hague."
502,"BISSEN, Hermann Wilhelm","(b. 1798, Schleswig, d. 1868, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bissen/biograph.html,"
Danish sculptor. He first studied painting in Copenhagen, then became a pupil of the sculptor Berthel Thorvaldsen. In 1824, he travelled to Rome and met Christian Daniel Rauch in Berlin. Under the influence of Thorvaldsen, his style changed from Romanticism to Neo-classicism."
503,"BLAEU, Willem Janszoon","(b. 1571, Uitgeest, d. 1638, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blaeu/biograph.html,"
Dutch cartographer, printmaker, editor and book dealer. As the son of a well-to-do herring salesman, he was destined to succeed his father in the trade, but his interests lay more in mathematics and astronomy. Between 1594 and 1596 as a student of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) he qualified as an instrument and globe maker. In 1600 he discovered the second ever variable star now known as P Cygni."
504,"BLAKE, William","(b. 1757, London, d. 1827, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blake/biograph.html,"
English artist, draughtsman, engraver, philosopher, and poet, one of the most remarkable figures of the Romantic period. From childhood he possessed visionary powers, and the engraving of Joseph of Arimathea, done at the age of 16, shows him already using a personal symbolism to express his mystical philosophy. His apprenticeship (1772-79) to the engraver James Basire (1730-1802), for whom he made drawings of the monuments in Westminster Abbey and other London churches, led him to a dose study of Gothic art and intensified his love of linear design and formal pattern. In 1779 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, but his relations with Reynolds were painful; later he was to find more sympathetic spirits in Stothard, Flaxman, Fuseli, and Barry."
505,"BLANCHARD, Jacques","(b. 1600, Paris, d. 1638, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blanchar/biograph.html,"
French painter. Nothing seems to be known of his work before he left for Rome at the age of twenty-four. After two years he moved to Venice, where he remained for two more years. It was there that his style was formed. He then went to Turin, where he worked for the Dukes of Savoy, before returning to France 1628. It is from the brief but productive period after his return that all his dated works survive. They show him to stand quite apart from his contemporaries, not only in his painting style but also in his choice of sensual  subject-matter, for example the Bacchanal at Nancy."
506,"BLANCHARD, Pharamond","(b. 1805, La Guillotière, d. 1873, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blanchax/biograph.html,"
Henri-Pierre-Léon-Pharamond Blanchard was a French painter. He entered the École des Beaux-Arts as a pupil of Antoine-Jean Gros in 1819. He visited Spain in 1826 and in 1833 accompanied Baron Taylor for a second trip to collaborate on the illustration of the Voyage pittoresque en Espagne. There Blanchard painted genre subjects, bullfighting scenes, and tales of Spanish brigands."
507,"BLANCHET, Louis-Gabriel","(b. 1705, Paris, d. 1772, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blanche/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in Rome. He won second place in the Prix de Rome competition in 1727 and thereafter settled in Rome, where he enjoyed the patronage of Nicolas Vleughels, Director of the Académie de France, and the Duc de Saint-Aignan (1684-1776), who at that time was French Ambassador to the Holy See. A virtuoso portraitist, Blanchet painted many of the likenesses of the leading social and political figures in Rome of the day,"
508,"BLANCHET, Thomas","(b. 1614, Paris, d. 1689, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blanchet/biograph.html,"
French painter and sculptor. During his training in Paris Blanchet met Jacques Sarazin, and on his advice moved from studying sculpture to painting. During this time he familiarised himself with the Baroque and the School of Fontainebleau's Mannerism, new imports into Paris at this time. Among his probably co-students was Simon Vouet."
509,"BLECHEN, Karl","(b. 1797, Cottbus, d. 1840, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blechen/biograph.html,"

512,"BLES, Herri met de",(c. 1500 - after 1550),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bles/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter of landscapes with figures. He is an enigmatic figure presumed to be one and the same as the Herri Patenier who entered the Antwerp Guild in 1535. Herri met de Bles, as van Mander informs us, is simply a nickname meaning 'Herri with the white forelock', and it is generally assumed that he was a relation of Joachim Patenier, who certainly had a decisive influence on his work. No signed or documented work by Herri exists, but a small group of distinctive works has been ascribed to him, characterized by panoramic landscapes dominating the figure groups in the manner of Patenier. His work was popular with Italian collectors, who called him 'Civetta' (little owl) because he often included owls in his pictures.

Flemish painter, member of a Flemish family of painters and draughtsmen, active also in Italy and France, brother of Pieter van Bloemen. While still in their native Antwerp, Pieter was the first teacher of his brother Jan Frans - who later also studied with Antoine Goubau - and probably also of his younger brother Norbert (1670-c. 1746). From 1667 Pieter had himself trained with Simon van Douw (c. 1630-c. 1677). He is recorded in Lyon c. 1684. At about the same time Jan Frans was in Paris, until he was summoned by his brother to Lyon. There Jan Frans apparently worked with van der Cabel."

While still in their native Antwerp, Pieter was the first teacher of his brothers. Norbert worked in Italy where he was called Cephalus (Cefalo). From Italy he went to the Netherlands and settled in Amsterdam where he painted genre scenes, portraits and religious paintings.



"
523,"BLOEMEN, Pieter van","(b. 1657, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1720, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bloemen/pieter/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, member of a Flamish family of painters and draughtsmen, active also in Italy and France, brother of Jan Frans van Bloemen. While still in their native Antwerp, Pieter was the first teacher of his brother Jan Frans - who later also studied with Antoine Goubau - and probably also of his younger brother Norbert (1670-c. 1746). From 1667 Pieter had himself trained with Simon van Douw (c. 1630-c. 1677), and in 1673 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. The following year he travelled to Rome. He is recorded in Lyon about a decade later (c. 1684) in the company of the Dutch artists Adriaen van der Cabel and Gillis Weenix. At about the same time (c. 1684-85) Jan Frans was in Paris, until he was summoned by his brother to Lyon. The two brothers were not happy in Lyon, however, and went to Rome. They travelled via Turin, staying there for some time. From 1686-87 they were in Rome, where they were both members of the Schildersbent, the confraternity of Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. Pieter was given the bent or nickname Standaart (or Stendardo), undoubtedly a reference to the banners and standards that he depicted in his scenes of soldiers; Jan Frans's facility for producing panoramic landscapes earned him the nickname Orizzonte (It.: 'horizon'), which had previously been applied to Claude Lorrain."
524,"BLOMMENDAEL, Jan","(b. 1650, Den Haag, d. 1707, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blommen/biograph.html,"
Dutch sculptor. He was probably a pupil of Rombout Verhulst. He is first heard of in 1671, when he paid the Guild of St Joseph for the rights of his shop. In 1675 he joined Pictura, the Hague guild of painters; he must already have been an experienced sculptor, as he was asked to pay the highest entrance fee and was called 'Monsieur'. Like Verhulst, he made a great number of funerary monuments, several of which have survived. They include that of Jacob de Brauw (signed and dated 1684; Ketel, Dutch Reformed Church); Admiral Johan van Brakel (signed and dated 1691; Rotterdam, Grote (St Laurens) Kerk); and Pieter de Huybert (signed and dated 1697) and J. de Huybert (signed and dated 1701; both Burg, Dutch Reformed Church). Such monuments usually consist of portraits in relief or busts, set in an architectural frame. In the case of the monument of Johan van Brakel, Blommendael used a new iconographical type, which was to become very popular in the 18th century; it had an obelisk rising out of the centre and a portrait bust or medallion placed against it.



"
525,"BLOMMENDAEL, Reyer van","(b. 1628, Amsterdam, d. 1675, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blommend/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Little is known about the life of Reyer Jacobsz van Blommendael except for a few details gleaned from documents concerning a certain Risje van Blommendael, who was a wealthy resident of Haarlem. For instance, a notarial deed drawn up in Haarlem in 1676 reveals that she had a brother called Reyer who was a painter. On 27 June 1628, a Reyer was baptised in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam: he was the son of Jacob Reijersz and Grietje Jans. This may well have been the child who grew up to be our painter, as two years earlier a girl by the name of Risje, the daughter of Jacob Reijersz and Grietje Reijners, had been baptised in the same church."
526,"BLONDEEL, Lanceloot",(1498-1561),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blondeel/biograph.html,"
Flemish artist who entered the Guild of Painters in Bruges in 1519, and also worked as an architect and designed sculpture, tapestries, and pageant decorations. In 1550 he and Jan van Scorel were commissioned to restore the van Eycks' celebrated Ghent Altarpiece. The triptych of The martyrdom of SS. Cosmas and Damian (S. Jacques, Bruges) is typical of his work as a painter in its profusion of Italian ornament. By the 16th century Bruges had declined greatly in importance as a trading centre as its port silted up, and Blondeel represents one of the last sparks of its great artistic tradition.



"
527,"BLONDEL, Merry-Joseph","(b. 1781, Paris, d. 1853, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blondel/biograph.html,"
French painter. After an apprenticeship at the Dihl et Guerhard porcelain factory in Paris, where he was taught by Etienne Leguay (1762-1846), Blondel moved to Jean-Baptiste Regnault's atelier in 1802. He won the Prix de Rome in 1803 with Aeneas and Anchises (Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Baux-Arts) but did not go to Rome until 1809, when he stayed there for three years. Upon his return to Paris, Blondel was elected a member of the Academy of Beaux-Arts and accepted a post at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and he received many commissions."
528,"BLONDEL, François","(b. 1628, Ribemont, d. 1686, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blondelf/biograph.html,"
[Nicolas]-François Blondel, French architect, teacher and writer. He was born to a newly ennobled member of the household of the queen-mother, Marie de' Medici. He joined the army and became a military engineer, attaining the rank of Maréchal de Camp by 1652. In that year he was seconded by one of the secretaries of state for foreign affairs, the Comte de Brienne, to accompany his son on a comprehensive Grand Tour of Europe. On his return in 1655 Blondel was equipped with an unrivalled range of first-hand experience that recommended him for a diplomatic career, although the following year he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Collège de France. Diplomatic missions took him to Prussia, Sweden and Turkey and, while waiting on the Sultan, he visited Greece and Egypt. He was ambassador to Denmark in 1659-63. Thereafter he rejoined the armed services and was assigned to the navy as an engineer responsible for port and coastal defences in Normandy and Brittany, most notably transforming Saintes and constructing the new port and arsenal of Rochefort."
529,"BLONDEL, Jacques-François","(b. 1705, Rouen, d. 1774, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/blondelj/biograph.html,"
French architect best known for his teaching and writing, which contributed greatly to architectural theory and the taste of his time. His art school in Paris was the first such institution to teach architecture."
530,"BLOOT, Pieter de","(b. 1601, Rotterdam, d. 1658, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bloot/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape and genre painter active in his native Rotterdam. He specialized in countryside views and peasant subjects, such as Drunken Peasants Fighting (Muzeum Narodowe, Poznan) and Dancing in a Tavern (Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest). His tavern scenes have some affinity to those by Adriaen Brouwer. Jan van Goyen influenced his landscapes but has more figures and is richer in narrative detail. He also painted religious subjects. St Martin and the Beggar (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) shows the saint cutting his cloak in half to share it with a beggar at Amiens; a crowd of crippled beggars witnesses the scene. One of his early interior scenes, In the Lawyer's Office (1628, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), is an interesting record of such an establishment in 17th-century Holland, humorous in its depiction of clients queuing at the counters with children and dogs. 



"
531,"BOBADILLA, Jerónimo de","(b. ca. 1620, Sevilla, d. 1709, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bobadill/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He probably learnt to paint in Seville c. 1640 and was influenced by Zurbarán. He married in 1654 in Antequera but continued to paint in Seville, where from 1660 he was included in the roll of members of the Academia de Pintores. He was one of the most respected artists in that city during the second half of the 17th century.



"
532,"BOCANEGRA, Pedro Anastasio","(b. 1638, Granada, d. 1689, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bocanegr/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. After youthful study with Spanish Baroque painter Alonso Cano, Pedro Atanasio Bocanegra absorbed many elements of Cano's art and followed in his master's footsteps to become a major painter in Granada. From 1668 he began to receive important commissions. In 1670 he painted a series of canvases (in situ) on the Life of the Virgin for the lateral walls of the church of the Charterhouse in Granada. These paintings displayed Cano's influence in their lively colouring and dynamic compositions, along with vigorous Baroque illusionistic effects. Almost immediately after finishing these works, he painted two more small compositions for the chancel depicting the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Adoration of the Magi (in situ). He followed this commission with several large works in 1672-73 for the convent of the Discalced Trinitarians, also in Granada."
533,"BOCCACCINO, Boccaccio","(b. ca. 1460, Ferrara, d. 1525, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boccacci/boccacci/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, father of Camillo Boccaccini. He is first recorded in 1493 in Genoa, where he contracted to paint the high altarpiece (untraced) for S Maria della Consolazione. He studied with followers of Mantegna, at Ferrara, and was a pupil or fellow-student of Domenico Panetti. In 1497 he was extracted from prison in Milan by the agent of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and worked for the Duke in Ferrara until 1500. Perhaps as a consequence of having killed his common-law wife he then left, presumably for Venice, where he is recorded as residing in 1505. A fresco in Cremona Cathedral is dated 1506, and Cremona was his principal workplace thereafter. In Cremona he painted in Sant'Agostino a series of frescoes. A number of his paintings greatly resemble those of Perugino, among them those in the church of San Vincenzo."
534,"BOCCACCINO, Camillo","(b. 1504/5, Cremona, d. 1546, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boccacci/camillo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, son and pupil of Boccaccio Boccaccino. He probably received his initial training from his father, but was influenced at an early stage by Pordenone's Cremonese works, and also by Titian, whom he evidently came to know during his long sojourn in Venice (documented until 1525). His earliest known works show these influences and that of contemporary Brescian painters. They include the Virgin and Saints altarpiece from S Maria del Cistello (1527; Prague, National Gallery), the imposing organ shutters of David and Saul from S Maria di Campagna in Piacenza (1530; Piacenza, Museo Civico) and the Annunciation (Piacenza, S Maria di Campagna), which was cut down to fit the church's apse. These works show a remarkable maturity and originality in the use of colour and chiaroscuro to create illusionistic effects.



"
535,"BOCCATI, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1420, Camerino, d. 1487)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boccati/biograph.html,"
Giovanni di Piermatteo Boccati (also Boccato or Giovanni di Piermatteo Boccati da Camerino) was an Italian painter, active in Umbria. He obtained citizenship in Perugia in 1445. Initially he was influenced by the Florentine masters Lippi, Fra Angelico and Uccello, amongst others, later by the Sienese, in particular Domenico di Bartolo.
"
536,"BOCCHI, Faustino","(b. 1659, Brescia, d. 1742, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bocchi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Brescia. He specialized in bizarre paintings of dwarfs. He was a pupil of Angelo Everardi (1647-1678, called il Fiamminghino or Fiammenghino)."
537,"BÖCKLIN, Arnold","(b. 1827, Basel, d. 1901, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bocklin/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter. He was, with Ferdinand Hodler the major Swiss painter of the 19th century, and he exerted a great influence on the German-speaking countries through the expression of a heightened Romanticism and poeticism."
538,"BOCKSBERGER, Hans the Elder","(b. ca. 1510, Salzburg, d. before 1569, Salzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bocksber/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, designer and woodcutter, part of a family of artists. The Salzburg painter Ulrich Bocksberger (active 1490–1518) probably trained his son Hans Bocksberger the Elder. The son of the latter, Hans Bocksberger the Younger (active 1564–79), has been confused with Melchior Bocksberger (c. 1532-1587), leading to the composite coinage of 'Johann Melchior Bocksberger'. Melchior was in fact probably the nephew of Hans Bocksberger the Elder. Hans the Younger, who is documented in Vienna by 1579, is best known for the woodcut plates he made for Jost Amman."
539,"BOECKHORST, Jan van","(b. ca. 1604, Münster or Rees, d. 1668, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boeckhor/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman of German birth (also Johann Bockhorst). Born in either Germany or Flanders in 1604, very few of his paintings are known. Around 1626 he moved to Antwerp. According to de Bie and Filips Rubens (Vita Petri Pauli Rubenii, 1676), he became a pupil or assistant of Jacob Jordaens and Peter Paul Rubens; the style of his work bears this out. A document of 1655 reveals that Boeckhorst painted a 'Silenus', which was subsequently retouched by Rubens and which must have been made under his supervision (i.e. Rubens's typical workshop practice). Boeckhorst must have had a good relationship with Rubens during the 1630s, as he was one of those who contributed to the large series of paintings Rubens was then working on for the decorations of the Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi (1635; destroyed) and for the Torre de la Parada (1637-38). After Rubens's death in 1640, Boeckhorst completed his unfinished works."
540,"BOECKSTUYNS, Jan Frans","(b. ca. 1650, Mechelen, d. 1734, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boeckstu/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor and architect. He was a pupil of Lucas Faydherbe, with whom he came under the influence of the ideas of Rubens. Boeckstuyns became Master in the Mechelen St Luke Guild in 1680."
541,"BOEL, Pieter","(b. 1626, Antwerpen, d. 1674, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boel/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He probably went to Italy in 1650-51 and then became a master of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp. In 1668 he worked for Charles Le Brun at his Parisian tapestry workshop, as well as being a court painter ('peintre ordinaire du roi'). Among other things he painted animals in the style of Fyt, as well as vanitas still-lifes.



"
542,"BOELEMA DE STOMME, Maerten","(b. 1611, Leeuwarden, d. ca. 1664, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boelema/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of still-lifes. Born in Leeuwarden in 1611, Maerten (or Martinus) was a deaf-mute (hence his byname 'De Stomme'), who was recorded in Haarlem in 1642 where he was accepted as a pupil of Willem Claesz. Heda. He must have been a trained painter before he came to work in Heda's studio in 1642. Boelema's dated works only span a two-year period, from 1642 until 1644. There are about twenty signed still-lifes known by the artist.



"
543,"BOEYERMANS, Theodor","(b. 1620, Antwerpen, d. 1678, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boeyerma/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. In 1634 his mother was granted a free passage to Holland and moved to Eindhoven, presumably with the 14-year-old Theodor. In April 1640 he was granted permission in Antwerp for another visit north, where he probably finished his studies. He may have followed an artistic education in the studio of Van Dyck as the master's influence is noticeable in his works."
544,"BOFFRAND, Germain","(b. 1667, Nantes, d. 1754, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boffrand/biograph.html,"
Germain Boffrand (in full Gabriel-Germain Boffrand), French architect and writer, noted for the great variety, quantity, and quality of his work. He maintained the tradition of the Grand Style in France between Jules Hardouin-Mansart, who was born in 1646, and Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who died in 1782. His work also provided an important bridge between that of Louis Le Vau in the mid-17th century and those of the architects of the Piranesian generation of Neo-classicists in the mid-18th century, such as Etienne-Louis Boullée, whom he influenced."
545,"BOFILL, Guillem","(d. 1427, Girona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bofill/biograph.html,"
Catalan architect. He began working as a stonemason in the works of the church of Sant Feliu in Girona (1381-83), later moving to the Cathedral of Girona, where in 1404 he was appointed master builder. In 1416 he was promoted, supported by the bishop Dalmau de Mur, to the board of architects that had to decide the way to continue the works. Here he imposed his criterion of doing so with a single nave that would increase the height of the nave extraordinarily. His project was approved in 1417. The works continued under his direction until 1427, probably the date of his death.



"
546,"BOGAERT, Hendrick","(b. ca. 1626, Amsterdam, d. after 1674, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bogaer/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam. He is known for genre works featuring farm scenes. Although little is known about the life and work of Hendrick Bogaert, a number of paintings which had traditionally been attributed to the Delft painter Egbert van der Poel, have recently been added to Bogaert's output."
547,"BOGAERT, Jan",(active around 1550 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bogaert/biograph.html,"
Jan Bogart was a Flemish potter, active around the mid-sixteenth century in Antwerp. No details of his life are known.



"
548,"BOGDÁNY, Jakab","(b. ca. 1660, Eperjes, d. 1724, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bogdany/biograph.html,"
Jakab Bogdány (Jacob Bogdani), Hungarian painter, active in the Netherlands and England. He began his art studies in Vienna, then moved to Amsterdam in 1684, and to London around 1690 where he worked for Queen Mary, William III and Queen Anne. His orderers included Admiral Churchill, E. Harley and others close to the Court. His success was mostly due to his colourful still-lifes with birds, i.e. pictures resembling Dutch painting. Around 1700 he painted pictures for the Hall of Mirrorrs of Queen Mary in Water Galley, not far from Hampton Court."
549,"BOGUET, Nicolas-Didier","(b. 1755, Chantilly, d. 1839, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boguet/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. Sent to Paris at the age of 23 as a protégé of the Prince de Condé, he was admitted to the Académie on the recommendation of Augustin Pajou to study history painting. In 1783 he went to Rome, where he began to concentrate on landscape, spending the summer months outdoors in the Roman Campagna. These trips resulted in hundreds of drawings (Rome, Palazzo Farnesina), the best of which have been compared to those of Claude Lorrain."
550,"BOILLY, Louis Léopold","(b. 1761, La Bassé, d. 1845, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boilly/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. The son of a wood-carver, Arnould Boilly (1764-79), he lived in Douai until 1778, when he went to Arras to receive instruction in trompe l'oeil painting from Dominique Doncre (1743-1820). He moved to Paris in 1785. Between 1789 and 1791 he executed eight small scenes on moralizing and amorous subjects for the Avignon collector Esprit-Claude-François Calvet (1728-1810), including The Visit (1789; Saint-Omer, Musée Hôtel Sandelin). He exhibited at the Salon between 1791 and 1824 and received a gold medal at the Salon of 1804. From the beginning his genre subjects were extremely popular with the public and collectors. In 1833, at a time when his popularity was declining, he was admitted to the Légion d'honneur and the Institut de France.



"
551,"BOISSEAU, Émile-André","(b. 1842, Varzy, d. 1923, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boisseau/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, under Augustin-Alexandre Dumont and Jean-Marie Bonnassieux. He is the author of many works of academic character and well known for his graceful groups of women and children. His most celebrated group was his Le Crépuscule (The Dusk), which shows a winged personification of Dusk sheltering two sleeping putti. It was exhibited at the Salon in 1870 and won the prestigious gold medal, before being purchased for the Élysée Palace."
552,"BOISSIEU, Jean-Jacques de","(b. 1736, Lyon, d. 1810, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boissieu/biograph.html,"
French painter, draftsman, and etcher. A largely self-taught artist, Jean-Jacques de Boissieu toured extensively in Europe before settling in his native Lyons. On his travels, Boissieu developed a particular interest in landscape painting and spent as much time sketching outdoors as he did studying in museums. Boissieu was of fragile health and could not tolerate the strong odour of turpentine used in oil painting; instead he focused his energies on engravings and drawings in ink and wash. "
553,"BOITAC, Diogo","(b. ca. 1460, d. ca. 1528, Batalha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boitac/biograph.html,"
Portuguese architect. In fact the nationality of Diogo Boitac (Boytac or Boitaca) is unknown. He was an influential architect and engineer of some of the most important Portuguese buildings, working in Portugal in the first half of the 16th century."
554,"BOITO, Camillo","(b. 1836, Roma, d. 1914, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boito/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, teacher, restorer and writer. He was the elder brother of Arrigo Boito, composer and author of the libretti for Giuseppe Verdi's last two great operas, Otello and Falstaff."
555,"BOIZOT, Louis-Simon","(b. 1743, Paris, d. 1809, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boizot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the son of Antoine Boizot (1704-82), a designer at the Gobelins, and a pupil of René-Michel Slodtz. He studied at the Académie Royale, Paris, winning the Prix de Rome in 1762, and after a period at the Ecole Royale des Eleves Protégés he completed his education from 1765 to 1770 at the Académie de France in Rome. He was accepted (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1771, presenting the model (untraced) for a statuette of Meleager, but was not received (reçu) as a full member until 1778, when he completed the marble version (Paris, Louvre). He exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon until 1800. In 1773, he was appointed artistic director of the sculpture studio at the Royal Porcelain Manufactory at Sèvres, a position he held until 1806."
556,"BOL, Ferdinand","(b. 1616, Dordrecht, d. 1680, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bol/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher. He was a pupil of Rembrandt in the mid-1630s and in his early work imitated his master's style so well as to create occasional difficulty in distinguishing between them. The portrait of Elizabeth Bas in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, is the best-known instance; it was acknowledged as a Rembrandt until 1911, when it was attributed to Bol, and although this opinion is still generally accepted, there has been renewed support for Rembrandt as the author."
557,"BOL, Hans","(b. 1534, Mechelen, d. 1593, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bol_h/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman. He received his training as a painter from two of his uncles, Jacob Bol and Jan Bol. After two years in Heidelberg, he was made a master in the Mechelen Guild of St Luke. After the annexation of the city by the Spanish troops in 1572, Bol settled in Antwerp, where he became a master in 1574. A decade later he left Antwerp, arriving in Amsterdam after travelling to Bergen-op-Zoom, Dordrecht and Delft. Van Mander's statement that he was buried in Amsterdam on 20 November 1593 is disputed by some sources because of a supposedly signed Adoration of the Shepherds dated 1595. Bol’s most important students included his stepson Frans Boels, Jacob Savery and Joris Hoefnagel.


"
558,"BOLDINI, Giovanni","(b. 1842, Ferrara, d. 1931, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boldini/biograph.html,"
Italian portrait painter and printmaker. Having worked in Florence and London, he reached his peak of creativity and success in Paris."
559,"BOLDRINI, Niccolò","(b. ca. 1500, Vicenza, d. ca. 1570, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boldrini/biograph.html,"
Italian woodcutter, frequently confused with Niccolò Vicentino. His woodcuts are chiefly after Titian, who may have been his master. He also made woodcuts after Dürer.


"
560,"BOLGI, Andrea","(b. 1605, Carrara, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bolgi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor from Carrara (called il Carrarino). He first trained under Pietro Tacca in Florence. In 1626, together with Francesco Baratta, he moved to Rome, where he entered the studio of Gianlorenzo Bernini and was put to work on the models for the angels on top of the Baldacchino in St Peter's. In 1629, at the age of 24, Bolgi was well enough respected to be given one of the most important commissions in Rome, the execution of the statue of St Helena, one of the four colossal marble statues in the piers under the cupola of St Peter's; the other three were executed by Bernini, Francesco Duquesnoy and Francesco Mochi (all in situ). Bolgi spent almost ten years (1629-39) on this statue, but it was very poorly received. Offended by the criticism, he moved to Naples (before 1653), where he sculpted a number of marble portrait busts, including Francesco Antonio de Caro and Giovanni Camillo Cace (both Naples, S Lorenzo Maggiore)."
561,"BOLLANDT, Heinrich","(b. 1577, Bayreuth, d. ca. 1651, Bayreuth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bollandt/biograph.html,"
Heinrich Bollandt (also Polland), German painter. He was one of the most important artists of the Brandenburg-Bayreuther Renaissance, active mainly in Bayreuth, but also in Lübeck and Berlin. He painted portraits and altarpieces and worked in a style that seems almost archaic and evidently depended on the art of Lucas Cranach the Elder. 



"
562,"BOLLONGIER, Hans","(b. ca. 1600, Haarlem, d. ca. 1675, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bollongi/biograph.html,"
Hans Bollongier (or Boulenger), Dutch painter of Haarlem. He specialised in painting still-lifes of flowers, although he also painted genre pieces. Floral still-life was the speciality of many artists in the early half of the seventeenth century, although Bollongier appears to have had no rivals in Haarlem. Bollongier's work reveals little contemporary influence. Compared to other painters of floral still-lifes, he employed loose, forceful brushstrokes. His paintings also feature a powerful contrast between dark and light.



"
563,"BOLSWERT, Boetius Adamsz.","(b. ca. 1580, Bolsward, d. 1633, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bolswert/boetius/biograph.html,"
Boetius à Bolswert, Dutch engraver, part of a family of engravers, the elder brother and instructor of the engraver Schelte Bolswert. His first dated engraving, Interior of the Exchange in Amsterdam (1609), was published by the Amsterdam publisher Michiel Colyn. Boetius Bolswert executed four engravings of the Horrors of the Spanish War after David Vinckboons (1610) and several series after Abraham Bloemaert, with whom he must have had a close relationship (e.g. Pastorals, 1611, and Saints and Hermits, 1612). In his technique, he conscientiously conveyed the sketchy and mannered style of Bloemaert. In large landscapes after Vinckboons and Gillis van Coninxloo III, Bolswert used a denser, more diffuse style (e.g. Village Fair on a Market-place). In 1615 and 1616 the Dutch States-General licensed Boetius to produce portraits after Michiel Miereveld. In 1618 he depicted the ceremonial funeral-bed of the newly-deceased Philipp Wilhelm, Prince of Orange."
564,"BOLSWERT, Schelte Adamsz.","(b. ca. 1586, Bolsward, d. 1659, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bolswert/schelte/biograph.html,"
Schelte Adamsz. (à) Bolswert, Dutch engraver, younger brother of Boetius Adamsz. (à) Bolswert, also an engraver. He joined the Guild in Antwerp in 1625-26, and under the supervision of Rubens he became the greatest engraver of the Flemish school. Boetius engraved from Rubens towards the close of his life. After the death of his brother, Schelte engraved more than sixty compositions of Rubens, of the most varied character, including hunting scenes and landscapes.

565,"BOLTRAFFIO, Giovanni Antonio",(1467-1516),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boltraff/biograph.html,"Italian painter, the the best of Leonardo's Milanese followers. Most of his works are in Milan, but others are in Berlin, Budapest, Cambridge Mass. (Fogg), Florence (Uffizi), London (National Gallery), New York (Metropolitan Museum), Paris (Louvre and Jacquemart-André) and Philadelphia (Johnson). An interesting portrait by him is at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, and another, in Washington (National Gallery of Art), may have been worked on by Leonardo.



"
566,"BOMBELLI, Sebastiano","(b. 1635, Udine, d. 1719, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bombelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was perhaps the most influential Italian portrait painter of the later 17th century. His early style was formed by his father, Valentino Bombelli, a painter in Udine, and his godfather, the Mannerist artist Girolamo Lugaro. In the early 1660s he was in Venice, where he responded passionately to the brilliant colour, painterly freedom and naturalism of 16th-century Venetian artists, particularly Veronese, whose works he copied. According to Sandrart, who in 1683 provided the first significant report of Bombelli's earliest activities, the artist was initially known as a history painter in the manner of Veronese, although no such painting by him has been identified. Later he became a successful portraitist and enjoyed a status in Venice which was almost that of official portrait painter. He painted several ceremonial portraits.


"
567,"BON, Bartolomeo",(active 1421-1464 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bon/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Venetian sculptor and architect. With his father, Giovanni, he ran the most successful Venetian sculpture workshop of the period. Father and son took on a number of joint commissions until Giovanni’s death, but the latter’s contribution seems to have been a minor one. Attributions to Giovanni and Bartolomeo are many and so diverse that no consensus has been reached on their oeuvre."
568,"BON, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1355, Bergamo, d. ca. 1443, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bon/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Venetian sculptor and architect. With his son, Bartolomeo, he ran the most successful Venetian sculpture workshop of the period. Father and son took on a number of joint commissions until Giovanni’s death, but the latter’s contribution seems to have been a minor one. Attributions to Giovanni and Bartolomeo are many and so diverse that no consensus has been reached on their oeuvre. A complete lack of secure attributions to Giovanni has meant that there is no reliable basis for a reconstruction and appraisal of his career."
569,BONANNO DA PISA,(active late 12th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonanno/biograph.html,"He made the bronze doors of Pisa Cathedral in 1179 but they were destroyed in 1595. The side door of the Cathedral (Porta di S. Ranieri) is attributed to him, as it is identical in style with the bronze doors of Monreale Cathedral, signed by him and dated 1185 (New Style). The other bronze doors at Monreale are by Barisanus.



"
570,"BONASONE, Giulio","(b. ca. 1510, Bologna, d. after 1576, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonasone/biograph.html,"
Italian printmaker and painter. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Sabbatini and evidently a late follower of Marcantonio Raimondi. He is now credited with 410 prints. They include reproductive as well as original prints, and his independence of vision makes him one of the most interesting interpreters of his time. His activity in this field began c. 1531, as is indicated by the date on the Raphaelesque St Cecilia. Parmigianino entrusted him with the copper engraving of his drawings, for example Mercury and Minerva. While in Rome c. 1544-47 Bonasone interpreted works including Michelangelo's Last Judgment and Raphael's Toilet of Psyche. He often combined the techniques of etching and engraving in the same print.



"
571,"BONAVIA, Carlo",(active 1751-1788 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonavia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. Little is known about his life, he is thought to be from Rome, but worked in Naples from about 1751 to 1788. He was trained in the Neapolitan landscape tradition of Salvator Rosa and Leonardo Coccorante (1680-1750), but was much more strongly influenced by the work of Claude-Joseph Vernet, who visited Naples in 1737 and 1746. Bonavia borrowed from Vernet not only subject and viewpoint (sometimes to the extent of almost copying) but even the way in which he applied colour to the canvas. The resultant landscapes are full of chromatic tones and accents, emotional in feeling and far removed from the cold and analytical representations other vedutisti of the period as Antonio Joli and Pietro Fabris."
572,"BONAVÍA, Santiago","(b. 1705, Piacenza, d. 1759, Aranjuez)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonavia1/biograph.html,"
Santiago Bonavía (Italian: Giacomo Bonavia), Italian architect and decorator, active in Spain. Called in 1731 by King Philip V of Spain, Cardinal Infante Luis of Chinchón commissioned him in 1739 the construction of the Church of Sts. Justus and Pastor in Madrid, today's Pontifical Basilica of Saint Michael. In 1743 he was appointed master of the cathedral of Toledo, and in 1748, he was in charge of the reconstruction the royal palace of Aranjuez destroyed by a fire. In addition, also in the same royal site, he was in charge of the completion and interior decoration of the church of Alpajés, with the collaboration of Alejandro González Velázquez (1719-1772), and, alone, the church of San Antonio, attached to the residential complex. But perhaps the most important effort of Bonavía in Aranjuez is the project of urbanization of the locality, demolishing the old houses, unifying the new ones and creating axes that leave the palace and the houses of offices in several directions."
573,"BONAZZA, Giovanni","(b. 1654, Venezia, d. 1736, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonazza/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. Active in Padua in the first half of the 18th century, the family was founded by Giovanni Bonazza, a prolific artist who ran a busy workshop and was an important master for his sons. His eldest son, Tommaso Bonazza (c. 1696-1775), often collaborated with his father and with his brother, Antonio Bonazza (1698-1763), his art remaining close to that of Giovanni. Francesco Bonazza (d Venice, 1770), who was probably born in Venice, worked as a sculptor and as a painter, mosaicist and engraver of cameos. He appears to have been the least involved in his father's workshop, although his style remains close to that of Giovanni and of his brothers. Antonio Bonazza was the most brilliant of Giovanni's sons and one of the most original 18th-century Venetian sculptors. The only documented activity of his brother Michelangelo Bonazza (1704-1768) is his collaboration with Tommaso on statues on the portal of S Maria del Carmine, Padua. The Bonazza family had numerous pupils, who created a school at Padua that remained active until the end of the 18th century and influenced the young Antonio Canova."
574,"BONDOL, Jean",(active 1368-1381 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bondol/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter and miniaturist active in France. His name is spelled in various ways (Boudolf, Bandolf, and so on) and he is also known as Jean de Bruges, presumably indicating his birthplace. He is first recorded in 1368 in the service of Charles V of France, an ardent bibliophile. His only known signed work is the dedicatory miniature (1371) in a Bible historiale (a French translation of a Latin compilation of biblical history and legend) made for Charles (Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum, The Hague). The only other work that can be confidently attributed to him is the design of the celebrated series of tapestries on the Apocalypse (woven 1373-82, Musée des Tapisseries, Angers), made for Louis I, Duke of Anjou, Charles V's brother."
575,"BONE, Henry","(b. 1755, Truro, d. 1834, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bone/biograph.html,"
English enamel painter. He was much employed by London jewellers for small designs in enamel, before his merits as an artist were well known to the public. In 1800 the beauty of his pieces attracted the notice of the Royal Academy, of which he was then admitted as an associate; in 1811 he was made an academician. Up to 1831 he executed many beautiful miniature pieces of much larger size than had been attempted before in England; among these his eighty-five portraits of the time of Queen Elizabeth, of different sizes, from 13 by 10 to 33 by 20 cm are most admired. They were disposed of by public sale after his death. His Bacchus and Ariadne, after Titian, painted on a plate, brought the great price of 2200 guineas.



"
576,"BONECHI, Matteo","(b. 1669, Firenze, d. 1756, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonechi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draftsman. He was a prolific artist, most successful as a fresco painter, who worked mainly in and around Florence. His early years are undocumented, and it is not clear with whom he trained; perhaps Francesco Botti (1640-1710) or Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani (1660-1731) was his teacher. He was certainly strongly influenced by Sagrestani, from whom he may have found it difficult to free himself. The works of his maturity, however, are highly personal and reflect the carefree mood of 18th-century Florence, which responded to the lighter influences of the French Rococo."
577,"BONFIGLI, Benedetto","(b. ca. 1420, Perugia, d. 1496, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonfigli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was almost certainly trained in Perugia between 1430 and 1440, where a Late Gothic style was still dominant. Subsequently he was influenced by Fra Angelico, whose polyptych (Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Perugia) for San Domenico, Perugia, was commissioned in 1437, and more importantly by Domenico Veneziano, who worked in that city c. 1438. The influence of Domenico Veneziano and of Gentile da Fabriano can be seen in Bonfigli's earliest surviving work, a polyptych (now dismembered), which had a central panel of the Virgin and Child (El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso), shown against a densely wooded background, and St Sebastian and a Bishop Saint (Montserrat Museum, Montserrat) on one wing. Another wing (untraced) shows St Bernardino of Siena and St Anthony Abbot."
578,"BONHEUR, Isidore Jules","(b. 1827, Bordeaux, d. 1901, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonheur/isidore/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter, known as one of the most distinguished 19th-century French animalier sculptors. He began his career as an artist working with his elder sister Rosa Bonheur in the studio of their father, drawing instructor Raymond Bonheur. Initially working as a painter, Isidore Jules Bonheur made his Salon debut in 1848."
579,"BONHEUR, Rosa","(b. 1822, Bordeaux, d. 1899, Thomery)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonheur/rosa/biograph.html,"
French painter and sculptor, best known for her paintings of animals. She received her training from her father, Raymond Bonheur (1796-1849), an artist and ardent Saint-Simonian who encouraged her artistic career and independence. Precocious and talented, she began making copies in the Louvre at the age of 14 and first exhibited at the Salon in 1841. Her sympathetic portrayal of animals was influenced by prevailing trends in natural history and her deep affinity for animals, especially horses."
580,BONIFACIO VERONESE,"(b. 1487, Verona, d. 1557, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonifaci/biograph.html,"Italian painter, originally Bonifazio de' Pitati. He was born in Verona but trained under Palma Vecchio and ran a large workshop in Venice. His style was greatly influenced by Giorgione and Titian, and to some extent his name is used to cover works which the owner dare not quite attribute to either of them, but there is a fine picture in Birmingham which is closer to Bassano. Other examples are in Adelaide, Boston, Dresden, Florence (Pitti, Uffizi), London (National Gallery), Milan (Brera and Ambrosiana), San Francisco, Venice and Vienna. There are also many cassoni and furniture decorations attributed to him. He had a lasting influence on Tintoretto.


"
581,"BONIFACIO, Natale","(b. 1538, Sibenik, d. 1592, Sibenik)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonifacn/biograph.html,"
Natale Bonifacio da Sebenico, Dalmatian printmaker. Very little is known of his life. In the 1570s he is documented as traveling to Venice, where he published some maps. From there in 1575 - in conjunction with the opening of the Holy Year - he moved to Rome. He engraved the plates drawn by Giovanni Guerra for Dominico Fontana in 1586 illustrating the transportation of the Vatican obelisk. The plates are signed ""Natalis Bonifacius Sibenicensis fec.""



"
582,"BONINGTON, Richard Parkes","(b. 1802, Arnold, d. 1828, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boningto/biograph.html,"
English painter, active mainly in France, where his family moved when he was 15. In 1819 he went to Paris, where he became a pupil of Gros and formed a friendship with  Delacroix. He was influenced by the medievalism and orientalism of the French Romantics and produced paintings in their manner. However, he established his reputation as a landscapist, particularly with his works exhibited at the Salon of 1822 and the so-called 'English' Salon of 1824, at which his own paintings (which won him a gold medal) and those of Constable were the star attractions."
583,BONINO DA CAMPIONE,(active 1350-1390 in Lombardy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His name indicates that he was born in - or into a family originating in - Campione d'Italia, a Lombardy town in an enclave within Switzerland. His main work is the Gothic monument to Cansignorio della Scala (1376) at Santa Maria Antica, Verona, which is part of the Scaleri tombs, the monuments to the important members of the Scaliger family, lords of Verona."
584,"BONITO, Giuseppe","(b. 1707, Castellamare di Stabia, d. 1789, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonito/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A student of Francesco Solimena, Bonito became one of the most influential artists of the Neapolitan school in the 18th century. Throughout his career, but most notably during the latter part of the century when Rome was the arbiter of Neo-classicism, his style remained firmly within the rich painterly traditions of Naples. His earliest works, for example the Archangel Raphael and Tobias (1730; Santa Maria Maggiore, Naples), show an assimilation of elements derived from late Baroque artists working in Naples and a hesitant affinity to the tenebrism of Solimena. In other pictures of sacred subjects from c. 1730 onwards, however, he developed a personal neo-Baroque style characterized by sweeping movement, bold chiaroscuro and a saturated palette reminiscent of both Solimena and Luca Giordano. Paintings in this style, such as St Vincent Ferrer (1737; San Domenico, Barletta), St Lazarus (early 1740s; San Ciro, Portici) and Charity (1742; Palazzo Monte di Pietà, Naples), show that Bonito's maturity was also characterized by delicacy and grace.

English architect of Italian decent, born as Giuseppe Bonomi in Rome. He was educated at the Collegio Romano and then studied architecture with Girolamo Teodoli (1677-1766). He made his early reputation in Rome before moving to London in 1767 at the invitation of Robert and James Adam (1732-1794), who employed him as a draughtsman from 1768. In his early years in England Bonomi also worked as an assistant to Thomas Leverton (1743-1824)."
588,"BONSI, Giovanni",(active 1351-1375 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonsi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was influential in Florentine painting around the 1350s and his oeuvre is stylistically close to the works of Maso di Banco and the Master of San Lucchese, Allegretto Nuzi and Andrea da Firenze (Andrea di Bonaiuto.)"
589,"BONSIGNORE, Ferdinando","(b. 1760, Torino, d. 1843, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonsign/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He was a student of the Accademia di Pittura e Scultura di Torino in 1782, and from 1783-1798 he was given a scholarship to Rome by the King of Sardinia. In Rome he worked with Nicola Giansimoni (died 1800), a Neoclassicist architect. In 1798, he returned to Turin and was nominated architect and designer to the court. He became professor of architecture at the University in 1805. In 1813 he received a gold medal for his design of a Monument to Napoleon on the hill of Moncenisio. He kept his university position after the restoration, as well as numerous other awards and appointments. He helped design the church of Gran Madre di Dio in Turin."
590,"BONSIGNORI, Francesco","(b. 1455, Verona, d. 1519, Caldiero)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonsigno/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His father, Albertus Bonsignori, was reputedly an amateur painter; and besides Francesco, the oldest and most talented of his children, three other sons, including Bernardino (c. 1476-c. 1520) and Girolamo (b. c. 1479), are also recorded as painters. Barely 20 paintings and fewer than a dozen drawings have been attributed to Francesco Bonsignori. Documents from his time at the Gonzaga court in Mantua and Vasari's account of his life are the main sources for information on the artist."
591,"BONTEMPS, Pierre",(active 1536-1567),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bontemps/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, first documented in 1536 as an assistant to Primaticcio at Fontainebleau. By 1550 he was in Paris, working on two important monuments for the royal burial church at S. Denis - the reclining effigies and bas-reliefs for the tomb of Francis I, designed by the great architect Philibert Delorme, and the monument for the heart of Francis I. Only one other work is documented as being by him-the tomb of Charles de Maigny (1557) in the Louvre - but other works of the period are confidently attributed to him on stylistic evidence, and he seems to have been the foremost French tomb sculptor of the mid 16th century. His style was elegant and decorative.



"

Ambrogio, Bonvicino (also Buonvicino), Italian sculptor and stuccoist. From Milan, where he belonged to the circle of Lombard and Ticino sculptors with naturalistic indecencies, In 1581, he moved to Rome working mainly under the papacy of Sixtus V and Paul V in late Mannerist style. He received his most important commissions in the time of Pope Paul V: the bas-relief above the main door of St. Peter's Basilica depicting the Delivery of the Keys to Peter and two reliefs with stories of Clement VIII and Paul V and statue of St Joseph in the Cappella Paolina, Santa Maria Maggiore."
593,"BONZI, Pietro Paolo","(ca. 1576, Cortona, d. 1636, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bonzi/biograph.html,"Italian painter, called Il Gobbo dei Frutti or Il Gobbo dei Carracci (il Gobbo meaning ""the hunchback""). According to Giovanni Baglione, Bonzi soon moved from Cortona to Rome and settled in the household of the Crescenzi, where with their support he became a painter of still-lifes. He was so talented at this new trade that he earned the nickname ""Gobbo dei frutti"". Two works bear his signature: Fruit, Vegetables and a Butterfly, signed ""P. Paolo di Cortona"", and a lost Still-life. Grouped on tiered ledges, his crisply painted compositions anticipate those of the Neapolitan painters of the following decades, such as Luca Forte and Giovan Battista Ruoppolo.
"
594,"BOONEN, Arnold","(b. 1669, Dordrecht, d. 1729, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boonen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He began his training at the age of 13 with the painter Arold Verbuys (1673-1717) and in 1683 was apprenticed to the portrait and genre painter Godfried Schalcken (at that time working in Dordrecht), with whom he remained for six years. After working as an independent painter in Dordrecht, he travelled to Germany, where he had considerable success as a portrait painter in Frankfurt-am-Main, Mainz and Darmstadt. He settled in Amsterdam in 1696, shortly after his return to the Netherlands, and worked successfully as a portrait and genre painter. He succeeded Nicolas Maes as the leading painter of fashionable society and visiting dignitaries, including the Tsar Peter the Great of Russia.



"
595,"BOR, Paulus","(b. 1605, Amersfoort, d. 1669, Amersfoort)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bor/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He came from a prominent and wealthy Catholic family. In 1577 his grandfather Bor Jansz. was a member of the Treffelicxte, a group of the most exceptional citizens of Amersfoort. His father, also named Paulus Bor, was a textile merchant. Coming from a wealthy family he probably did not need to paint for an income. This might explain his preference for subjects rarely painted by other artists, such as Ovide' tale of Cydippe, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and also why his depictions of single and sometimes melancholic female figures strike us as unusual."
596,"BORCHT, Hendrik van der, the Elder","(b. 1583, Bruxelles, d. 1651, Frankfurt am Main)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borcht/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, engraver, and archaeologist, active in Germany and Italy. He went to Germany with his family in 1586, and in Frankenthal he was the student of Gillis van Valckenborch (1570-1622) and Marten van Valckenborch (1535-1612). Between 1604 and 1610 he was in Italy, probably in Rome. He lived in Frankenthal from 1610 to 1627, when he settled in Frankfurt am Main. His speciality was the still-life."
597,"BORDONE, Benedetto","(b. ca. 1460, Padova, d. 1539, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bordon/biograph.html,"
Italian manuscript editor, miniaturist and cartographer. He was definitely in Venice by 1494, when he was granted a privilege to publish his Italian translation of the Dialogues of Lucian. He was an astrologer, miniaturist, illuminator, cartographer and engraver from Padua, but worked and died in Venice on April 10, 1539. He is best known for the Isolario, an island book (a genre that was in vogue in Italy at the time) entitled Libro de Benedetto Bordone, nel qual si ragiona de tutte l'isole del mondo. It was published in Venice in 1528 and contained 111 woodcut maps. In this book he describes all the islands of the known world with their folklore, myths, cultures, climates, situations, and history; it was intended as an illustrated guide for sailors and attempts to include all the new transatlantic discoveries.



"
598,"BORDONE, Paris","(b. 1500, Treviso, d. 1571, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bordone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was from Treviso, but by 1518 he had settled in Venice. Vasari says he was a pupil of Titian, but found his teaching disagreeable and soon left (Titian is then said to have stolen his first commission). Whatever the truth of these stories, Bordone's work was certainly strongly influenced by Titian and also by Giorgione, 'for that master's style pleased him exceedingly' (Vasari)."
599,BORGHESE DI PIERO BORGHESE,"(b. 1397, Lucca, d. ca. 1463)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borghese/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was active in Pisa between 1420 and 1429, then in Lucca where in 1447 he became a citizen of the city. Formerly his works were ascribed to a Master of Saints Cyrus and Juliet (Santi Quirico e Giulitta). He was identified as Borghese di Piero Borghese in 1965 by Roberto Longhi after reviewing three predella scenes belonging to the triptych The Story of Saints Julitta and Quiricus (Courtauld Gallery, London). The predella scenes show the martyrdom of these two saints.

600,"BORGIANNI, Orazio","(b. 1574, Roma, d. 1616, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borgiann/biograph.html,"Recently discovered documents have shed new light on the career of Orazio Borgianni, who worked in Rome and Spain at the turn of the seventeenth century. He is recorded in Spain by 1598, although he might have arrived a year earlier, and continued to work there until c. 1605-06. Under the influence of works by El Greco and Jacopo Tintoretto, in Spain Borgianni executed The Crucifixion (Museo Provincial de Belles Artes, Cadiz) and The Stigmatisation of Sr Francis (Museo del Prado, Madrid).

"
601,"BORGOÑA, Juan de","(active from 1495, Toledo, d. 1535, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borgona/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. His name indicates that he came from northern France, and he is first documented as working in the cloister of Toledo Cathedral in 1495. His arrival in Spain coincided with that of Juan de Flandes. Both painters were connected with Pedro Berruguete, which suggests that the three had met previously, in either Flanders or Italy. Borgoña's style indicates that he had studied painting in Italy, but it also contains traces of Flemish sensibility. The influence of Domenico Ghirlandaio and Gerard David is discernible, and the influence of Piero della Francesca and Melozzo da Forli in Borgoña's treatment of light can be observed. Castilian elements feature in his work, notably the use of gold backgrounds and a wealth of decoration. Borgoña's compositions are finely balanced, like those of the Italian High Renaissance, with skilfully drawn figures portrayed in elegant, tranquil poses. They are set against open spaces leading on to craggy landscapes reminiscent of Umbria or against gold embroidered drapery.

Italian painter. He had his artistic training in Florence in the workshop of Gaetano Bianchi, specialized in the restoration of works of art, where he participated in the restoration of the Green Cloister of Santa Maria Novella. In 1853 he attended the Academy of Fine Arts where he was a pupil of Enrico Pollastrini. Here, he was oriented towards a painting of history with strong references to the Florentine Quattrocento. He also made drawings from life in the countryside around Florence with Telemaco Signorini and Vincenzo Cabianca. In 1859 he participated in the second war of independence with other Tuscan volunteers in Calcinato and Modena."
604,"BORRÁS, Fray Nicolás","(b. 1530, Cocentaina, d. 1610, Gandía)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borras/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Going to Valencia at an early age to study under Vicente Joanes, he became that master's most noteworthy pupil. His works in general resemble those of Joanes and some of them are good enough to have been taken for the master's. Entering the priesthood, he was assigned to his native place, where he devoted all his spare moments to painting and acquired such skill that the authorities of the monastery, St Jerome at Gandía, employed him to paint the picture for the high altar of their church. He enjoyed his stay at the monastery so much, that taking a great liking to the brothers and their life he determined to ask for no other payment for his work than membership in the order. He received the habit in 1575, and took the final vows the following year. Three years thereafter, Fra Nicolás spent some time with the Capuchins at the Franciscan monastery of San Juan de la Riviera near Valencia. He was soon back, however, at Gandía where he spent the rest of his life painting in every part of the monastery, in the chuch, chief chapel, chapter house, oratories, refectories, and cloisters, leaving twelve altar pieces in the church alone. He also spent his own money in the employment of sculptors and builders for the embellishment of his beloved monastery."
605,"BORRASSA, Lluis","(b. ca. 1360, Gerona, d. 1425, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borrassa/biograph.html,"
Catalan painter, active in Barcelona and its neighbourhood from 1388 to 1424. His work shows French and Sienese influences and is representative of the International Gothic style. Several of his documented works survive, for example the great composite altarpiece of Sta Clara, executed 1412-15, now in Vich Museum, Barcelona.



"
606,"BORROMINI, Francesco","(b. 1599, Bissone, d. 1667, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borromin/biograph.html,"
Italian architect of Swiss origin (original name Francesco Castelli). He was the son and student of Giovanni Domenico Castelli, a builder in the service of the Visconti family of Milan. He took his mother's maiden name of Borromini to distinguish himself from numerous Castelli relatives."
607,"BORSATO, Giuseppe","(b. 1770, Venezia, d. 1849, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borsato/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and decorative artist in the Neo-Classical style, active in Venice, last of the great Venetian decorators. He was commissioned by Eugène de Beauharnais in 1807 to coordinate the ornamentation of the halls of the royal palace in the Procuratie Nuove. In the interior Borsato produced a personal and very careful interpretation of the Empire style, clearly influenced by the French architects and interior decorators Percier and Fontaine and the Biedermeier style that then prevailed in most of the major royal courts of Europe."
608,"BORSOS, József","(b. 1821, Veszprém, d. 1883, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borsos/biograph.html,"
Hungarian portrait painter. He finished his studies in Vienna where he attracted much attention. His portraits of distinguished contemporaries and his elaborate genre pictures were highly successful, e.g. Wine, Woman, Love (1847), and Girls after the Ball (1850). His typically biedermeier colours, realistic, strong and delicate, and his harmonic compositions made him popular with the public patronizing art in Pest. After losing his money on the Stock Exchange, he moved from Vienna to Pest in 1861. Unable to compete with fotography, he opened a photographic studio and died as the owner of the restaurant Szép Juhászné. His works: Alms, Sunset, The Letter, Grapes or a Kiss, National Guard, Bathing Women, The Portrait of Zitterbach, an Architect, The Portrait of Ferenc Pulszky, and Pigeon Post.


"
609,"BORSSUM, Anthonie van","(b. 1631, Amsterdam, d. 1677, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/borssum/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. There are no surviving documents to support the common assumption that he was a pupil of Rembrandt, although some of his drawings show the influence of Rembrandt's landscape etchings of the 1640s. These compositions always followed a particular formula: water in the foreground, a farm, windmill or ramshackle barn among trees in the middle ground and, to one side, a distant view of buildings below a low skyline. Various landscapes with windmills bearing the signature AVBorssom have these characteristics (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum; Dresden, Kupferstichkabinet; Frankfurt am Main, Städelsches Kunstinstitut)."
610,"BORT, Jaime","(d. 1754, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bort/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. He was born in San Mateo, Castellón, although the exact date is not known."
611,"BORTOLONI, Mattia","(b. 1696, Canda, d. 1750, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bortolin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, trained in Venice under the guidance of Antonio Balestra. His known first works are the frescoes of the Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese. In Venice he was active as a fresco painter in the  palaces Contarini-Sceriman (1727) and Farsetti and executes the ceiling with the Glory of San Gaetano (before 1732) in the church of San Nicola da Tolentino."
612,"BOS, Cornelis","(b. ca. 1510, 's Hertogenbosch, d. ca. 1566, Groningen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bos/biograph.html,"
Cornelis Bos (also spelt Bosch, or Sylvius Bus), Flemish printmaker. In 1540 he was registered as a citizen of Antwerp and became a member of the city's Guild of St Luke, although it is possible he was in the city for some time before this date. His first known engraving is Prudence and Justice (1537) after Maarten van Heemskerck. There are several engravings based on Classical statues (e.g. Laokoon, 1548) and the work of Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano, suggesting that Bos may have gone to Rome some time before 1540. It is, however, possible that Bos copied the Italian originals from drawings or prints brought back from Italy by other artists."
613,"BOSCH, Hieronymus","(b. ca. 1450, 's-Hertogenbosch, d. 1516, 's-Hertogenbosch)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosch/biograph.html,"

Netherlandish painter, named after the town of 's-Hertogenbosch (Bois-le-Duc) in northern Brabant, where he seems to have lived throughout his life. His real name was Jerome van Aken (perhaps indicating family origins in Aachen, Germany). Bosch married well and was successful in his career (although his town was fairly isolated, it was prosperous and culturally stimulating). He was an orthodox Catholic and a prominent member of a local religious brotherhood, but his most characteristic paintings are so bizarre that in the 17th century he was reputed to have been a heretic. About forty genuine examples of Bosch's work survive, but none is dated and no accurate chronology can be made.

"
614,"BOSCHETTI, Lorenzo",(active 1709-1772 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boschett/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and mathematician. Little biographical information is known about this architect who was active in Venice between 1709 and 1772 and received there many assignments. In 1709 he presented a model for the implementation of the façade of the church of San Stae. Between 1749 and 1772 he rebuilt the church of San Barnaba, inspired by the Santa Maria del Rosario, built by Giorgio Massari who was probably Boschetti's master. "
615,"BOSCOLI, Tommaso di Pietro","(b. 1503, Fiesole, d. 1574, Montepulciano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boscoli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, also called Maso del Bosco. He was the pupil of Andrea Ferrucci (1465-c. 1526), and later Michelangelo. As an architect he was the pupil of Antonio da Sangallo the Elder. After Michelangelo's drawing, he executed the recumbent figure of the pope on the tomb of Julius II (San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome). His group with St Anne, the Virgin and Child and the donor Pietro de Velasco (1544, Santa Maria di Monserrato, Rome) was influenced by similar groups by Andrea Sansovino and Francesco da Sangallo.



"
616,"BOSIO, François-Joseph","(b. 1768, Monaco, d. 1845, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosio/francois/biograph.html,"
French sculptor of Monegasque birth. He trained in Paris in the studio of Augustin Pajou in the period 1785-88. He was an officer in the French army in Italy during the Revolutionary wars, but by 1802 he had resigned his commission. He stayed in Italy, presumably studying and practising as a sculptor until his return to Paris in 1807. Thanks to Lorenzo Bartolini he was employed to work on some of the stone bas-reliefs (1807-10; in situ) for the Colonne de la Grande Armée in the Place Vendôme, Paris. He was also a portraitist to the imperial family. At that time he produced one of his best portrait busts - that of Empress Josephine (Dijon). "
617,"BOSIO, Jean François","(b. 1764, Monaco, d. 1827, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosio/jean/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman, the elder brother of the sculptor François-Joseph Bosio. He  moved to Paris in the second half of the 1780s and there he embarked upon his academic training to become a peintre d'histoire. He became both friend and pupil of the Neoclassical painter, Jacques-Louis David, and exhibited at the Salons of 1793, 1798, 1801 and 1804. He painted biblical and mythological themes, as well as family portraits."
618,"BOSIO, Antonio","(b. 1575, Malta, d. 1629, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosio_a/biograph.html,"
Maltese archaeologist. He moved as a child to Rome, where he eventually became the agent of the Knights of Malta. In 1593 he began an extensive study of the catacombs; his discoveries were published posthumously in 'Roma sotterranea' (1632).



"
619,"BOSSCHAERT, Abraham","(b. ca. 1612, Middelburg, d. 1643, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosschae/abraham/biograph.html,"
Painter, member of a Dutch family of painters of Flemish origin. Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder was one of the first artists to specialize in flower painting in the northern Netherlands. Other members of what has become known as the Bosschaert dynasty of fruit and flower painters include his three sons Ambrosius Bosschaert the Younger, Johannes Bosschaert and Abraham Bosschaert, as well as his brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast and the latter's lesser-known brother Johannes van der Ast."
620,"BOSSCHAERT, Ambrosius the Elder","(b. 1573, Antwerpen, d. 1621, Middleburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosschae/ambrosiu/biograph.html,"
Flemish flower and still-life painter, active mainly in the Netherlands, where he is recorded in Middelburg from 1593 to 1613 and later in the Utrecht Guild in 1616. Although he spent the major part of his life in the Netherlands, Bosschaert's style was basically Flemish - similar to that of Jan Brueghel, with whom he ranks in quality and as one of the pioneers of flower painting as an independent genre. His bouquets have a rich variety of flowers from different seasons arranged in a formal way. The degree of finish and exactitude, and the subtlety of the colour, are exceptional. His Vase of Flowers (Mauritshuis, The Hague, c.1620) is one of the most reproduced of all flower pieces. Bosschaert may fairly be said to have initiated the Dutch tradition of flower painting and his style was continued by his three sons, Ambrosius the Younger, Abraham, and Johannes, and also by his brother-in-law, Balthasar van der Ast.


"
621,"BOSSCHAERT, Ambrosius the Younger","(b. 1609, Arnemuiden, d. 1645, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosschae/ambrosix/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder. He lived in Utrecht, where he married in 1634. His work has been recognized only since 1935 when Piet de Boer succeeded in differentiating it from pictures by his father and his brother Abraham. Ambrosius the Younger's early pictures are signed AB in Gothic lettering, but after 1633 he used a more calligraphic, rounded abbreviation, almost Baroque in effect, or even his name in full."
622,"BOSSCHAERT, Jan-Baptist","(b. 1667, Antwerpen, d. 1746, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosschae/jan_bapt/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a Dutch family of painters of Flemish origin. Ambrosius Bosschaert was one of the first artists to specialize in flower painting in the northern Netherlands. Several generations followed the tradition established by him until the end of the 17th century. Jan-Baptist was a late descendant and one of the last artists of the family.



"
623,"BOSSCHAERT, Johannes","(b. ca. 1610, Middelburg, d. ca. 1650, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosschae/johannes/biograph.html,"
Painter, member of a Dutch family of painters of Flemish origin. Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder was one of the first artists to specialize in flower painting in the northern Netherlands. Other members of what has become known as the Bosschaert dynasty of fruit and flower painters include his three sons Ambrosius Bosschaert the Younger, Johannes Bosschaert and Abraham Bosschaert, as well as his brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast and the latter's lesser-known brother Johannes van der Ast. Johannes Bosschaert seems from an early age to have been a talented painter, whose few surviving works are mostly horizontal in format and strongly influenced by his uncle Balthasar van der Ast. By contrast, Abraham Bosschaert apparently favoured an oval format and was a much less skilled artist, to judge from the equally small number of known paintings by him. It was, in fact, the eldest son and namesake who most closely followed the tradition established by Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, whose activities in Middelburg at the beginning of his career made it the centre of flower painting in the Netherlands. This switched to Utrecht after Ambrosius the Elder's move there in 1616; all of his sons were active in Utrecht, as were van der Ast and other important exponents of the genre (e.g. Roelandt Savery).


"
624,"BOSSCHE, Balthasar van den","(b. 1681, Antwerpen, d. 1715, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bossche/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He studied with the Flemish genre painter Gerard Thomas (1663-1720), and was very much influenced by his teacher's genre style of interior painting, especially his depictions of well-furnished bourgeois rooms and conversation pieces, complete with detailed settings that helped to display his patrons' gentility. He established a reputation for such works, and was fascinated by the presentation of studio interiors and collectors' galleries, with the figures emblematic of the arts."
625,"BOSSE, Abraham","(b. 1602, Paris, d. 1676, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bosse/biograph.html,"
French engraver. His large output (more than 1.500 prints) provides a rich source of documentation on 17th-century French life and manners. Many of his engravings are genre scenes, and even his religious works are in modern dress. Bosse taught perspective at the Académie Royale from its foundation in 1648 until 1661, when he was expelled for quarrelling with his colleagues over his opposition to Le Brun's dogmatic theories. He wrote treatises on engraving, painting, perspective, and architecture and he occasionally painted.



"
626,"BOSSUIT, Francis van","(b. 1635, Bruxelles, d. 1692, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bossuit/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, trained as a sculptor in Antwerp and Brussels. Later, around 1655, he travelled to Italy, where he worked in a number of cities. There Van Bossuit studied Classical art and the work of his Italian contemporaries. In Florence he worked with Balthazar Permoser at the Academy, in Rome he made numerous copies of antique statues and contacted the Bentvueghels group of Netherlandish artists."
627,"BOTH, Andries","(b. ca. 1612, Utrecht, d. 1641, Venice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/both/andries/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter who, according to Sandrart, worked together with his brother Jan (c. 1618-1652). Andries painted the figures in Jan's landscapes. However, no joint works are known which can be recognized as having figures by Andries, and it is difficult to date any of Jan's landscapes before 1641. Signed works as the Boors Carousing (1634, Utrecht) or the Card Players (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) shows as Andries as a painter of Bambocciate in a style closer to Brouwer than to his brother's idyllic landscapes. The brothers were in Italy in 1635 and 1639-41. Andries was drowned in Venice: he fell into a canal on his way home from a party.



"
628,"BOTH, Jan","(b. ca. 1618, Utrecht, d. 1652, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/both/jan/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, with Nicolaes Berchem the most celebrated of the Italianate landscape painters. He came from Utrecht, where he studied with Bloemaert before moving to Italy for a period of about four years, c.1637-41."
629,"BOTTALLA, Giovanni Maria","(b. 1613, Savona, d. 1644, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bottalla/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Il Raffaellino. After receiving a literary education, he was sent by his father to Rome to study painting. There he copied the works of ancient and contemporary artists and came into contact with cardinals Francesco Barberini and Giulio Sacchetti. The latter, who nicknamed him Raffaellino, became his patron, thus allowing him the opportunity of studying with Pietro da Cortona. Bottalla, probably with Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, assisted Cortona with frescoes (1626-29) in the Villa Sacchetti (1625-29) at Castel Fusano, Rome. With the same artists he worked on the frescoed ceiling of the salone of the Palazzo Barberini in Rome, where he almost certainly painted the monochrome parts. His name appears on receipts in the Barberini archives between 1634 and 1639."
630,"BOTTANI, Giuseppe","(b. 1717, Cremona, d. 1784, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bottani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied first in Florence under Antonio Puglieschi and Vincenzo Meucci (1694-1766). In 1735 he settled in Rome where, as a pupil of Agostino Masucci, he deepened his knowledge of the Antique and of the pictorial tradition of the 16th and 17th centuries. His paintings, executed in the classical Baroque style epitomized by Reni and Maratti, are characterized by their erudite composition, precise drawing and enamel-like colours. The large altarpiece of St Paola Leaving for the Holy Land (1745; Milan, Brera) reflects his study of the proto-Neo-classical style prevalent in Rome."
631,"BOTTICELLI, Sandro","(b. 1445, Florence, d. 1510, Florence)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/botticel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born Alessandro di Moriano Filipepi, Botticelli is one of the outstanding geniuses in the history of Western art. He began his training under Filippo Lippi, alongside Filippino, and seemingly worked for a time with Leonardo in Verrocchio's workshop. He was influenced by the Pollaiuoli for a short time around 1470, when he painted a Fortitude to go with a set of six other Virtues by Piero Pollaiuolo (all seven now in the Uffizi). His understanding of perspective and foreshortening, of architectural design and, indeed, of anatomy, were all that might have been expected of a man with such a background, but it is to the pure visual poetry of the outcome that he owes his fame. His manipulations of the visual facts for artistic purposes should no more be put down to ignorance or inability in these respects than in the case of Picasso in the 20 century. Although he was a superb colourist, delicate at times, strong at others, and capable, in his last years, of harsh and powerful effects, the essence of his art lies in the unsurpassed, singing quality of his line. This can be seen at its purest in the series of splendid outline drawings with which he illustrated Dante's Divine comedy (Staatliche Museen, Berlin; Vatican, Rome). These drawings, made probably in the 1490s, show his sensitive feeling for contour at its most subtle.

The son of a painter of playing cards, Botticini was apprenticed in 1459 to the successful Florentine painter Bicci di Neri. From 1471 he was a meber of the Confraternity of the Archangel Raphael at Santo Spirito, and in 1472 he was inscribed in the Confraternity of St Luke."
633,"BOTTICINI, Raffaello","(b. 1477, Firenze, d. ca. 1520, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/botticin/raffaell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son and pupil of the painter Francesco Botticini. However, his style was different, he was influenced by Perugino and Domenico Ghirlandaio. His style is occasionally reminiscent of that of Lorenzo di Credi.


"
634,"BOUCHARDON, Edmé","(b. 1698, Chaumont, d. 1762, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouchard/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, whose work marks the beginning of the Neoclassical reaction against the Rococo style. From 1723 to 1732 he worked in Rome, where he made a marble bust of the antiquarian Philippe Stosch (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1727) that is very consciously in the antique manner. Although his style later softened somewhat, notably in the famous Cupid Making a Bow from Hercules' Club (Louvre, Paris, 1750), it remained too severe for court taste."
635,"BOUCHER, Alfred","(b. 1850, Bouy-sur-Ovin, d. 1934, Aix-les-Bains)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouche/biograph.html,"

He was for a short time a pupil of François Lemoyne and in his early years was closely connected with Watteau, many of whose pictures he engraved. In 1727-31 he was in Italy, and on his return was soon busy as a versatile fashionable artist. His career was hugely successful and he received many honours, becoming Director of the Gobelins factory in 1755 and Director of the Academy and King's Painter in 1765. He was also the favourite artist of Louis XV's most famous mistress, Mme de Pompadour, to whom he gave lessons and whose portrait he painted several times (Wallace Collection, London; National Gallery, Edinburgh).

Pierre (Pieter) van Boucle (Boeckel, Bouck, Boucken), Flemish painter, active in France. He may have studied still-life painting with Frans Snyders in Flanders, but by 1629 he was in Paris, where he settled in the community of Flemish painters in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés district, which lay outside the jurisdiction of the Painters' Guild (Maîtrise). For some time he worked with the still-life painter Lubin Baugin in the studio of Simon Vouet, where they produced cartoons for tapestries (untraced). He probably also had contacts with the still-life painters Jacques Linard and Louise Moillon, with whose style his work has affinities."

There he executed, among other works, a model in wax of the royal arms for the façade of the Palazzo Mancini, home of the Académie de France, and a marble copy of the Spinario (untraced). He also contributed to the sculptural decoration of S Giovanni in Laterano (Lateran Basilica). In 1741 he was in Naples and in Venice, where he may have modelled the powerful bust of Father Lodolli (terracotta, 1744; St Petersburg, Hermitage)."

By 1669 he had fled to Paris, where he met fellow Flemings, Pieter Boel, Abraham Genoels, Adam Frans van der Meulen and Jan van Hughtenburgh, and where he was mainly active as an engraver. He engraved van der Meulen's Battles of Louis XIV and numerous works by Genoels, van Hughtenburgh and by himself. These prints combine bold execution with careful attention to detail."

French landscape painter, son of a sea captain who settled in Le Havre in 1835. He met artists through his father's stationery and framing shop, which also sold artists' supplies. Jean-Baptiste Isabey, Constant Troyon and Jean-François Millet would come by and offer the young Boudin advice. In 1850, Boudin received a scholarship to study art in Paris. In 1859, he met Gustave Courbet and poet/art critic Charles Baudelaire, who took an interest in his work. That year Boudin submitted his work to the Salon for the first time and was accepted."

French cabinetmaker, active in Paris, a specialist in floral marquetry. He came from a very modest family. Early in his career he worked with the merchant-cabinetmaker Pierre Migeon who provided furniture with floral inlays or varnish the way of Chinese lacquer. He became master cabinetmaker in 1761 and opened his own store in 1772. Later he worked together with Topino, Denizot or Gilbert; sometimes a double stamp confirms collaboration.



"
643,"BOUGH, Samuel","(b. 1822, Carlisle, d. 1878, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bough/biograph.html,"
English painter. Although born in England, Bough became one of the most influential figures in the development of nineteenth-century Scottish landscape painting. A largely self-taught artist, he spent the early part of his career in Manchester and Glasgow painting scenes for theatrical sets. Bough later dedicated himself to landscape painting, and became adept at illustrating the fleeting effects of weather. This is especially clear in his paintings of Cadzow Forest in South Lanarkshire. He settled in Edinburgh in 1855, and was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Academy the following year."
644,"BOUGUEREAU, William-Adolphe","(b. 1825, La Rochelle, d. 1905, La Rochelle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouguere/biograph.html,"
French painter. In 1846 he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in the studio of François-Edouard Picot. This was the beginning of the standard academic training of which he became so ardent a defender later in life. He won the Prix de Rome in 1850 for Zenobia Discovered by Shepherds on the Bank of the River Araxes (1850; Paris, École Nationale Supérieur des Beaux-Arts) and spent four years in Italy. He painted Renaissance-type nudes, rather cloying religious subjects and portraits of photographic verisimilitude. This probably explains why Renoir, on being fitted with new glasses to correct his myopia, threw them on the floor, crying: 'Bon Dieu', je vois comme Bougueraeu!'"

French painter. Michel Bouillon was born into an artistic family in the north of France, at Ere near Tournai. He was received as a Freeman of his Guild there in 1638. His father seems to have been the Jean Bouillon who was the first teacher of Philippe de Champaigne."
646,"BOULANGER, Jean","(b. ca. 1606, Troyes, d. 1660, Modena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boulang/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in Italy. He was a pupil of Guido Reni. He became court painter in Modena where several of his works are conserved in the Galleria Estense. His most famous fresco is in the Palazzo Ducale (Castello Estense) in Modena where he participated in the decoration. In the 1650s he was active in Reggio Emilia and Rome.



"
647,"BOULANGER, Gustave","(b. 1824, Paris, d. 1888, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boulange/biograph.html,"
French painter. Born of creole parents, Boulanger became an orphan at 14. His uncle and guardian sent him to the studio of Pierre-Jules Jollivet and then in 1840 to Paul Delaroche, whose prosaic Realism and dry, careful technique influenced Boulanger's style of painting. A first visit to Algeria in 1845 gave him an interest in North African subjects, which was taken up later by his friend Jean-Léon Gérome. In 1849 he won the Prix de Rome with Ulysses Recognized by his Nurse (École Nationale Supérieur des Beaux-Arts, Paris), in which he combined academic figure drawing with Pompeian touches inspired by Ingres's Antiochus and Stratonice (1840; Musée Condé, Chantilly). Boulanger's knowledge of the ruins at Pompeii, which he visited while studying at the École de Rome, gave him ideas for many future pictures, including the Rehearsal in the House of the Tragic Poet (1855; St Petersburg, Hermitage), in which the influence of Stratonice is still obvious."
648,"BOULIAR, Marie Geneviève","(b. 1763, Paris, d. 1825, Bois-d'Arcy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouliar/biograph.html,"
French painter. She manifested an early vocation for art. She attended the workshops of Joseph-Benoit  Suvée, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Joseph Duplessis. Her production was intense during the revolutionary period, as evidenced by the catalogues of the Salons from 1791 to 1817. She received the Prix d'Encouragement at the 1795 Salon."
649,"BOULLE, André-Charles","(b. 1642, Paris, d. 1732, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boulle/biograph.html,"
André-Charles Boulle (also spelled Boule, or Buhl) was one of France's leading cabinet-makers, whose fashion of inlaying swept Europe and was heavily imitated during the 18th and 19th centuries. An architect as well, he also worked in bronze and mosaic and designed elaborate monograms.
 
Boulle followed in his father's footsteps and became a cabinet-maker. Before 1666 he was awarded the title of master cabinetmaker; in 1672 the king granted him the royal privilege of lodging in the Palais du Louvre. In the same year, he achieved the title of cabinet-maker and sculptor to Louis XIV, king of France. He was in charge of a workshop with many employees. His workshop produced furniture as well as works in gilt bronze such as chandeliers, wall lights, and mounts."
650,"BOULLÉE, Étienne-Louis","(b. 1728, Paris, d. 1799, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boullee/biograph.html,"
French visionary architect, theorist, and teacher. Boullée wanted originally to be a painter, but, following the wishes of his father, he turned to architecture. He studied with Jacques-François Blondel and Germain Boffrand and with Jean-Laurent Legeay and had opened his own studio by the age of 19. He designed several Parisian city mansions in the 1760s and '70s, notably the Hôtel de Brunoy (1774-79). Despite the innovative Neoclassicism of his executed works, Boullée achieved a truly lasting influence as a teacher and theorist. Through his atelier passed such masters as Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart, Jean-François-Thèrese Chalgrin, Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand (1760-1834), and Louis-Michel Thibault (1750-1815). In all, he taught for more than 50 years."
651,"BOULLOGNE, Bon","(b. 1649, Paris, d. 1717, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boullogn/bon/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was taught by his father, Louis Boullogne the Elder, together with his brother Louis Boullogne Younger, and his sisters Geneviève (1645-1708) and Madeleine (1646-1710). Louis the Elder took part in the decoration of the Louvre and Versailles. He was one of the fourteen founders of the Painting Academy and gave his children a solid traditional formation. "
652,"BOULLOGNE, Louis the Elder","(b. 1609, Paris, d. 1674, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boullogn/louis_e/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of painters, father of Bon Boullogne and Louis Boullogne the Younger. After taking his first lessons from a mediocre painter in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, he became a pupil of Blanchard and started to become known. He probably owed his early patronage to his father, who worked at the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Indeed, a crucifix that Louis painted for one of the rooms in the Hôtel de Ville pleased the municipal magistrates so much that they decided to grant him an allowance to enable him to continue his studies in Italy. Boullogne made the journey with the landscape painter Henri Mauperché (c. 1602-1686). In Rome he met Sébastien Bourdon, with whom he formed a close and lasting friendship."
653,"BOULLOGNE, Louis the Younger","(b. 1654, Paris, d. 1733, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boullogn/louis_y/biograph.html,"

French sculptor, painter and draughtsman. After working with his father, a cabinetmaker, in 1876 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse. In 1884 he was admitted as a pupil of Alexandre Falguière to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, but in rebellion against academic training left two years later. He then moved into a house (now the Musée Bourdelle) in the Impasse du Maine; Jules Dalou, for whom he had the greatest admiration, lived near by. From 1893 to 1905 he worked in the studio of Auguste Rodin, who had a marked influence on Bourdelle's art."
655,"BOURDICHON, Jean","(b. 1457, ?, d. 1521, Tours)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bourdich/biograph.html,"
French painter and illuminator. He worked in Tours towards the end of the 15th century and was an official painter to Louis XI, Charles VIII, Louis XII and Francis I. Despite the absence of Bourdichon's name from contemporary historical writings, he enjoyed the highest reputation in his own day. This is clear not only from the rank of those who commissioned work from him and from the sumptuous quality of his surviving works but also from the sheer quantity of works he produced, which implies that he had assistants to help him keep up with demand."
656,"BOURDIN, Michel","(b. ca. 1585, Orléans, d. 1645, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bourdin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He is best known as a sculptor of tombs and altar decorations although little of his work survives intact."
657,"BOURDON, Sébastien","(b. 1616, Montpellier, d. 1671, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bourdon/biograph.html,"French painter. In 1634-7 he worked in Rome, where he developed a talent for imitating the work of other painters - Claude, Dughet, van Laer - sometimes probably with intent to deceive. He continued in this vein when he returned to France and his oeuvre is still ill-defined.

"
658,"BOURLA, Pierre Bruno","(b. 1783, Paris, d. 1866, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bourla/biograph.html,"
Belgian architect. He was the city architect in Antwerp from 1819 to 1861, and a professor of architecture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. His most famous work is the Royal Theatre built between 1827 and 1834, known popularly after him as the Bourla theatre. He also designed new buildings for the Antwerp Academy, built the entrance gate to the city's botanical gardens, expanded the St. Elizabeth's hospital, restored the cathedral, and renovated the town hall.



"
659,"BOURSSE, Esaias","(b. 1631, Amsterdam, d. 1672, at sea)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boursse/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active mainly in his native Amsterdam. He joined the Dutch East India Company in 1661 and made two voyages to the Indies, on the second of which he died at sea. His few surviving paintings include some exquisite interior scenes that invite comparison with Vermeer because of their tranquil beauty and subtle colour harmonies.



"
660,"BOUT, Pieter","(b. 1658, Bruxelles, d. 1719, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bout/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, draughtsman and etcher. He enrolled at the Brussels guild of painters in 1671, his teacher is not known. From c. 1675 he spent several years in Paris, where he frequently collaborated with Adriaen Frans Boudewijns, a fellow countryman, as in the Village Fair (1686, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp), for which he painted the figures. He was then active in Brussels, where he married in 1695. He probably visited Italy.



"
661,"BOUTON, Charles-Marie","(b. 1781, Paris, d. 1853, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouton/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a student of Jacques Louis David, Jean-Victor Bertin and the first French panorama painter Pierre Prévost (1764-1823). He concentrated mostly on the perspective and the art of distributing light. In 1821-22, he developed the Diorama theatre with Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre (1787-1851), the inventor of the daguerreotype process of photography, and a professional scene painter for the theatre. Between 1822 and 1839 they were co-proprietors of the Diorama in Paris, an auditorium in which they displayed immense paintings of famous places and historical events. This scenographic entertainment included two enormous canvases, 14 by 22 metres in size, typically with one featuring a natural view and the other an architectural view, illuminated by moving, coloured lights. "
662,"BOUTS, Dieric the Elder","(b. ca. 1415, Haarlem, d. 1475, Leuven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouts/dirk_e/biograph.html,"Bouts came from the Northern Netherlands. He would seem to have been born in Haarlem, but no documentation has survived to prove this. What we do know for certain is that he worked in Louvain and that a certificate issued by that town on 12 July 1476 describes him as being of foreign origin: ""nativi ex patriam"". We do not know when he was born, only that it must have been some time between 1410 and 1420. Nor do we know who his masters were, though the influence of Rogier Van der Weyden is so clearly visible that it seems likely he may have worked in Rogier's studio in Brussels.

"
663,"BOUTS, Dieric the Younger","(b. ca. 1448, Leuven, d. 1491, Leuven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouts/dirk_y/biograph.html,"Netherlandish painter, elder son of Dieric Bouts the Elder (c. 1415-1475). He and his brother Aelbrecht (c. 1450/60-1549) continued their father's style. Particularly popular were small devotional images of the Mater Dolorosa and Christ Crowned with Thorns. Nothing is known for certain by Dieric the Younger, but a fine altarpiece known as the Pearl of Brabant (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) has been attributed to him, as well as to his father.

"
665,"BOUYS, André","(b. 1656, Hyères, d. 1740, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bouys/biograph.html,"
French painter. Although a native of Bar (Hyéres), from an early age André Bouys studied in Paris under François de Troy, a competent portrait painter and father of the more famous Jean-François de Troy. In Paris, he established his reputation as one of the foremost portraitists of his generation. "

French engraver, eldest of four children (with Françoise, Antoinette and Antoine) of Madeleine Stella (sister of Jacques Stella) who had married the Lyon goldsmith Étienne Bouzonnet. In c. 1654 all four moved to Paris to work for their uncle in his apartments in the Louvre and engrave his designs. On Jacques's death in 1657, Claudine, aged 21, took over the workshop, and was allowed to remain in the Louvre and continue her uncle's privilege."
667,"BOY, Willem","(b. ca. 1520, Mechelen, d. 1592, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boy/biograph.html,"
Willem Boy (or Guillaume Boyens), Flemish sculptor and architect, active in Sweden. He is first recorded at the court of Gustav I Vasa (reg 1523-1560) in 1557-58. Boy executed a gilded wood relief portrait of the King (Mariefred, Gripsholm Slott, Statens Porträttsamling), as well as his tomb (1562-83; Uppsala Cathedral). The latter, in red and white alabaster, is the earliest large-scale example of such a work in the Renaissance style in Sweden and is influenced by Dutch examples, with recumbent figures of the King and his two queens and an obelisk at each corner."
668,"BOYER, Michel","(b. 1668, Le Puy, d. 1724, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boyer/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied under his father Jean Boyer. In his early career, he enjoyed the patronage of Abbott Melchior de Polignac. He studied at Rome in 1689, where he followed the tradition of still-lifes of musical instruments presented on carpets, developed in a decorative Baroque style by the Bergamo painter Evaristo Baschenis. One still-life depicting a bass, music book and sword (Paris, Musée du Louvre, signed and dated 1693) attests his activity in this field."

670,"BOYS, Thomas Shotter","(b. 1803, London, d. 1874, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boys/biograph.html,"
English painter and printmaker. He was apprenticed on 4 February 1817 to George Cooke. His early training in engraving influenced his future career; his ability to draw a fine line, lay aquatint washes and hand-colour prints was an important factor in the creation of his particularly lucid style of watercolour landscapes and townscapes. At this time Cooke was engraving volumes of picturesque views by Turner and James Hakewell (1778-1843) as well as his own view of the Thames (1822); Boys went on to establish a reputation for his own lithographed volumes of picturesque tours.


"
671,"BOYVIN, René","(b. ca. 1525, Angers, d. ca. 1625, Angers)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boyvin/biograph.html,"
French engraver, etcher and designer. Vasari, in his Vita of Marcantonio Raimondi, mentions that 'after the death of Rosso [Fiorentino], we saw the arrival from France of all the engravings of his works'. He attributed this upsurge of engraved reproductions 'to the copperplate engraver René', that is René Boyvin. He came to Paris c. 1545 from Angers, where he was an associate of the mint. In Paris he may have been in contact with Antonio Fantuzzi, and he is known to have renewed a contract of service with the engraver Pierre Milan in 1549. In 1553 he completed two plates that Milan had failed to finish for the music publisher Guillaume Morlaye (c. 1510-after 1558); one of these was the Nymph of Fontainebleau. He later opened his own workshop, and it is known that Lorenzo Penni, the son of Luca, was working for him in October 1557."
672,"BOZE, Joseph","(b. 1745, Martigues, d. 1826, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/boze/biograph.html,"
French painter and inventor. He was the son of a sailor and studied painting at Marseille before settling in Arles. In 1778 he moved to Paris, where he studied with the pastellist Maurice Quentin de La Tour. He attempted some technical improvements in the fixing of pastel and established a reputation for himself as an engineer and mechanic, his system for bridling and instantaneously unbridling four-horse wagons receiving the approval of the Académie des Sciences when tested at Versailles."
673,"BRACCESCO, Carlo",(active 1478-1501 in Liguria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/braccesc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Carlo da Milano. He is first documented in 1478, when he executed the polyptych at Montegrazie, near Imperia; signed Carolus Mediolanensis, this large, three-tiered structure appears to be his only signed painting. An essentially Late Gothic, Lombard basis is agreed for this work, the complex sources of which also include Catalan and Venetian influences, the latter suggesting an affinity with such artists as Carlo Crivelli."
674,"BRACCI, Pietro","(b. 1700, Roma, d. 1773, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bracci/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor in Rome, a pupil of Camillo Rusconi. He attracted the attention of his contemporaries with his tomb of Benedict XIII in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, designed by Carlo Marchioni, and carried out in collaboration with Bartolomeo Pincellotti, who was responsible for the figure of Humility. This work opened the doors of fame and success to Bracci, who in 1742 became a member of the Accademia di San Luca. Two years later he executed the sculptural groups for the tomb of Maria Clementina Sobieski in St Peter's. He reused this composition in the tomb of Cardinal Leopoldo Calcagnini in Sant'Andrea della Fratte in 1746."

676,"BRAEU, Nicolaes",(active c. 1586-c. 1600 in Haarlem),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/braeu/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish printmaker. He was a pupil of Hendrick Goltzius or Jacob Matham. He is often confused with Gillis van Breen, a contemporary pupil of Hendrick Goltzius. However, recent research clarified that Nicolaes Braeu and Gillis van Breen were two distinct engravers.

Italian architect who introduced the High Renaissance style in architecture. His early works in Milan included the rectory of Sant'Ambrogio and the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In Rome, Bramante served as principal planner of Pope Julius II's comprehensive project for rebuilding the city. St. Peter's Basilica, of which he was the chief architect, was begun in 1506. Other major Roman works were the Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio (1502) and the Belvedere court in the Vatican (begun c. 1505)."
680,BRAMANTINO,"(b. ca. 1460, Milano, d. 1536, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bramanti/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo Suardi, called Bramantino, Milanese painter and architect, a follower of Bramante, from whom he takes his nickname. He was appointed court painter and architect to Duke Francesco II Sforza in 1525. His style as a painter is complex and eclectic, drawing on Piero della Francesca and Leonardo as well as Bramante.



"
681,"BRAMBILLA, Ambrogio",(active 1579–1599 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brambill/biograph.html,"
Italian printmaker and cartographer. Of Milanese origin, he is recorded first in Rome in 1579 as a member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, and he remained there at least until 1599, the date of his last work. In 1582 Brambilla produced a series of 135 small engravings of emperors from Julius Caesar to Rudolf II and in 1585 another series, of the popes to Sixtus V. His most successful works, however, were prints of scenographic reconstructions of antiquity such as the Sepulchre of Lucius Septimius (1582) and contemporary views of ancient and modern Rome, for example the Belvedere del Vaticano (1579) and the Fireworks Display at Castel Sant'Angelo (1579)."
682,"BRAMER, Leonaert","(b. 1596, Delft, d. 1674, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bramer/biograph.html,"
Dutch genre and history painter, active mainly in his native Delft. He travelled widely in Italy and France, 1614-28, and drew on a variety of influences for his most characteristic paintings - small nocturnal scenes with vivid effects of light. Works such as the Scene of Sorcery (Bordeaux) have earned him the reputation an interesting independent who cannot easily be pigeonholed. Bramer was also one of the few Dutch artists to paint frescoes in Holland, but none of his work in the medium survived. He evidently knew well the greatest of his Delft contemporaries, Vermeer, for he came to the latter's defence when his future mother-in-law was trying to prevent him from marrying her daughter. In fact, it is likely that Bramer, rather than Carel Fabritius, was Vermeer's teacher.



"
683,"BRAND, Christian Hilfgott","(b. 1694, Frankfurt/Oder, d. 1756, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brand/christia/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, part of a family of painters of German origin. He attended school in Hamburg but later lived in Regensburg, where his acquaintance with Christoph Ludwig Agricola led him to take up landscape painting. About 1720 he went to Vienna. From 1726 to 1728 Brand studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna, was elected as one of its first honorary members in 1751 and became an academic advisor in 1754. In 1738 Brand is mentioned as an imperial court painter, a position he held for the rest of his life."
684,"BRAND, Johann Christian","(b. 1722, Wien, d. 1795, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brand/johann/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, part of a family of painters. He was the son of Christian Hilfgott Brand, from whom he received his first instruction in landscape painting. In 1736 he became a pupil at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Vienna. In 1751-56 he was in the service of Nikolaus VIII, Graf Pálffy, on his estates in Hungary and at his residence in Bratislava. During this period he painted his earliest-known veduta, Landscape near Devin Castle, at the Confluence of the Morava and the Danube (National Gallery, Prague)."
685,"BRANDI, Giacinto","(b. 1621, Poli, d. 1691, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brandi/biograph.html,"
Italian Baroque painter. His early training was in Rome, in the workshop of the sculptor Alessandro Algardi, who encouraged his inclination towards disegno. He then worked under the Bolognese Giovanni Giacomo Sementi, an uninspired imitator of Guido Reni. Sementi died in 1636, and in 1638 Brandi visited Naples. In 1646-47 he was again in Rome, employed in the workshop of Giovanni Lanfranco, who had recently returned from Naples. This is confirmed by Brandi's Joseph's Dream (Rome, Galeria Corsini), which is based on one of Lanfranco's works. In 1647 Brandi joined the Accademia dei Virtuosi al Pantheon in Rome and from 1651 was present at the meetings of the Accademia di S Luca. He executed paintings, frescoes and stuccoes for the Chiesa di S. Carlo al Corso (1673-84), paintings for Chiesa di S. Andrea al Quirinale and for other churches in Rome.

"
687,"BRANT, Sebastian","(b. 1457, Strassburg, d. 1521, Strassburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brant/biograph.html,"
German humanist and satirist. He first attracted attention in humanistic circles by his Latin poetry, and edited many ecclesiastical and legal works; but he is now only known by his famous satire, Das Narrenschiff, published by Bergmann in 1494, the popularity and influence of which were not limited to Germany. Under the form of an allegory, a ship laden with fools and steered by fools goes to the fools paradise of Narragonia. Brant here lashes with unsparing vigour the weaknesses and vices of his time. Here he conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people. Although, like most of the German humanists, essentially conservative in his religious views, Brant's eyes were open to the abuses in the church, and the Narrenschiff was a most effective preparation for the Protestant Reformation.

Dutch painter of biblical and allegorical scenes, poet and architect. Salomon de Bray was born in Amsterdam in 1597 as the son of Simon de Bray and Marie Jansdr. His father was originally from Lier in the Southern Netherlands. Salomon must have moved to Haarlem before 1617, as he is referred to in that year as a 'friend' of a rhetoric association called De Wijngaardranken. That is the only year in which he is known to have been a member. His brother Simon, an attorney, was a member from 1616 to 1622 or possibly longer."
692,"BREA, Louis","(b. ca. 1450, Nice, d. ca. 1523, Nice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brea/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of Ligurian origin. Louis (Ludovico) Brea was among the first to set aside the traditional codes of Gothic art to bring the region of Liguria and the Comté de Nice into the Renaissance. He remains a reference in 15th and 16th century religious painting. His earliest known work is a Pietà, dated 1475 and on display at the Monastery of Cimiez in Nice, where another panel painting by Brea, a Crucifixion, completed in 1512, is also displayed."
693,"BRECK, John Leslie","(b. 1860, at South Pacific, d. 1899, Boston)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breck/biograph.html,"
American painter. He was one of the first Americans to settle in Giverny with Louis Ritter (1852-1896), Willard Leroy Metcalf (1858-1925) Blair Bruce (1859-1906), Henry Fitch Taylor (1853-1925), Theodore Robinson (1852-1896) and Thedore Wendel (1859-1932). He was invited by Dawson Dawson-Watson (1864-1939), the British born Impressionist painter to live in Giverny, the spring after the founding of the famous Impressionist colony there."
694,"BREDAEL, Jan Frans van","(b. 1686, Antwerpen, d. 1750, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bredael/jan/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of painters (often known as Breda), son of Alexander van Bredael (1633-1720), also a painter."
695,"BREDAEL, Joseph van","(b. 1688, Antwerpen, d. 1739, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bredael/joseph/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a long line of painters, a younger cousin of Jan Frans van Bredael. He was a landscape artist specialised in refined copies and variants of Jan Brueghel the Elder's compositions."
696,"BREEN, Gillis van","(b. ca. 1560, Haarlem, d. ca. 1622, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breen/biograph.html,"
Gillis (also Egidius, Jelis) van Breen, Netherlandish printmaker. He was a pupil of Hendrick Goltzius and effectively imitated and adopted his engraving style. Van Breen is often confused with another contemporary Goltzius pupil, Nicolaes Braeu. However, recent research clarified that Nicolaes Braeu and Gillis van Breen were two distinct engravers.



"
697,"BREEN, Adam van","(b. ca. 1585, Amsterdam, d. ca. 1642, Norway)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breen_a/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and printmaker. He worked in The Hague between 1611 and 1618. He married in 1611 and in 1612 he was registered with the guild in this town."
698,"BREENBERGH, Bartholomeus","(b. 1598/1600, Deventer, d. 1657, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breenber/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, with Poelenburgh the leading pioneer of the taste for Italianate landscapes in the Netherlands. Breenbergh spent most of the 1620s in Italy and thereafter worked in Amsterdam. His style as a painter is very similar to Poelenburgh's, his biblical and mythological characters set in well-balanced views of the Roman Campagna, often complete with classical ruins. His drawings are much fresher and bolder, and have often passed under the name of Claude, as is the case with two examples in Christ Church, Oxford. Late in his career Breenbergh turned to figure painting.



"
699,"BREGHTEL, Hans Conraedt","(b. ca. 1608, Nürnberg, d. 1675, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breghtel/biograph.html,"
German goldsmith, active in The Netherlands. He was one of the leading goldsmiths working in The Hague in the mid 17th century. One of his masterpieces is a clock, inspired by classical architecture, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors and architects. They were active in the 15th and the early 16th century. One of the most important and extensive family dynasties in Italian Renaissance sculpture, the Bregni came from the village of Righeggia, near Osteno on Lake Lugano. Active primarily in northern Italy (Lombardy, Emilia, and the Veneto), a few Bregni also worked in central Italy. Several Bregno artists are documented, although the precise familial relationship between most of them is still unclear. The most important artists in the family were Antonio Bregno, Andrea Bregno, Giovanni Battista Bregno and Lorenzo Bregno."
701,"BREGNO, Antonio",(active 1425-1457 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bregno/antonio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors and architects. They were active in the 15th and the early 16th century.

702,"BREGNO, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1467–77, d. after 1518)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bregno/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors and architects. They were active in the 15th and the early 16th century.

703,"BREGNO, Lorenzo","(b. ca. 1480, Verona, d. 1525, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bregno/lorenzo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, part of family of sculptors and architects, younger brother of Giovanni Battista Bregno."
704,"BREITNER, George Hendrik","(b. 1857, Rotterdam, d. 1923, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breitner/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and photographer. He trained as a painter and draughtsman at the academy in The Hague from 1875 to 1877. Although the Dutch painter Charles Rochussen taught the students history and landscape painting, Breitner's interests did not lie in this area. In 1880 he worked for a year in the studio of Willem Maris after his academy training. Maris belonged to the Hague school of painters, who worked in the plein-air tradition of the French Barbizon school. Breitner painted outdoor life with them, although it was not the picturesqueness of the landscape or the Dutch skies that appealed to him."
705,"BREKELENKAM, Quiringh van","(b. ca. 1622, Zwammerdam, d. ca. 1669, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brekelen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He probably trained in Leiden, possibly under Gerrit Dou. In 1648, with several other painters, he founded the Guild of St Luke in Leiden. He married for the first time in 1648 and again in 1656, a year after his first wife's death. In 1649 his sister Aeltge married the painter Johannes Oudenrogge (1622-53), and the couple soon moved to Haarlem while the Brekelenkam family remained in Leiden. About 1656 Brekelenkam apparently acquired a licence to sell beer and brandy, perhaps because his income as a painter was insufficient to support his large family (six children from his first marriage and three from his second). He continued to be active as an artist and paid his guild dues fairly regularly. The last dues were paid in 1667, and his last dated painting, the Portrait of a Man Aged 33, is from 1669.



"
706,"BRENDEL, Johann Gottlob David",(1753-1803),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brendel/biograph.html,"
German architect. He is known as the builder of some ""fancy"" buildings such as the Hermitage (erected in 1796 by Friedrich Wilhelm II near the Cecilienhof in the Neues Garten on the ""Am Quapphorn"" land projecting in the Jungfernsee in Potsdam) and the castle folly on Pfaueninsel in Berlin (1794-97).



"
707,"BRENNA, Vincenzo","(b. 1745, Firenze, d. 1820, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brenna/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and painter, active in Poland and Russia. Brenna was born to an artistic family and studied in Rome to be a painter (where he was a contemporary of Giacomo Quarenghi). He was designing interiors in Poland for Count Stanislaw Kostka Potocki when he met the future Russian Emperor Paul and his wife Maria Fyodorovna, and was invited to join Charles Cameron's team decorating the interiors of the Grand Palace at Pavlovsk."
708,"BRESCIANINO, Andrea del","(b. ca. 1485, Brescia, d. ca. 1545, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brescian/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (originally Andrea Piccinelli). The Brescianino brothers Andrea and Raffaello (active 1506-1545) were born in Siena and collaborated on various altarpieces there. Their work cannot be clearly separated. They painted mythological figures as well as altarpieces and small devotional works. Their father was a dancing-master at Siena, the family name derives from the birthplace of the father."
709,"BRESOLIN, Domenico","(b. ca. 1815, Padova, d. ca. 1899, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bresolin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and photographer. His father, also named Domenico, was a bricklayer. Domenico the son worked as a decorator and in 1841 enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice. Here he studied with the architect Francesco Wucovich Lazzari (1791-1856), the painters Francesco Bagnara (1784-1866) and Tranquillo Orsi (1771-1845), the sculptor Luigi Zandomeneghi. Around 1845 he studied in Florence with the Hungarian landscape painter Károly Markó the Elder. During the same period he worked in Rome, where he showed his paintings in various exhibitions. Subsequently he continued working in Milan and in Venice as a landscape painter."
710,"BRETEZ, Louis","(d. 1738, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bretez/biograph.html,"
French architect and cartographer. He is known for the map of Paris which he prepared in 1734-38 for Michel-Étienne Turgot, provost of the merchants of Paris. Bretez was member of the Academy of Saint-Luc, rival of the Royal Academy of painting and sculpture.



"
711,"BRETON, Jules","(b. 1827, Courrières, d. 1906, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breton/biograph.html,"
French painter and writer. After the death of his mother he was brought up in the village of Courrières by his father, grandmother and uncle. The last instilled in him respect for tradition and a commitment to the philosophical ideas of the 18th century. Breton's father, as supervisor of the lands of the Duc de Duras, encouraged him to develop a deep knowledge of and affection for his native region and its heritage, which remained central to his art."
712,"BREU, Jörg the Elder","(b. 1475/76, Augsburg, d. 1537, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breu/elder/biograph.html,"
German painter and designer of woodcuts whose subjects included portraits, altarpieces and battle scenes. He was one of the leading painters of his time in Augsburg, but his most important works there - a series of frescoes in the town hall - are no longer extant. He was patronized by the emperor Maximilian and by Duke William IV of Bavaria, for whom he painted The Battle of Zama (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) in the same series as Altdorfer's celebrated Battle of Issus."
713,"BREU, Jörg the Younger","(b. ca. 1510, Augsburg, d. 1547, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/breu/younger/biograph.html,"
German painter, miniaturist, and draftsman, son of Jörg Breu the Elder. One of the leading figures of Augsburg Renaissance art, Jörg Breu the Elder was also one of the most versatile and productive designers of woodcuts of his day, especially in the field of book illustration. Books like Thucydides' Peloponnesian War (1533) and Barlatius's Scanderbeg (1533), which were illustrated by both Breu and his son Jörg, bear witness to the increasing role Breu the Younger began to play in the workshop of the aged master. A pupil and assistant of his father, the son, who later adopted the workshop sign, accomplished the stylistic shift towards a classicising idiom that can already be observed in the late woodcuts of the elder Breu. "
714,"BRIATI, Giuseppe","(b. 1686, Murano, d. 1772, Murano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/briati/biograph.html,"
Italian glassmaker, active in Murano. Born from a family of glassmakers he apparently had the chance to work in a Bohemian glass factory, where he learned the secrets of working the crystal, that at the time was taking over Venetian glass leadership on the European market. Briati contributed significantly to improve the fortunes of the Venetian glass, which after having experienced a period of success, was heavily decayed. His furnace became famous for the production of Bohemian inspired glass with a twist of eccentricity, that through colours and decorations gave them the look of triumph of polychrome flowers."
715,"BRIDELL, Frederick Lee","(b. 1830, Southampton, d. 1863, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bridell/biograph.html,"
English painter. His early works were portraits, but in 1848 the picture-dealer Edwin Holder gave him a five-year contract to copy Old Masters. He specialized in landscape and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851 (A Bit in Berkshire)."
716,"BRIDGEMAN, Charles","(b. 1690, d. 1738, Kensington)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bridgema/biograph.html,"
English landscape architect. He had an enormous influence on the design of the informal English garden, introducing features that preceded the looser plans of Lancelot Brown (1716-1783) and William Kent. He is credited with the introduction of the French ha-ha to England in 1719 at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and later used it in the simple form commonly found during the 18th century. He also used the French pattes d'oie (literally 'goose-foot', but meaning avenues crossing each other) that drew attention towards various eye-catchers."
717,"BRIL, Matthijs the Younger","(b. 1550, Antwerpen, d. 1583, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bril/matthijs/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman of landscapes, brother of the more famous Paul Bril. He moved to Rome at a young age. He spent most of his active career in Rome where his drawings of ancient Roman sites played an important role in the development of topographical landscape art. He was also a painter of capricci (architectural fantasies), with typical rustic hills with a few ruins. He is documented as the painter of several frescoes in the Vatican."
718,"BRIL, Paul","(b. 1554, Antwerpen, d. 1626, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bril/paul/biograph.html,"
Flemish landscape painter, active mainly in Rome, where he settled in about 1575. Bril painted frescos, but his fame rests on his small easel paintings. He lived long enough to assimilate some of the qualities of Elsheimer's and Annibale Carracci's landscapes and his work bridges the gap between the fantastic 16th century Flemish Mannerist style and the more plausible, idealized Italian landscapes of the 17th century. He also made views of Rome for the tourist trade, and marine pictures. His conception of both of these subjects had considerable influence upon Agostino Tassi, the teacher of Claude Lorrain, and upon Claude himself. Paul's brother, Matthew or Matthijs, also worked in Rome, and their work is hard to differentiate.



"
719,"BRINCKMANN, Philipp Hieronymus","(b. 1709, Speyer, d. 1760, Mannheim)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brinckma/biograph.html,"
German painter, draughtsman and etcher. Trained by Johann Georg Dathan (1703-c. 1748) in Speyer, he was a court painter in Mannheim from 1733 until his death, from 1755 gallery director and from 1757 a privy councilor. Of the religious works that, as a court painter, he was obliged to produce, the only ones that survive are frescoes (spandrel paintings) depicting the Four Quarters of the World (after 1748; Mannheim, former Jesuit church of SS Ignaz und Franz Xavier) and ceiling paintings in Electress Elizabeth Augusta's library in Schloss Mannheim."
720,"BRIOSCO, Benedetto","(b. ca. 1460, Milano, d. ca. 1514, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/briosco/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. The first notice of his activity dates from 1477, when he and his brother-in-law Francesco Cazzaniga (active 1470-1488) were employed as sculptors on the monument to Giovanni Borromeo and Vitaliano Borromeo (Isola Bella, Palazzo Borromeo, chapel), which was executed for San Francesco Grande, Milan. By 1482 he had begun employment for the Fabbrica del Duomo (Cathedral Works) of Milan Cathedral. During 1483-84 it is likely that he assisted Francesco and Tommaso Cazzaniga in the execution of the tomb of Cristoforo and Giacomo Antonio della Torre (Milan, Santa Maria delle Grazie). In 1484 he and the Cazzaniga brothers began work on the tomb of Pietro Francesco Visconti di Saliceto destined for the Milanese church of Santa Maria del Carmine (destroyed). This project was completed by Briosco and Tommaso Cazzaniga following Francesco Cazzaniga's death at the beginning of 1486. In the same year Benedetto and Tommaso were commissioned to finish the tomb of Giovanni Francesco Brivio (Milan, Sant'Eustorgio), designed and begun by Francesco. Briosco's hand is virtually impossible to distinguish in these collaborative works."
721,"BRITTO, Giovanni",(active 1530-1550 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/britto/biograph.html,"
Woodcutter of German origin (originally Johannes Breit), active in Italy. His first work in Venice was the illustration of Petrarca spirituale by Girolamo Malipiero, published by Francesco Marcolini in 1536. In 1543 the inscription In Vinegia per Giovanni Britto Intagliatore... appears in the colophon of La congiuratione de Gheldresi contro la citta Danversa by Joannes Servilius (Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale), an unillustrated book printed by Marcolini, but there is no documentary evidence that Britto designed the fount, and his relationship with Marcolini is unclear."
722,"BRIZIO, Francesco","(b. ca. 1574, Bologna, d. 1623, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brizio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver of the Bolognese School, active in the early-Baroque. He was also known as Nosadella and was born in Bologna."
723,"BROC, Jean","(b. 1771, Montignac, d. 1850, Poland)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/broc/biograph.html,"
French painter and designer. He came from a family of shopkeepers and tailors and he served in the Republican army during the wars of the Vendée. By 1798 he was a student of Jacques-Louis David, who provided a small apartment in the Louvre where Broc often lived. With a group of David's students and some writers, Broc formed a dissenting sect called Les Primitifs, Barbus (bearded ones), Méditateurs or Penseurs. Broc was typical of the Primitifs in finding inspiration in Greek vase painting and Italian 15th-century art.



"
724,"BROCKY, Károly","(b. 1807, Temesvár, d. 1855, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brocky/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter, active in England. After his studies at the Art Academy in Vienna, he went to Italy in 1835, and to Paris in 1837, where he improved his art mostly by copying old pictures of the Louvre. He settled down in London in 1838, and he soon received orders from the Court. Besides portraits of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, etc. he painted mythological pictures under the influence of Italian masters of the Renaissaince. His nudes and portraits of women full of life make his art attractive. The eclectic altarpiece, Christ and the Woman from Samaria, strongly reflecting the influence of Renaissance masters of Rome, was presented to the Lutheran church of Eperjes, but it burnt down in 1913. His works: Poverty, Woman in Yellow Clothes, Sleeping Bacchante, Woman in Black Clothes, Amor and Psyche, and Resting Psyche (Hungarian National Gallery)



"
725,"BRODSZKY, Sándor","(b. 1819, Tóalmás, d. 1901, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brodszky/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He studied medicine in Pest, before moving on in 1841 to the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna, where he studied painting under Josef Mössmer (1780-1845) and Franz Steinfeld (1787-1868). In 1845 he went to Munich, where he spent ten years, during which time he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste under Albert Zimmermann (1808-88) and Friedrich Voltz (1817-86). His ideal landscape painter, however, was Carl Rottmann. In 1847 he exhibited his painting Solitary Mill (private collection) at the Kunstverein in Munich. He subsequently became a well-known landscape painter."
726,"BROECK, Elias van den","(b. ca. 1650, Antwerpen, d. 1708, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/broeck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was born in Antwerp, but at an early age moved with his parents to Amsterdam, where he was apprenticed to a goldsmith in 1665. In the same year he became a pupil of the still-life painter, Cornelis Kick, with whom he remained until 1669. Subsequently he trained under Jan Davidsz. De Heem at Utrecht and apparently followed him when he returned to Antwerp in 1672."
727,"BROECK, Crispin van den","(b. 1523, Mechelen, d. 1591, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/broeck_c/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draftsman. He came from a family of artists, was probably trained by his father, and was the brother of the sculptor Willem van den Broeck (1530-1580) and the painter Hendrick van den Broeck (c. 1530-c. 1597). He worked as a painter, draftsman and engraver."
728,"BROEDERLAM, Melchior",(active 1381-1409),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/broederl/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, court painter to Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, from 1387. Documents show that he was a busy and versatile artist, but his only surviving works are two wings from an altarpiece representing The Annunciation and Visitation and The Presentation and Flight into Egypt (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon, 1394-9). They are among the first and finest examples of International Gothic, combining lavish decorative display with realistic touches that look forward to the later development of the Netherlandish School. The figure of St Joseph in The Flight into Egypt, for example, is represented as an authentic peasant.



"
729,"BROMPTON, Richard","(b. ca. 1734, ?, d. 1783, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brompton/biograph.html,"
English portrait painter. He studied under Benjamin Wilson and afterwards under Raphael Mengs at Rome where he became acquainted with the Earl of Northampton, whom he accompanied to Venice. During his stay in Venice he painted the portraits of the Duke of York and other English gentlemen, in a conversation piece (Royal Collection, London), which was exhibited at Spring Gardens in 1763. In 1765 Brompton settled in London and established a good practice with small-scale works in the manner of Johann Zoffany. He was an exhibitor at the Society of Arts and Royal Academy between the years 1767 and 1780."
730,"BRONCHORST, Jan Gerritsz van","(b. 1603, Utrecht, d. 1661, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bronchor/jan/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and enfgraver, the son of a gardener. At the age of eleven he was apprenticed to a glass engraver. In 1620, he went to France, where he spent eighteen months working for a glass engraver in Arras. He subsequently moved to Paris, remaining there until 1622, when he returned to Utrecht and became a burgher of the city. In 1626, Van Bronchorst married Catalijntje van Noort, and rented a house in the Minderbroederstraat. He was employed as a glass engraver but frequented the studio of the painter Gerard van Honthorst, which was known as the Academia. Van Bronchorst's son Johannes was baptised in 1627, and his son Gerrit around 1636. Both were to become painters, like their father."
731,"BRONCHORST, Johannes van","(b. 1627, Utrecht, d. 1656, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bronchor/johannes/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, son of Jan (Gerritsz.) van Bronchorst. Johannes and his younger brother Gerrit (Jansz.) van Bronchorst (c. 1636-1673), who later worked in the style of Cornelis van Poelenburgh, travelled together to Rome, where Johannes is documented between 1648 and 1650. There he developed a cool, academic style, which he combined with Caravaggesque light effects. Closest to the work of Caravaggio is his St Bartholomew (1652; Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna). The influence of his father is perhaps most obvious in Bathsheba with David's Letter (Palazzo Barberini, Rome). Its composition of figures seen from below was inspired by Jan Gerritsz.'s balcony scenes, but the darker colouring, the elegantly elongated proportions and the contemplative air of his figures distinguish the work from that of his father, as does the different style of his signature. In Rome and later in Amsterdam, he was regarded as the creator of particularly refined portraits, in which the sitters are so stylized as to be lifeless.



"
732,"BRONDGEEST, Albertus","(b. 1786, Amsterdam, d. 1849, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brondgee/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. He was a pupil of Pieter Gerardus van Os, and studied 17th-century Dutch drawings in the Amsterdam collections of his time. In 1807 he became an international art broker and in that capacity he represented important Dutch collectors at auctions and handled the sale of their collections.



"
733,"BRONGNIART, Alexandre-Théodore","(b. 1739, Paris, d. 1813, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brongnia/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was educated at the Collège de Beauvais and at the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he studied (c. 1760) under Jacques-François Blondel and Étienne-Louis Boullée. He never won the Prix de Rome, however, nor did he study in Italy, but in the 1770s he became one of the most fashionable architects of town houses (hôtels particuliers) in Paris, particularly in the northern part of the Chaussée d'Antin quarter and south of Les Invalides, which he helped develop as smart residential areas. His success was largely the result of the patronage of Louis-Philippe I, 4th Duc d'Orléans (1725-1785), and Louis-Philippe's rival, the Prince de Condé; this patronage began after the Marquise de Montesson, mistress to the Duc d'Orléans (after 1773 his wife), inherited the Marquis's fortune in 1769 and commissioned Brongniart to build her a house (destroyed; drawing, Paris, Carnavalet). The result was a relatively modest hôtel just east of the Rue de la Chaussée d'Antin, recalling the early work of Boullée."
734,"BRONZINO, Agnolo","(b. 1503, Firenze, d. 1572, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bronzino/biograph.html,"
Florentine Mannerist painter (originally Agnolo di Cosimo), the pupil and adopted son of Pontormo, who introduced his portrait as a child into his painting Joseph in Egypt (National Gallery, London).

"
735,"BROOKING, Charles","(b. ca. 1723, London, d. 1759, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brooking/biograph.html,"
English painter. His father was possibly the Charles Brooking who was employed as a painter and decorator at Greenwich Hospital, London, between 1729 and 1736. From the period before 1750 there are two small marine paintings inscribed 'C. Brooking aged 17 years' (private collection), and it is recorded that he worked for a picture dealer in Leicester Square, London. In 1752 he worked as a botanical draughtsman for John Ellis (?1710-76), providing the illustrations for the latter's Natural History of the Corallines (London, 1755), in which he was referred to in the introduction as 'a celebrated painter of sea-pieces'."
736,"BROSAMER, Hans","(b. ca. 1500, Fulda, d. 1554, Erfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brosamer/biograph.html,"
German painter and printmaker. One of the German printmakers of the 1500s known as the ""Little Masters"" because of their finely executed, small-scale prints, Hans Brosamer was instrumental in raising the standard of German Protestant book illustration. He worked in Fulda from about 1520 to 1545, painting portraits of distinguished local citizens and designing engravings and woodcuts. Brownish flesh tones, green backgrounds, and an interest in fine materials characterized his portraits. "
737,"BROSSE, Salomon de","(b. 1571, Verneuil-en-Halatte, d. 1626, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brosse/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the most influential French architect of the early 17th century, whose works facilitated the development of the classical châteaus designed by the generation that followed him.
 
He was born into a family of Protestant architects, trained under his father and then quickly achieved success on his own. As architect to the queen regent, Marie de Médicis, from 1608, he prepared designs for the Palais du Luxembourg (built c. 1614-30), which featured a rusticated façade influenced by those of Italian Renaissance palazzi. This work and three châteaus - Coulommiers (1613), Montceaux (completed 1615), and especially Blérancourt (completed prior to 1619) - strongly influenced later architects, particularly François Mansart, who worked under de Brosse at Coulommiers."

"
740,"BROWN, Ford Madox","(b. 1821, Calais, d. 1893, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brown/biograph.html,"
English painter, born in Calais, and studied in Belgium, Paris (1840-44) and Rome (1845-46). In Rome he met Overbeck and other Nazarene artists, and was strongly influenced by their use of clear colour and medieval subject matter, which reinforced the teaching he had received in Belgium. He went to England in 1846, and his Wycliffe (Bradford, with preparatory sketch) of 1847-48 so impressed Rossetti that he asked to become his pupil. This brought Brown into the orbit of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Although he never became a member of the Brotherhood he had much in common with them, notably painting out of doors and developing an interest in contemporary genre subjects, such as his evocative The Last of England (1852-55, Birmingham), inspired by the emigration to the Colonies in the mid-19th century."
741,"BROWN, Lancelot (Capability)","(b. 1716, Kirkharle, d. 1783, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brown_ca/biograph.html,"
English landscape architect. Beginning work as a gardener's boy in Northumberland, in 1742 Brown obtained a post at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, one of the most talked of gardens of the day. His duties included showing the grounds to visitors, thus giving him a chance to make himself known to the nobility who were to be his clients. For some years he worked at Stowe under the broad direction of the landscape architect William Kent. After Kent's death, he set up as a garden designer and by 1753 was the leading ""improver of grounds"" in England."
742,"BROWN, Mather","(b. 1761, Boston, d. 1831, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/brown_ma/biograph.html,"
American painter, active in England. He was descended from four generations of New England religious leaders; John Singleton Copley painted portraits of his mother (Yale University, Art Gallery, New Haven) and his maternal grandfather (American Antiquarian Society. Worcester), John Trumbull was his friend and Gilbert Stuart 'learnt me to draw' at age 12. At 16 Brown walked 640 km to Peekskill, NY, and back, selling wine and painting miniature portraits; from these pursuits he earned enough to pay for three years of study in Europe."
743,"BRUAND, Jacques","(b. 1624, Paris, d. 1664, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bruand/jacques/biograph.html,"
French architect, part of a family of architects, brother of Libéral Bruand. In 1644 Jacques Bruand (Bruant) was made architect to Gaston, Duc d'Orléans (1608-60), and was appointed architecte du Roi two years later. In 1646-47 Bruand worked in Paris as master-builder to Antoine Le Pautre on the Hôtel de Fontenay-Mareuil in the Rue Coq Héron. In partnership with his brother Libéral Bruand, he extended the Hôtel Catelan (1659-61), 18 Rue Vivienne. Further works in Paris in the 1650s include the façade of the Bureau des Marchands-Drapiers (now in the Musée Carnavalet) at 11 Rue des Déchargeurs, which was designed as the background to an ornamental sculpture, and the Château du Fayel (1653-60) for the Maréchal de la Mothe Houdancourt. This château is in a 'brick-and-stone' style unfashionable in the mid-17th century, but it has several innovative features: Italianate ceilings, peristyles at the entrance and no moat. Bruand's designs for the Hôtel Jabach (c. 1650) somewhat prefigure the high classical style of French Baroque architecture. Towards the end of his career he appears to have supervised work on the Hôtel de Guéménée.

Canadian painter, Canada's first impressionist painter who established his artistic reputation in Europe. Bruce studied law at the Hamilton Collegiate Institute before working for three years in a handwriting academy run by his father, a gifted calligrapher and amateur water-colourist. Both parents encouraged his artistic talents. He took painting lessons from his father, from John Herbert Caddy, and from Henry Martin, and briefly attended the Hamilton Art School in 1877. After three years of study in an architect's office he settled on a career: to become an artist."

747,"BRUEGHEL, Ambrosius","(b. 1617, Antwerpen, d. 1675, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bruegel/ambrosiu/biograph.html,"
Ambrosius Brueghel was a Flemish painter, the younger son Jan Brueghel the Elder. He continued his father's style together with his brother Jan Brueghel the Younger (1601-78). Their sons carried on the tradition into the 18th century. Pieter Bruegel (1520-69), usually known as Pieter Bruegel the Elder to distinguish him from his elder son, was the first in a family of Flemish painters. He spelled his name Brueghel until 1559, and his sons retained the ""h"" in the spelling of their names.



"
748,"BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder","(b. c.1568, Bruxelles, d. 1625, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bruegel/jan_e/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, second son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. (The father spelled his name Brueghel until 1559, and his sons retained the ""h"" in the spelling of their names.) Early in his career he visited Cologne and Italy, before settling in Antwerp in 1597. He enjoyed a highly successful and honourable career there, becoming Dean of the Guild, working for the Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella, and making frequent visits to Brussels court. His specialities were still-lifes, especially flower paintings, and landscapes, but he worked in entirely different spirit from his father, depicting brilliantly coloured, lush woodland scenes, often with mythological figures, in the manner of Coninxloo and Bril. His exquisite flower paintings were rated the finest of the day, and his virtuoso skill at depicting delicate textures earned him the nickname 'Velvet Brueghel'.

Often he collaborated with other artists (notably his close friend Rubens), painting backgrounds, animals, or flowers for them. He had considerable influence, notably on his pupil Daniel Seghers, his sons Jan II and Ambrosius,, and his grandson Jan van Kessel. Further descendants and imitators carried his style into the 18th century.

Painter, son of Jan Brueghel the Elder. He probably trained in the studio of his father and then went to Milan to meet his father's patron, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. In the spring of 1624 Jan the Younger travelled to Palermo, Sicily, with his childhood friend Anthony van Dyck. After the sudden death of his father in a cholera epidemic in Antwerp, Jan returned to the Netherlands, and by early August 1625 he was back in Antwerp, where he took over his father's studio. He sold the pictures left by his father and successfully completed half-finished works. In 1625 Jan the Younger joined the Antwerp Guild of St Luke, and in 1626 he married Anna Maria, the daughter of Abraham Janssens; they had eleven children."
750,"BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder","(b. ca. 1525, Brogel, d. 1569, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bruegel/pieter_e/biograph.html,"Pieter Bruegel the Elder (byname Peasant Bruegel, also spelled Brueghel or Breughel), the greatest Flemish painter of the 16th century, whose landscapes and vigorous, often witty scenes of peasant life are particularly renowned. He spelled his name Brueghel until 1559, and his sons retained the ""h"" in the spelling of their names. Since Bruegel signed and dated many of his works, his artistic evolution can be traced from the early landscapes, in which he shows affinity with the Flemish 16th-century landscape tradition, to his last works, which are Italianate. He exerted a strong influence on painting in the Low Countries, and through his sons Jan and Pieter he became the ancestor of a dynasty of painters that survived into the 18th century.

(The father spelled his name Brueghel until 1559, and his sons retained the ""h"" in the spelling of their names.) Known as ""Hell Brueghel"" because of his fascination with hobgoblins, fires, and grotesque figures, he made his career in Antwerp, where he became a master in the  guild in 1585. He is best known as a copyist of his father's paintings, as they were both popular  and scarce. In his own canvases, such as Village Fair and The Crucifixion, he shows a firm  grasp of space and movement. His son, Pieter Brueghel III, was also known primarily as a copyist.

Barthel (Bartholomäus) Bruyn the Elder was a German painter in Cologne, chiefly of portraits. His religious works are much influenced Netherlandish painters of the late 15th century, and his portraits, which are grimly realistic representations of unaristocratic sitters, are very close to those of Joos van Cleve. In 1515-16 he is documented as a painter of altarpieces, and the Xanten Altar was commissioned in 1529. His career, 1515-55 invites parallels with Holbein and Lucas van Leyden, although a beautiful Nativity of 1516 (Frankfurt) is closer to Geertgen.

Italian painter (originally Buonamico di Cristofani), a tantalizingly enigmatic figure. Various early sources attest to his celebrity as an artist - evidently one of the leading painters of the post-Giotto generation -  and a burlesque character. Their cumulative testimony is impressive, but as no works can be securely attributed to him, many critics have regarded him as a legendary rather than a historical figure. Recently, however, there have been attempts to give Buffalmacco a stature commensurate with his literary reputation by attributing to him the famous frescoes of The Triumph of Death in the Campo Santo, Pisa, which until the essay by Luciano Bellosi in 1974 was considered the work of Francesco Traini."

Italian painter. Many of his paintings were attributed by Berenson to an anonymous master he called Ugolino-Lorenzetti, because of the artist's obvious indebtedness to the work of Ugolino di Nerio and Pietro Lorenzetti. A group of paintings that partially overlapped with these was attributed by Dewald to an artist he called the Ovile Master, after a painting formerly in S Pietro a Ovile, Siena. In 1931 Meiss recognized that these works formed the oeuvre of a single artist, and in 1936 he identified this figure as Bartolommeo Bulgarini. Subsequent discoveries have confirmed Meiss's hypothesis and established a dated work around which the rest of Bulgarini's paintings can be studied."

He made measured drawings of ancient monuments while in Rome (c. 1540-45). From c. 1550 to 1567 Bullant was in the service of the Constable Anne, Duc de Montmorency and resided at Montmorency's château of Écouen (Val-d'Oise) from 1556 to 1578, where he produced his major works. He began with the exterior façade of the north wing, basing the composition directly on Roman models as well as on Vitruvian doctrine. His monumental entry pavilion on the east wing, with its triumphal arch motif composed of superimposed orders (1555-60; destroyed 1787, but known through an engraving by Jacques Androuet I Du Cerceau), recalls Philibert Delorme's portico at Anet (Eure-et-Loire). Bullant used the Giant order for the first time in France in the entry portal to the south wing of the court (c. 1560); although modelled on that of the Corinthian portico of the Pantheon in Rome, its context here was not strictly classical. Michelangelo's two white marble slaves, once destined for the tomb of Julius II, adorned the niches."

He was appointed as a draughtsman to the Académie in 1673, with a full fellowship in 1685. In 1672 Bullet completed the triumphal arch of the Porte Saint-Denis, designed by François Blondel, on the new, tree-lined boulevard with which Louis XIV replaced the former rampart, and two years later he built the Porte Saint-Martin to his own design."

American painter. Bunker was born in Brooklyn, New York, but became closely associated with Boston. After studying first with William Merritt Chase and then with Jean-Léon Gérôme in Paris, Bunker accepted a teaching position at Boston's Cowles School of Art in 1885. Though he lived for only an additional five years, he is credited with introducing Bostonians to European artistic ideas and developments, and is considered one of the founding members of the Boston School of painters. "
783,"BUONCONSIGLIO, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1465, Vicenza, d. ca. 1535, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buoncons/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also called Il Marescalco. Probably apprenticed in Vicenza to Bartolommeo Montagna by 1484, he was influenced by many painters during his formative years. He is documented as having settled in Venice on 22 January 1495, where he may have revived a friendship with Cima da Conegliano, whom he may have known in Vicenza. The few works predating 1497 that have been identified as Buonconsiglio's are dominated by Lombard influences, the spatial and monumental qualities of Antonello da Messina and Mantegna being particularly evident, as well as the influence of Bramante. Among these early works are the signed Pietà (c. 1495; Vicenza, Museo Civico) and a related drawing depicting Christ at the Column (Paris, Louvre)."
784,"BUONSIGNORI, Stefano","(active in Florence, d. 1589)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buonsign/biograph.html,"
Italian cartographer and Olivetan friar, active in Florence in the second half of the 16th century. In 1576, he was called upon by Grand Duke Francesco I to fill the post of Grand Ducal Cosmographer, which had remained vacant since the departure of Egnatio Danti from Florence. Francesco I charged him with completing the Map Room of the Palazzo Vecchio, according to the project conceived by Danti with Cosimo I, which planned the realisation of 52 geographical maps of the whole world painted on the compartments of the cupboards. In 1584 Buonsignori published a semiperspectival map of Florence, and drew the two chorographies of the Dominio fiorentino and the Dominio senese which he later ordered to be painted as frescoes on the Sala delle Matematiche of the Uffizi a few years later in 1589.



"
785,"BUONTALENTI, Bernardo","(b. ca. 1531, Firenze, d. 1608, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buontale/biograph.html,"
Bernardo Buontalenti (Bernardo delle Girandole), Italian architect, engineer, designer, painter and inventor. He was one of the great Renaissance polymaths and was not only admired but also liked by his contemporaries. A friend of princes, he spent most of his life at the Tuscan court, but his influence stretched throughout Europe."
786,"BUORA, Giovanni di Antonio","(b. ca. 1450, Osteno, d. 1513, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buora/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He was born in the Lake Lugano region on the mainland, and worked in Venice from 1480 onward. He died in Venice. He made the columns and carved the capitals that define the three aisles in San Zaccaria, Venice. He also made the doorway of San Zaccaria, Venice. He appears frequently in the Venetian records, especially in association with Pietro Lombardo, in the construction of the Scuola di San Marco in Venice, in 1489 and 1490, after it caught fire in 1485. His name has been associated with the design of the graceful, early 15th-century Palazzo Michiel on the Fondamenta della Sensa in Canareggio. He probably worked with Mauro Codussi on the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo on the Grand Canal. Buora worked on the monastery building and cypress garden on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, now the Cini Foundation headquarters and exhibition space.



"
787,"BURCH, Hendrick van der","(b. 1627, Naaldwijk, d. after 1666, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burch/biograph.html,"
Hendrick van der Burch (also Burgh), Dutch painter. One of his sisters seems to have been Jannetje van der Burch, the wife of Pieter de Hooch, whose genre scenes of guardrooms, domestic interiors and courtyards closely resemble those of van der Burch. Van der Burch was living in Delft by 1642 and joined the Guild of St Luke in 1649. He cosigned documents with de Hooch in 1652, 1654 and 1655. Probably in imitation of de Hooch, van der Burch developed an interest in the expressive use of highly ordered, geometric space and sophisticated lighting effects, often employing a view to an adjoining space through a doorway or window. However, his command of perspective was never so certain and his lighting effects rarely so subtle as de Hooch's."
788,"BURCH, Cornelis Jansz. van der Burch",(active 1579-1614 in Delft),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burch_c/biograph.html,"
Dutch goldsmith. He was apprentice in Delft in 1579 and became a master goldsmith in 1591. He is recorded in Delft until 1614.

790,"BURGHAUSEN, Hans von","(b. ca. 1355, Burghausen, d. 1432, Landshut)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burghaus/biograph.html,"
German architect, also known as Hanns Purghauser. In the past, he has been incorrectly called Hans Stethaimer or Hans Stethaimer the Elder. He is considered the most important architect of the German-speaking area in the late 14th and the early 15th centuries, and the founder of the tradition of Late Gothic hall churches in southern Germany that lasted for more than a century."
791,"BURGKMAIR, Hans","(b. 1473, Augsburg, d. 1531, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burgkmai/biograph.html,"
German painter and designer of woodcuts. After learning his trade under Schongauer in Colmar, he had settled in his native Augsburg by 1498. Before then he is presumed to have been to Italy, for his paintings, with their warm glow of colour, their decorative classical motifs, and their intricate spatial composition, show how decisively he transformed his late Gothic heritage with Renaissance influence. Indeed, he occupied a place in Augsburg comparable to that of Dürer in Nuremberg in introducing the new style.

"
792,"BURGOS, Juan de",(active in 1450s in León),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burgos/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter active in mid-fifteenth century in León. There were several artists (painter, illuminator, sculptor) with the same name active in this period, lacking biographical details confusion can arise in the identification of the artist of a particular object.



"
793,"BÜRING, Johann Gottfried","(b. 1723, Hamburg, d. after 1788)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buring/biograph.html,"
German architect. He was responsible in Potsdam for the Neues Palais (New Palace, 1763-68), with a main elevation based on Vanbrugh's Castle Howard, Yorkshire; the Chinese Tea House (1755-64); and No. 5, Am Neuen Markt (1753-55), based on Palladio's Palazzo Thiene, Vicenza. He also worked with Johann Boumann (c. 1706-1776) on the building of St Hedwig's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Berlin (1772-73), and designed the exquisite picture-gallery at Sanssouci, Potsdam (1755-63), one of the first in the history of museums erected solely to exhibit paintings. He also designed the Nauener Tor in Berlin.

794,"BÜRKEL, Heinrich","(b. 1802, Pirmasens, d. 1869, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burkel/biograph.html,"
German painter, best known for his work in genre landscape painting. Born in the Palatinate, the artist studied in Munich and further learned through copying 17th century Dutch landscape paintings. Taking inspiration during a number of sojourns through Italy, Bürkel turned his attention to rustic scenes in country settings. His scenes of Italian and Bavarian country life were internationally in great demand."
795,"BURLAMACCHI, Eufrasia","(b. ca. 1482, Lucca, d. 1548, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burlamac/biograph.html,"

Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones was an English painter and decorative artist. He was the leading figure in the second phase of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and he was influenced by the art of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His paintings of subjects from medieval legend and Classical mythology and his designs for stained glass, tapestry and many other media played an important part in the Aesthetic Movement and the history of international Symbolism."
797,"BURTON, Decimus","(b. 1800, London, d. 1881, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/burton/biograph.html,"

798,"BURY, Friedrich","(b. 1761, Hanau, d. 1823, Aachen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bury/biograph.html,"
German painter and dealer. He was taught to draw by his father, Jean Jacques Bury (1731-85), a goldsmith and engraver born in Strasbourg, who also taught at the Hanau Zeichnenakademie. After taking painting lessons from Anton Wilhelm Tischbein (1730-1804), in 1780 Bury attended the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf, where he practised copying from the work of the Old Masters, especially Peter Paul Rubens, in the gallery belonging to the Elector Palatine Charles Theodore."
799,"BUSCH, Johann Joachim","(b. 1720, Schwerin, d. 1802, Plau am See)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/busch/biograph.html,"
German architect and sculptor. He came from a craftsman's family and entered the service of the Duke of Mecklenburg in 1748, where he worked under the French court architect Jean Laurent Legeay (c. 1710-1790). Little is known about his education, but he was able to gain an insight into the architecture of the eighteenth century, including the extensive library of his later client, Herzog Friedrich. In 1758 Busch was appointed court architect. In 1779, Busch was given the title of Court Director, and in 1796 he was retired with the title Oberhofbaurat and moved to relatives in Plau am See."
800,"BUSHNELL, John",(c. 1630-1701),https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/bushnell/biograph.html,"
English sculptor. He travelled in France and Italy where he executed the huge tomb (1660s) of Alvise Mocenigo in the church of Mendicanti, Venice. Having returned to London, he gained many commissions because of his Baroque style (a novelty in Britain), including a Sir Thomas Gresham for the Royal Exchange (now in the Old Bailey), and he would receive more but for his difficult and unstable temperament (he died insane). His work is extremely uneven in quality, but he is an important figure, for he showed untravelled Englishman for the first time something of the possibilities of Baroque sculpture.



"
801,"BUSIRI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1698, Roma, d. 1757, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/busiri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. His tentative beginnings c. 1720 as an amateur painter of perspectival and architectural vedute representing Rome and its environs are documented by, among other works, four paintings in tempera showing the Colosseum, the Piazza del Pantheon, the Pyramid of Cestius and the Ponte Rotto (all in private collection). Busiri preferred working in that medium rather than oil, and many of his finest tempera paintings were acquired by English and Scottish collectors in Rome during the 18th century."

Italian late-Mannerist painter, active mostly in Florence. He worked along with more famous figures as Alessandro Allori, Bernardino Poccetti or Santi di Tito in various large projects, including the decoration of certain ceilings of the Uffizi and the Grand Cloister of Santa Maria Novella. In 1589, the duke Ferdinando I commissioned the decoration of the Map Room and the Stanzino delle Matematiche, following a design by Stefano Buonsignori. There is a fresco by Buti on the Annunciation at the Basilica of the Virgin of Humility in Pistoia.

806,"BUTTERI, Giovanni Maria","(b. ca. 1540, Firenze, d. ca. 1606, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/butteri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After he trained under Agnolo Bronzino (as did his brother, Cresci Butteri; fl 1551-89), in 1564 he entered the newly founded Accademia del Disegno in Florence, in which he was very active. He worked mainly in Florence and for the Medici on commissions for paintings, decorations for buildings and court occasions (many untraced); these included Michelangelo the Poet with Apollo and the Muses for the funeral of the artist (1564) and Poets and Writers for the wedding (1565) of Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici's son Francesco (later Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany) and Joanna of Austria (1547-78). For the studiolo (Florence, Palazzo Vecchio) of Francesco I de' Medici he painted (1570-71) Aeneas Arriving in Italy and the Glassblowers' Workshop. He worked on a number of commissions under the supervision of another Bronzino protégé, Alessandro Allori, including decorations for the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano (1579-82), for the first corridor of the Galleria degli Uffizi (1581) in Florence and for the wedding of Grand Duke Ferdinand I de' Medici and Christine of Lorraine (1589), as well as cartoons (1590s) for the Arazzeria Medicea or tapestry works."
807,"BUYS, Jacobus","(b. 1724, Amsterdam, d. 1801, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buys/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and printmaker. He was the son of a wig-maker. Up to the age of 19 he worked for a solicitor. Both his employer's son and the poet and collector Sybrand Feitama encouraged him to take lessons with Cornelis Pronk and at the Amsterdam Drawing Academy. He studied, among other things, Jacob de Wit's work and, after further training with Cornelis Troost, established himself as an independent artist in 1745, enrolling in Amsterdam's Guild of St Luke in 1750."
808,"BUYSTER, Philippe de","(b. 1595, Antwerpen, d. 1688, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buyster/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, active in France. He studied in Antwerp under Gilles van Papenhoven (documented 1595-1616). When he was still young, he settled in Paris, where in 1632 he was appointed sculptor in ordinary to the king and given a residence in the Tuileries. He became a member of the Académie in 1651. His works include: the mausoleum of Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld, created for a chapel in the church of St Geneviève, the funerary statue of the bishop of Rueil in the cathedral at Angers, the statue of Marguerite de Crevecoeur, originally situated in the church of St-Germain-l'Auxerrois and now in the Louvre, a bust of cardinal de La Rochefoucauld and another of Le Camus, the bishop of Bellay. Buyster also produced a series of figures for the palace and gardens at Versailles - Neptune, Ceres, Bacchus, Momus, Flora, the Satirical Poem, along with several others.



"
809,"BUYTEWECH, Willem","(b. 1591/92, Rotterdam, d. 1625, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buytewec/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and engraver, nicknamed ""Geestige Willem"" (Witty Willem). He was active in his native Rotterdam and in Haarlem, where he was closely associated with Frans Hals. Although his surviving output as a painter is tiny, he is one of the most interesting artists during the first years of the great period of Dutch painting. His pictures of dandies, fashionable ladies, topers, and lusty wenches are among the most spirited Dutch genre scenes, and instituted the category known as the ""Merry Company"" (Merry Company, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam)."
810,"BUZZI, Ippolito","(b. ca. 1562, Viggiù, 1634, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/buzzi/biograph.html,"
Ippolito Buzzi (or Buzio) was an Italian sculptor from Viggiù, near Varese, in northernmost Lombardy, a member of a long-established dynasty of painters, sculptors and architects from the town, who passed his mature career in Rome. His personality as a sculptor is somewhat overshadowed by the two kinds of work he is known for: restorations to ancient Roman sculptures, some of them  highly improvisatory by modern standards, and sculpture contributed to architectural projects and funeral monuments, where he was one among a team of craftsmen working under the general direction of an architect in projects for Pope Clement VIII or for Pope Paul V - who would provide the designs from which the work was executed, always in consultation with the patron."
811,"BYSS, Johann Rudolf","(b. 1660, Solothurn, d. 1738, Würzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/b/byss/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter. He learned painting from Johann Heinrich Roos, whose sons he would have known well. He traveled to Germany, England and the Netherlands in the 1680s to study. In 1689, he became court painter to Count Hermann Jakob Cern."

French painter. He studied under the tutelage of two exponents of genre paintings, his father, Louis-Simon Cabaillot-Lassalle (b, 1810), and Pierre Edouard Frère (1819-1886). He frequently exhibited at the Salon between 1864 and 1889. Cabaillot-Lassalle specialised in painting domestic genres scenes chronicling the lives of middle-class women.


"
813,"CABANEL, Alexandre","(b. 1823, Montpellier, d. 1889, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabanel/biograph.html,"
French painter of portraits and historical subjects in the academic style. He entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the age of seventeen. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1844, and won the Prix de Rome in 1845. His painting The Birth of Venus was shown at the Salon in 1863, and was bought by Napoleon III for his own personal collection. That same year he was made a professor of the École des Beaux-Arts."
814,"CABAT, Louis-Nicolas","(b. 1812, Paris, d. 1893, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabat/biograph.html,"
French painter and engraver, a specialist in landscapes. He was one of the most illustrious students of Camille Flers (1802-1868). A member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, Cabat was elected a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France in 1867 and was director of the French Academy in Rome from 1879 to 1884."
815,"CABEL, Adriaan van der","(b. ca. 1630, Rijswijk, d. 1705, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabel/biograph.html,"
Adriaan van der Cabel (also Ary van der Kabel), Dutch painter and printmaker. He trained with Jan van Goyen in The Hague in the 1640s. His real name was Ary van der Touw (""of String""), but he changed it to Cabel (meaning ""of Cable"")."
816,"CABEZALERO, Juan Martín","(b. 1633, Almadén, d. 1673, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabezale/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He entered the studio of Juan Carreño de Miranda in Madrid as pupil and assistant and remained on close terms with his master, for in 1666 he was still living in Carreño's house. Palomino praises his modest and studious temperament and laments that he died young."
817,"CABIANCA, Vincenzo","(b. 1827, Verona, d. 1902, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabian_v/biograph.html,"
Italian painter belonging to the Macchiaioli group. He began his artistic training at the Verona Academy, and then studied at the Venice Academy from 1845-47. During the 1850s Cabianca became acquainted with the artists who frequented the Caffe Michelangiolo in Florence, who would soon be known as the Macchiaioli. He became a friend of Telemaco Signorini, whose influence led Cabianca to turn away from genre painting towards a bolder realism, beginning in 1858."
818,"CABIANCA, Francesco","(b. 1665, Venezia, d. 1737, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cabianca/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His first known work is the marble St Benedict (1695) for S Michele in Isola, Venice. Illness forced him to move around 1698 to Dalmatia, where he stayed at Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) and at Cattaro. There he completed the high altar with SS John, Dominic, Bruno and Chiara for S Chiara, an altar for S Giuseppe and the marble altar of the chapel of S Trifone for S Trifone. He returned to Venice in 1708 but retained contacts with Dalmatia."
819,"CACCIA, Guglielmo","(b. 1568, Montabone, d. 1625, Moncalvo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caccia/guglielm/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Il Moncalvo. One of the most important and prolific Piedmontese artists of the first quarter of the 17th century, Gugielmo Caccia was probably trained in Casale Monferrato before moving to Vercelli. There he absorbed the influences of Gaudenzio Ferrari and Bernardino Lanino, as is evident in his decoration of one of the chapels of the Sacro Monte at Crea, completed around 1590."
820,"CACCIA, Orsola Maddalena","(b. 1596, Moncalvo, d. 1676, Moncalvo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caccia/orsola/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. She was born Theodora Caccia in 1596 to the painter Guglielmo Caccia (1568-1625, also known as Il Moncalvo). In 1620 her name changed to Orsola Maddalena when she took her vows at the Convento delle Orsoline in Bianzè, Italy, a small municipality in the northern region of Piedmont. Five years later she moved to the Ursuline convent founded by her father in Moncalvo, the town in which she was born."
821,"CACCIANIGA, Francesco","(b. 1700, Milano, d. 1781, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cacciani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A diligent craftsman of little originality, he created art that derived from the traditions of classical Bologna and Baroque Rome. In 1717 he moved to Bologna, where he studied with Ferdinando Galli-Bibbiena and probably with Carlo Cignani and Marcantonio Franceschini. In 1719 he was commissioned by Conte Calderari to paint the Martyrdom of St Catherine (untraced) for the church of S Maria Beltrade (destroyed), Milan, and the same patron commissioned three biblical scenes for his Milanese palazzo. After this Caccianiga settled in Rome, where in 1727 he won first prize for drawing in a competition organized by the Accademia di S Luca with a Belshazzar's Feast (Rome, Galleria Accademia Nazionale di S. Luca). His painting of St Celso Triumphing over the Pagan Priests (1736-38) for the main chapel of SS Celso e Giuliano, Rome, demonstrates the influence of the proto-Neo-classical culture then fashionable in Rome. In 1740 Caccianiga was elected into both the Virtuosi del Pantheon and the Accademia di S Luca, in which he held various posts."
822,"CACCINI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1556, Roma, d. 1613, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caccini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He was the pupil and assistant of Giovanni Antonio Dosio and probably moved with his master from Rome to Florence in November 1575, spending the rest of his life in Florence. From Dosio he learnt the techniques of marble-carving, stucco and antique restoration and the principles of architecture, benefiting from Dosio's intense interest in Greek and Roman antiquity. He spent much of his early career engaged in the restoration of sculptures, although he also produced significant original work at this time. He had become fully established by the late 1590s, and his predominance as a sculptor in Florence was assured by the move of his rival, Pietro Francavilla, to France in 1601. Of a secondary nature, Caccini's rather obscurely documented work as an architect began in the 1590s and continued until his death.



"
823,"CACIALLI, Giuseppe","(b. 1770, Firenze, d. 1828, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cacialli/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and teacher. He studied architecture at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence together with Pasquale Poccianti (1774-1858) and Luigi de Cambray Digny (1778-1843); all three were pupils of the leading figure in Tuscan Neo-classicism, Gaspero Maria Paoletti (1727-1813). At barely 15 years of age Cacialli won the second prize for architecture with a measured drawing of the chapel of Sant'Andrea Corsini in the Florentine church of Santa Maria del Carmine. During the period of French rule in Tuscany, Cacialli rose to a position of prominence in Tuscan architectural affairs. After the restoration in 1814 of the House of Lorraine in Tuscany, he was appointed architect to the Scrittoio delle Reali Fabbriche, a position he held until he retired in January 1827."
824,"CADES, Giuseppe","(b. 1750, Roma, d. 1799, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cades/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained at Rome's Accademia di San Luca but left in 1766 when his master came to resent his excessive independence. When he received his first important commissions in the early 1770s, he employed a late Baroque classicist style inspired by Carlo Maratta. Around 1774, through his association with Johann Heinrich Fuseli's circle, he began adopting influences from Mannerist and Renaissance painting, as well as the antique."
825,"CADORIN, Ludovico","(b. 1824, Venezia, d. 1892, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cadorin/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and ornamentalist. He was the most capable interpreter of the neo-Rococo style in the Venice of the 1850s. This style was mixed in nonchalant abandon with Moorish and neo-Renaissance features. His best-known works are the decoration of the four rooms of the Caffè Florian on Piazza San Marco, opened to the public in July 1858.



"
826,"CAFFA, Melchiore","(b. 1635, Vittoriosa, d. 1667, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cafa/biograph.html,"
Maltese sculptor, whose name is given variously as Cafá or Gafá in Malta. He was the pupil and assistant of Ercole Ferrata, and was never either a pupil or assistant of Bernini, yet his style is similar in its astonishing virtuosity in the expression of religious ecstasy. His marble reliefs and figure groups display an exalted sensibility which exceeds even Bernini's own, and his masterpiece, the Ecstasy of St Catherine of Siena (Rome, Santa Caterina a Monte Magnanapoli) is obviously based on Bernini's St Teresa. Cafá's very short life - only 10 working years - meant that many of his works were finished by others. There are also works in Roman churches (Sant'Agostino and Sant'Agnese in Piazza Navona), in Lima, Peru and in Malta. A signed bronze bust of Alexander VII is in New York (Metropolitan Museum).



"
827,"CAFFI, Ippolito","(b. 1809, Belluno, d. 1866, at sea)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caffi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After training initially in Belluno (1821-25), then in Padua with his cousin Pietro Paoletti (1801-47), Caffi attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice (1827-31), studying under Teodoro Matteini (1754-1831), Francesco Bagnara (1784-1866) and Tranquillo Orsi (1771-1845). In 1832 he moved to Rome, acquiring immediate fame as a vedutista. He displayed a virtuoso command of spatial construction; in 1835 he published a textbook on perspective, Lezioni di prospettiva pratica, with Antonio Bianchini. Caffi modernized the veduta vocabulary inherited from Canaletto, selecting new points of view, and he showed an interest in nocturnal scenes with artificial or lunar illumination, in recording the effects of light and atmosphere at particular times, and in chronicling unusual events such as eclipses and balloon flights."
828,"CAFFI, Margherita","(b. ca. 1650, Vicenza, d. 1710, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caffi_m/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Around 30 flower paintings by her, dated between 1662 and 1700, have been identified (two of which are in Florence, Uffizi, and were damaged by the bomb in May 1993). Her father, Vincenzo Volo, and her husband, Francesco [?Lodovico] Caffi of Cremona, were both still-life painters. She was patronized by the Medici in Florence and by the Habsburgs in Madrid and Innsbruck, especially the latter, where she is said to have lived for an extensive period.

829,"CAFFIÉRI, Jean-Jacques","(b. 1725, Paris, d. 1792, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caffieri/jeanjacq/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, part of a French family of artists of Italian descent. Most of the family members were employed as sculptors in the naval yards (Le Havre and Brest). Jean-Jacques Caffiéri, became one of the most eminent sculptors of the second half of the 18th century, producing monumental works as well as small-scale allegorical groups and some of the liveliest and most elegant portrait busts of the time."
830,"CAFFIÉRI, Philippe","(b. 1714, Paris, d. 1774, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caffieri/philippe/biograph.html,"
Bronze-caster, collector and designer, part of a French family of artists of Italian descent. He was the eldest son of Jacques Caffiéri, one of the most celebrated bronzeworkers in the reign of Louis XV. His younger brother was Jean-Jacques Caffiéri, one of the most eminent sculptors of the second half of the 18th century, producing monumental works as well as small-scale allegorical groups and some of the liveliest and most elegant portrait busts of the time."
831,"CAGNACCI, Guido","(b. 1601, Sant'Arcangelo di Romagna, d. 1682, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cagnacci/biograph.html,"Cagnacci was an interesting Emilian painter of the mid-seventeenth century. Like many others from his region, he was actively involved in rediscovering classical Antiquity. He also holds a special place in the history of art because he moved to Vienna and so exported the latest classical style to the German-speaking world.

"
832,"CAGNOLA, Luigi","(b. 1762, Milano, d. 1833, Inverigo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cagnola/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He was sent at the age of fourteen to the Clementine College at Rome, and afterwards studied at the University of Pavia. He was intended for the legal profession, but his passion for architecture was too strong, and after holding some government posts at Milan, he entered as a competitor for the construction of the Porta Orientale. His designs were commended, but were not selected on account of the expense their adoption would have involved."
833,"CAILLEBOTTE, Gustave","(b. 1848, Paris, d. 1894, Gennevilliers)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caillebo/biograph.html,"
French painter and collector. Caillebotte's parents, of Norman descent, were wealthy members of the Parisian upper middle class, and his paintings often evoke his family background. After studying classics at the Lycée Louis Le Grand, he obtained a law degree in 1870, and during the Franco-Prussian War he was drafted into the Seine Garde Mobile (1870-71). He joined Léon Bonnat's studio in 1872 and passed the entrance examination for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts on 18 March 1873. The records of the Ecole make no mention of his work there, and his attendance seems to have been short-lived. He was very soon attracted by the innovative experiments, against academic teaching, of the young rebels who were to become known as the Impressionists."
834,"CAIN, Auguste Nicolas","(b. 1822, Paris, d. 1894, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cain/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, a prolific and successful member of the Animalier School. He worked under François Rude, Alexandre Guionnet (active 1831-1853) and Pierre-Jules Mêne, whose daughter he married, as was the tradition of Paris craftsmen at that time. They would marry their mentor's daughter, or even widow, in order to continue the family workshops and business with ease. Cain also worked in and used his father-in-law's foundry, where some of his larger models of animals were cast."
835,"CAIRO, Francesco del","(b. ca. 1598, Varese, d. 1665, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cairo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is known for his highly personal, if somewhat neurotic, portrayals of swooning female saints and heroines."
836,"CAJES, Eugenio","(b. 1575, Madrid, d. 1634, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cajes/eugenio/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and draughtsman of Italian descent, son of Patrizio Cajés who, together with Romulo Cincinnato in Rome in 1567, were engaged by the Ambassador to Philip III, to work at the Spanish royal court. Eugenio undoubtedly served his apprenticeship with his father, with whom he also collaborated on his earliest commissions. Eugenio Cajés's Meeting of Joachim and Anne (Madrid, Real Academia S Fernando) was probably painted for an altarpiece that his father contracted for in 1604. It reveals, in both the sense of monumentality and the rather mannered lines of the drapery, the influence of the fresco paintings carried out by Pellegrino Tibaldi at the Escorial.



"
837,"CAJÉS, Patrizio","(b. ca. 1540, Arezzo, d. 1612, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cajes/patrizio/biograph.html,"
Patrizio Cajés (also spelt Caxés or Cascesi), Italian painter and designer, active in Spain, father of Eugenio Cajés. He worked in Rome and Madrid. He arrived in Spain in 1567 and worked at the Alcázar, the Palacio del Pardo, and convents in the district of Madrid. He was one of the artists involved in the decoration of the monastery of San Lorenzo in El Escorial."
838,"CALAME, Alexandre","(b. 1810, Vevey, d. 1864, Menton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calame/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He studied under François Diday in Geneva and then travelled to Paris (1837), to the Netherlands and Düsseldorf (1838), to Italy (1844) and to London (1850). Despite his frail health he spent each summer painting in the mountains of the Bernese Oberland and central Switzerland, where he produced the drawings and studies from nature that were later used in his studio compositions. A fervent Calvinist, he saw his subjects - the grandiose forces of nature, stormy summits and torrents as well as calm lakes - as expressions of Divine power. He enjoyed success during his lifetime, partly due to a firm adherence to a conventional landscape painting tradition. A year after Calame's arrival in Paris, the artist exhibited a Vue prise dans la Vallée d'Ansasca, effet du soir, in the Paris Salon of 1841. That painting was purchased by King Louis-Philippe and according to Calame's memoirs hung in, ""...le salon précédant la Salle du Trône aux Tuileries"". That painting, however, now hangs in the Assemblée National, Paris."
839,"CALCAR, Jan Steven van","(b. ca. 1499, Calcar, d. ca. 1546, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calcar/biograph.html,"
Jan Steven [Johannes Stephanus] van Calcar, North Netherlandish painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. He was a pupil of Titian's in Venice, c. 1536 or 1537, though not necessarily the pupil referred to as 'Stefano' by Marcantonio Michiel in 1532. Van Calcar spent most of his working life in Italy, travelling to Venice and throughout Emilia Romagna, before finally settling in Naples."
840,"CALENDARIO, Filippo","(b. before 1315, ?, d. 1355, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calendar/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor (also spelt Kalandario). Reliable Venetian chronicles from the 15th century onwards not only praise him as the architect of the Doge's Palace in Venice and as a sculptor but also record that the Venetian government ('Signoria dogal') valued his advice when building palaces, towers and other public works. He was the most important sculptor and architect of the 14th century in Venice, although no building other than the Doge's Palace can now be attributed to him.



"
841,"CALIARI, Benedetto","(b. 1538, Verona, d. 1598, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caliari/benedett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters. The most accomplished member of the family, Paolo Caliari, is better known as Paolo Veronese, from his birthplace. After his death in 1588, his workshop was run by his brother Benedetto Caliari and his sons Carlo Caliari and Gabriele Caliari (1568-1631), using the signature Haeredes Pauli. Only one signed work by Gabriele is known: an altarpiece of the Virgin and St Anne (Liettoli, parish church); its physical types are related to Veronese's but are rather awkward and heavy."
842,"CALIARI, Carlo","(b. ca. 1567, Venezia, d. ca. 1592, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caliari/carlo/biograph.html,"

843,"CALLET, Antoine-François","(b. 1741, Paris, d. 1823, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/callet/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied under Antoine Boizot, attending drawing classes at the Académie Royale. In 1764, with his painting Epponina and Sabinus Condemned by Vespasian (Paris, Ecole Normale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts), he won the Prix de Rome, which allowed him to complete his artistic education at the Académie de France in Rome. Callet remained in Italy until 1772, when he executed a ceiling painting for the ballroom of the Palazzo Spinola in Genoa, which shows the influence of Veronese and the Bolognese school."
844,"CALLOIGNE, Jan Robert","(b. 1775, Bruges, d. 1830, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calloign/biograph.html,"
Flemish Neoclassical sculptor and architect. He studied at the Academies of Bruges and Ghent, and later in Paris with Antoine Chaudet. He went to Rome by winning the Prix de Rome in 1807. He returned to Bruges in 1811 and was named architect of the town and director of the Academy in 1814. He was the official sculptor of King William I."
845,"CALLOT, Jacques","(b. 1592, Nancy, d. 1635, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/callot/biograph.html,"
French engraver and draughtsman. He went to Italy when he was in his teens and, working in Rome and then in Florence at the court of the Grand Duke Cosimo II, he learnt to combine the sophisticated techniques and exaggerations of late Mannerism with witty and acute observation into a brilliantly expressive idiom. In 1621 he returned to France, and most of the remainder of his career was spent in his native Nancy, although he worked in Paris and the Low Countries. "
846,"CALRAET, Abraham van","(b. 1642, Dordrecht, d. 1722, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calraet/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the eldest son of Pieter Jansz. van Calraet (c. 1620-81), a sculptor from Utrecht. According to Houbraken, Abraham was taught by the Dordrecht sculptors Aemilius and Samuel Huppe, although nothing is known of his activity as a sculptor. Houbraken also stated that Abraham learnt to paint figures and fruit and that his brother Barent van Calraet (1649-1737), who specialized at first in horse paintings but later imitated the Rhine landscapes of Herman Saftleven, was a pupil of Aelbert Cuyp. The known signed works by Barent confirm this. A painting of two horses in a stable, initialled APK (Rotterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), indicates that Abraham, too, must have been well acquainted with Cuyp and provides the basis for identifying Abraham's painting style. A large number of landscapes with horses, paintings of livestock in stables and still-lifes, all initialled A.C. and formerly attributed to Aelbert Cuyp, are now generally considered to be the work of van Calraet, although many of these are in fact copies after him.



"
847,"CALS, Adolphe-Félix","(b. 1810, Paris, d. 1880, Honfleur)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cals/biograph.html,"
French painter. After taking some printmaking and drawing lessons, he entered the studio of Cogniet at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1828. His academic training resulted in a warm palette and an attention to detail, but at the same time he also developed an unusual interest in depicting the wretched existence of the poor. In the 1830s he went his own course and mostly painted landscapes around Paris."
848,"CALSTER, Maarten van","(b. ca. 1574, Mechelen, d. 1628, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calster/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. In 1594 he became master as image cutters and upholsterer. He specialized in decorated crosses. He was active in Mechelen, Lier and Edegem.

Italian painter, biographer, draughtsman and engraver, called Il Sordino. He was a pupil of Giuseppe Varotti (1715-1780). While a student at the Accademia Clementina, Bologna, he received two awards, including the Premio Marsili for the Sacrifice of Noah (1758; Accademia di Belle Arti, Bologna). He pursued literary interests throughout his life and became a member of the avant-garde Accademia Letteraria degli 'Ingomiti' in Bologna in 1763."
851,"CALZA, Antonio","(b. 1653, Verona, d. 1725, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/calza/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His father was a jeweler. He was the pupil of the Bolognese painter Carlo Cignani, then moved to Rome to work under Jacques Courtois. Calza, who worked mostly in Bologna, is known for painting historical and battle paintings."
852,CAMAINO DI CRESCENTINO,"(b. ca. 1260, Siena, d. ca. 1337, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/camaino/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, father of the well-known Tino di Camaino. Between 1299 and 1317, he is documented in Siena as the capomaestro (master builder) of the Duomo, creating the upper part of the façade. Between 1317 and 1325 he built the Baptistry of St. John of the Cathedral of Siena.



"
853,"CAMASSEI, Andrea","(b. 1602, Bevagna, d. 1649, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/camassei/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. He was first recorded in Rome in 1626 and was apparently trained there by Domenichino. His earliest surviving commission is the decoration of the chapel of St Philip Neri in Santa Margarita, Bevagna, with canvases showing scenes from the life of the saint (1627; in situ). In 1628 he worked with Andrea Sacchi, under Pietro da Cortona, on the decoration of the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano."
854,"CAMBIASO, Luca","(b. 1527, Genova, d. 1585, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cambiaso/biograph.html,"Genoese painter. He was a precocious artist (his highly accomplished frescos in the Doria Palace, now the Prefettura, in Genoa were done in 1544, when he was only 17) and he became the dominating figure in 16th century Genoese painting, running a large and productive workshop. His style derives from Michelangelo in the massiveness of his figures and Correggio in the softness of his modelling, but the use of dry paint and the simplification of forms are his own. The latter is particularly noticeable in his drawings, which often utilize geometrical forms that give them a superficially Cubist look. Another curious instance of antecedence is apparent in his night scenes, which have been claimed as sources for Georges de La Tour, even though it is not clear by what route they could have become known to him. In 1583 Luca accepted an invitation from Philip II of Spain to work on decorations at the Escorial. He died there in 1585 and was succeeded by Federico Zuccaro and then Pellegrino Tibaldi.

Italian sculptor. His family came from Gattinara in Piedmont - a town famous for its engravers - and he served a long apprenticeship in the workshop of Lorenzo Ottoni in Rome. His first known works are the marble relief of the Canonization of St Ignatius (1695-98; Rome, the Gesù, chapel of S Ignazio), based on a design provided by Andrea Pozzo, and the monument to Count Vladislav Constantine Wasa (1698-1700; Rome, Stimmate di S Francesco), commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Albani (later Clement XI). In the Lazio region Cametti was also active at Frascati, where he produced a relief (1704) for the façade of the cathedral; and at Palestrina, with the funerary monuments to Prince Taddeo Barberini and Cardinal Antonio Barberini (both 1704; S Rosalia), where he experimented with a new concept in tomb design which he used again in the monument to Gabriele Filippucci (c. 1706; Rome, S Giovanni in Laterano).



"
857,"CAMILLIANI, Francesco",(d. 1586),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/camillia/father/biograph.html,"
Francesco Camilliani was an Italian sculptor in Florence, a pupil of Baccio Bandinelli. His son, Camillo Camilliani was also a sculptor. In the 1550s Francesco executed a fountain for the Florentine villa of Don Pedro Álvarez de Toledo. This had been sold to the city of Palermo by Pedro's son Luigi di Toledo, to be erected in the newly built Piazza Pretoria in front of the Palazzo Senatorio. It was much praised by Vasari and represented the introduction of Mannerist sculpture to Palermo.



"
858,"CAMILLIANI, Camillo","(active ca. 1574, d. ca. 1603, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/camillia/son/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, military engineer, and architect, son of Francesco Camilliani, a pupil of Baccio Bandinelli. He moved to Palermo from Florence in 1574, to assemble and enlarge (with the collaboration of Michelangelo Naccherino) the fountain executed in the 1550s by his father for the Florentine villa of Pietro di Toledo. This had been sold to the city of Palermo by Pietro's son Luigi di Toledo, to be erected in the newly built Piazza Pretoria in front of the Palazzo Senatorio. It was much praised by Vasari and represented the introduction of Mannerist sculpture to Palermo."
859,"CAMILO, Francisco","(b. 1615, Madrid, d. 1673, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/camilo/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter of Italian origin. His father was Italian and his mother Spanish. Her second husband, Pedro de las Cuevas, ran an excellent school of painting and drawing in Madrid, where Camilo trained along with many contemporary artists. Here Camilo would have been aware of the changes in painting that occurred c. 1630-40 as a result of the diffusion of prints by Peter Paul Rubens and the arrival at the court of paintings commissioned from Rubens by Philip IV. These made a deep impression on the Madrid school. With Francisco Rizi, Camilo was the earliest exponent of the High Baroque style in Madrid."
860,"CAMMARANO, Michele","(b. 1835, Napoli, d. 1920, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cammaran/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He came from a family of artists of Catalan origin and was taught by his grandfather Giuseppe (1766-1850) and his great-uncle Antonio before enrolling at the Naples Accademia di Belle Arti in 1853. He studied under Gabriele Smargiassi (1798-1882), an exponent of traditional, composed, Romantic landscape, but was soon impressed by the plein-air landscape painting of Giacinto Gigante and by the work of the landscape painters of the Scuola di Posilippo, Alessandro La Volpe (c. 1820-1887) and Vincenzo Franceschini (1812-1885)."
861,"CAMPAGNA, Girolamo","(b. ca. 1549, Verona, d. 1625, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/campagna/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was one of the most important sculptors working in Venice and the surrounding region in the late 16th century and the early 17th. Although his older rival Alessandro Vittoria was a more versatile artist, Campagna's talents centred on a remarkable gift for religious statuary. In this he was unrivalled in Venice and scarcely equalled elsewhere in Italy."
862,"CAMPAGNOLA, Domenico","(b. 1500, Venezia, d. 1564, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/campagno/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver of German origin. He was the son of a German artisan, but he probably learned from his adopted father, Giulio Campagnola, who instructed him in painting, drawing, engraving, and woodcutting. After his father's death around 1516, Campagnola was Venice's foremost printmaker. He innovated by cutting woodblocks himself rather than employing a professional woodcutter. His earliest prints and drawings show the influence of Albrecht Dürer. Campagnola's lush, flowing style and religious subject matter may also indicate access to Titian's workshop."
863,"CAMPAÑA, Pedro de","(b. 1503, Bruxelles, d. 1580, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/campana/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, active mainly in Seville and known by the Spanish form of his name rather than the Flemish one, Pieter de Kempeneer. Before settling in Seville he had worked in Italy and he exercised a strong influence in Andalusia as a pioneer of Mannerism and the style of Raphael. Several of his paintings are in Seville Cathedral. In 1562 he left Spain to direct a tapestry factory at Brussels, his native city.

864,"CAMPEN, Jacob van","(b. 1596, Haarlem, d. 1657, Amersfoort)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/campen/biograph.html,"
Dutch architect, one of the leaders of a group of architects who created a restrained architectural style that was suited to the social and political climate of the Netherlands. He was born in Haarlem on 2 February 1596 as the son of Gerritge Claes Jansz Berendr and the merchant Pieter Jacobsz. As both his parents' families were wealthy burghers, Van Campen had good connections in the business and cultural worlds of Amsterdam and Haarlem."

Catalan sculptor and teacher. He began studying at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de la Lonja in Barcelona at the age of 14, and he worked in the studio of Salvador Gurri (fl 1756-1819), a late Baroque sculptor with Neo-classical tendencies. Campeny left the studio after he was attacked by Gurri, who, as a teacher at the Escuela (1785), continued to persecute him and threw him out. Campeny then worked in Lérida, Cervera and Montserrat. He produced his first major work, St Bruno (1795; destroyed 1831), in carved polychromed wood. He also trained with Nicolás Traver and José Cabaneras, both late Baroque artists."

The Campi were a family of Italian painters in Cremona in the 16th century. In the north of Italy, where they had the splendid example of the Venetians and some knowledge of Flemish and German art, the contrasts of light and shade could express the Mannerist feeling perfectly, as in the work of the Campi at Cremona."

Spanish painter. The son of a silversmith, he was apprenticed between 1619 and 1624 to Luis Tristán de Escamilla in Toledo, where he became acquainted with developments in the new genre of still-life. He was examined and certified as maestro pintor in Seville in June 1630, after which his activity there as a painter is documented with regularity. His earliest dated painting and only known religious work is a signed Magdalene (1634; Seville, El Salvador). In 1660, together with Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, Francisco de Herrera the Younger and Juan de Valdés Leal, he was among the founders of the Academia de Bellas Artes."

Italian painter, part of a family of dealers, collectors and painters. He was the brother of Pietro Camuccini (1760-1833), also a painter. From an early age Vincenzo was assisted and encouraged by Pietro, who had given up his place in the studio of Domenico Corvi (1721-1803) to Vincenzo. The younger brother's earliest known painting, the Sacrifice of Noah (1785; Cantalupo in Sabina, Palazzo Camuccini), is a competent work demonstrating his use of Corvi's technique of chiaroscuro."

Italian painter, the father of Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio Canal). He was a celebrated painter of theatrical scenery and opera sets, working with his brother, Cristoforo. However, he painted a few 'vedute', too, all dated from the 1730s. Canaletto's early work develops from that of his father, and eclipses it very rapidly in the early 1720s."

874,"CANAL, Giambattista","(b. 1745, Venezia, d. 1825, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canalgia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, son of the painter Fabio Canal (1703-1767). He was known throughout the Veneto region for the incredible speed of execution of frescoes on very large surfaces."
875,"CANAVESIO, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1451, Pinerolo, d. after 1500)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canavesi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and priest. He was born in Piedmont, and was active in Liguria and on the French side of the Alps. The 1450 workshop archives in Pinerolo (where he was registered as a ""master artist"") state that he traveled a great deal along the Maritime Alps, signing and dating his works."
876,"CANDID, Peter","(b. ca. 1548, Brugge, d. 1628, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/candid/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter (originally Pieter de Witte), tapestry designer and draughtsman, active in Italy and Germany. He was one of several Italian-trained Mannerist artists employed by the courts of Europe and was the leading figure in Munich from 1600 to 1628. His versatility led Sandrart to describe him as a 'universal painter'."
877,"CANE, Ottaviano","(b. before 1495, Trino Vercellese, d. 1575, Trino Vercellese)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cane/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is widely documented in Trino, and his pictorial corpus is homogeneous and consist, despite over forty years of documented activity. His first work as an independent painter was commissioned in 1523 by the Brotherhood of Angels at Trino. In 1534 he worked in Casale where he seems to enjoy a reputation similar to that of Gaudenzio Ferrari. Nothing has remained of his youthful works."
878,"CANELLA, Giuseppe","(b. 1788, Verona, d. 1847, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canella/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists. The head of the family, Giovanni Canella (1750-1847) was a fairly important architect who worked in a Classical style. He enrolled his two sons in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia to study the style of painting that was most fashionable at the time. For his younger son, Carlo Canella (1800-1880), the time spent in Venice was short and from there he was off to study with Giovanni Migliara at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. For Giuseppe, on the other hand, the years spent in Venice became a way to compare his work to that of Venetian masters from the 1700s. He chose to insert himself into an imaginary line that started with Guardi and continued on to Bison and Tranquillo Orsi. His landscapes tend to be a lyrical note jotted from reality in opposition to the exact reproductions inspired by Canaletto's work as interpreted by Vincenzo Chilone and his school, the most famous in Venice in the early 1800's."
879,"CANEVALE, Isidore","(b. 1730, Vincennes, d. 1786, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canevale/biograph.html,"
French architect, active in Austria-Hungary. He was a representative of the so-called ""Revolutionary Architecture,"" a style named after the novel, radical conceptions of its creators."
880,"CANO, Alonso","(b. 1601, Granada, d. 1667, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cano/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor, painter, architect, and draughtsman, sometimes called ""the Spanish Michelangelo"" because of the diversity of his talents. "
881,"CANOVA, Antonio","(b. 1757, Possagno, d. 1822, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canova/biograph.html,"Italian sculptor. Called ""the supreme minister of beauty"" and ""a unique and truly divine man"" by contemporaries, Antonio Canova was considered the greatest sculptor of his time. He was brought up as a mason and already had his own studio, in Venice, by 1774. He became the most famous Neoclassical sculptor whose international reputation surpassed even those of Flaxman, Thorvaldsen and Gibson.

"
882,"CANTARINI, Simone","(b. 1612, Pesaro, d. 1648, Pesaro)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cantarin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver. He was one of the most eminent pupils of Guido Reni and one of the most gifted engravers in the tradition of the Carracci. He had a strong personality and developed a highly original style, which united aspects of Bolognese classicism with a bold naturalism.



"
883,"CANTOFOLI, Ginevra","(b. 1618, Bologna, d. 1672, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cantofol/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, collaborator of Elisabetta Sirani in Bologna. She painted works for several churches in Bologna, including a Last Supper for the Church of San Procolo and a St Thomas of Villanova for San Giacomo Maggiore.



"
884,"CANUTI, Domenico Maria","(b. 1625, Bologna, d. 1684, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/canuti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After training in Bologna under Guido Reni, Guercino, Giovanni Andrea Sirani and Francesco Gessi (1588-1649), he was in Rome from 1651 to 1655 under the patronage of Abbot Taddeo Pepoli, a distinguished Bolognese scholar. His Bolognese origins, specifically a debt to Reni and the Carracci, are apparent in the Ecstasy of St Cecilia (Imola, Santa Maria di Valverde), considered to be his first work. The Universal Judgment (Bologna, San Girolamo della Certosa), signed and dated 1658, shows the development of a more Baroque style. That he was also aware of Venetian painting is apparent in his first ceiling fresco, the Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne (c. 1664; Bologna, Palazzo Fibbia, now Masetti-Calzolari), executed in collaboration with the quadraturista Domenico Santi, called Mengazzino (1621-1694). Here Canuti tried to conceal any distinction between the real space of the hall and his illusionistic spatial cone traversed by bands of radiating light."
885,"CAPANNA, Puccio",(active 1338-1348 in Assisi),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/capanna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Vasari described him as one of Giotto's most important pupils, but he identified him with the painter Puccio di Simone who is documented in Florence, although he included among the works attributed to this artist numerous paintings in Assisi and noted that the inhabitants of Assisi considered him to be a fellow citizen. A document of 1341, however, confirms the existence of an Assisi painter named Puccio di Capanna: the authorities commissioned 'Puccius Cappanej et Cecce Saraceni, pictores de Assisio' to paint images of the Virgin and Child with Saints on the 'Porta externa platee nove' and the 'Porta Sancti Ruphini'. Puccio Capanna is also documented in Assisi in 1347. He died in Assisi from the plague in 1348."
886,"CAPELLI, Camillo di","(active 1514, d. 1568, Venice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/capelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Camillo Mantovano. He was active between 1514 and 1568 in Mantua, but also in Venice, where he died, having worked with Giuseppe Salviati (Giuseppe Porta).



"
887,"CAPET, Marie-Gabrielle","(b. 1761, Lyon, d. 1818, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/capet/biograph.html,"
French painter, the daughter of a servant. In 1781, she went to Paris to learn painting under the direction of Adélaide Labille-Guiard. In 1781, her first drawings and pastels were exhibited at the Salon de la Jeunesse. In 1783, her mastery of oil paint allowed her to submit her first self-painted oil painting."
888,"CAPORALI, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1420, Perugia, d. 1505, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caporali/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo di Segnolo Caporali (also Caporale) was an Italian painter mainly active in Perugia. He seems to have been working as a painter in Perugia by 1442 but is first documented on 24 December 1454, when he received payment for a Pietà and a Maestà (both untraced) executed for the shoemakers' guild in Perugia. In 1457-58 he was treasurer of the painters' guild, and in 1462 he was elected a civic prior for March and April. On 6 May 1467 he received payment, in Rome, for gilding the ceiling of San Marco. On 18 July of the same year he and Benedetto Bonfigli were paid by the merchant Lancillotto di Ludovico to execute a panel for the chapel of San Vincenzo in San Domenico, Perugia (untraced), and on 14 July the following year they received the balance due for their finished work. Fra Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli profoundly influenced his work."
889,"CAPPELLA, Francesco","(b. 1711, Venezia, d. 1774, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cappella/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Daggiù, one of the most famous student of Piazzetta. His first notable painting is the Madonna and Saints from 1740 (San Marco della Pietà, Venice). The Beheading of St Eurosia can be dated after 1744 (Udine, Museo Civico), after 1744 he worked in the church Sant'Andrea in Cortona on the altarpiece Immaculate Conception with St Margaret. In 1749 he executed three paintings for the parochial church in Alzano Maggiore (Triumph of the Cross, St Apollonia, St Lucy), then in 1757 a Magdalen in the same church. In 1757, invited by the Count Giacomo Carrara, he moved to Bergamo where the majority of his later works can be found: Self-Portrait (Galleria Carrara), Christ on the Way to Calvary (1774), The Martyrdom of St Catherine, David and the Lion (all in Sant'Alessandro della Croce), Pentecost (in Santa Maria della Pace), Sts Augustine and Monica (in Santo Spirito).



"
890,"CAPPELLE, Jan van de","(b. 1626, Amsterdam, d. 1679, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cappelle/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine and landscape painter. He was a wealthy Amsterdam dyer who taught himself to paint during his spare time, but there is nothing of the Sunday painter in this work. Typically his paintings show handsome vessels on calm rivers or seas; they have a grandeur of composition, a limpid quality of light, and an exquisite sense of tonality that places them among the finest marine paintings of any time or place. Cappelle also painted winter landscapes and beach scenes. His work is rare; the best collection is in the National Gallery in London. He was affluent enough to make a distinguished art collection.



"
891,"CAPPONI, Luigi di Pietro",(active 1485-1500 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/capponi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active in quattrocento Rome with an oeuvre still quite unclear and undefined. He was born and, more than likely, trained in Milan (possibly in the workshop of Giovanni Antonio Amadeo) and went to Rome in the 1480s. He is first mentioned there in connection with the tomb of Francesco Brusati in the church of San Clemente in a document of July 8, 1485. Another document (March 8, 1496) links his name to the marble altar with the Crucifixion in the church of Santa Maria della Consolazione. Further documentation is unknown. However, on the basis of these two works, a substantial oeuvre has been ascribed to the Lombard sculptor.



"
892,"CAPRIOLO, Domenico","(b. 1494, Venezia, d. 1528, Treviso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/capriolo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He moved from Venice to Treviso c. 1517, where he is well documented (though there is little about his painting). In 1518-19 he married Camilla, daughter of the painter Pier Maria Pennacchi. A coherent body of work executed between 1518 and 1528 has been reconstructed."
893,"CARACCIOLO, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1578, Napoli, d. 1635, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caraccio/biograph.html,"
Neapolitan painter, called Battistello. He was one of the greatest Caravaggio's followers, and his powerful work was an important factor in making Naples a stronghold of the Caravaggesque style. He only appe/red on the Neapolitan art scene when he was 30, in the first decade of the seventeenth century when Caravaggio was working in the city. A group of paintings commissioned for Neapolitan churches reveals that he could interpret intelligently Caravaggio's realism. He used strong chiaroscuro backgrounds against which sculpturally defined figures stood out.

"
894,"CARADOSSI, Vittorio","(b. 1861, Firenze, d. 1918, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carados/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He studied sculpture under Augusto Rivalta (1837-1925) at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. His genre epitomizes fin-de-siecle Tuscan sculpture. Technically superb, most of his oeuvre is dominated by highly-decorative groups and single nude figures in various symbolic or allegorical guises. He is renowned for his large sensuous nudes, but was also commissioned for numerous important public monuments. His most famous is the monument to the Renaissance artist Desiderio da Settignano, and the model for this was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900."
895,CARADOSSO,"(b. ca. 1452, Modonico, d. 1527, ?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caradoss/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith, coin- and gem-engraver, jeweller, medallist and dealer (originally Cristoforo Foppa). Son of the goldsmith Gian Maffeo Foppa, from 1480 he served at the Milanese court with his father, eventually becoming personal goldsmith and jeweller to Ludovico Sforza (il Moro), Duke of Milan. In 1487 Caradosso was in Florence, where his appraisal of an antique cornelian was highly esteemed. He worked in Hungary in the service of King Matthias Corvinus, probably in August 1489; a later visit to the court was cut short by the King's death (1490)."
896,"CARAGLIO, Giovanni Jacopo","(b. 1500/05, Verona, d. 1565, Krakow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caraglio/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver and designer, known also as Jacobus Parmensis or Jacobus Veronensis. He was a pupil of Marcantonio Raimondi in Rome and achieved distinction as an engraver on copper and, later, as a designer of medals and engraver of gems. In Rome, the printer and publisher Baviera introduced him to Rosso Fiorentino, whose allegory Fury he engraved. Caraglio continued to collaborate with Rosso and engraved several suites, two after Rosso and eighteen after Perino del Vaga. After the Sack of Rome (1527), Caraglio took refuge in Venice, where he made engravings after Titian. His presence is recorded there until 1537. By 1539 he was in Poland, probably at the recommendation of his friend Pietro Aretino, who had contacts in the court of Bona Sforza (1494-1557), wife of Sigismund I, King of Poland. By 1545 Caraglio entered the service of the King as goldsmith, medallist and engraver of hardstones."
897,"CARATTI, Francesco","(b. ca. 1615, Bissone, d. 1677, Prague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caratti/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He worked in Bohemia from 1652 and was one of the most important early Baroque architects there. He worked for nobility and the church as well. He was influenced by north Italian and Viennese architecture. His buildings are uniquely monumental. His most important work is the Cernin Palace in Prague.


"
898,CARAVAGGIO,"(b. 1571, Caravaggio, d. 1610, Porto Ercole)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caravagg/biograph.html,"
Caravaggio, byname of Michelangelo Merisi, Italian painter whose revolutionary technique of tenebrism, or dramatic, selective illumination of form out of deep shadow, became a hallmark of Baroque painting. Scorning the traditional idealized interpretation of religious subjects, he took his models from the streets and painted them realistically. His three paintings of St Matthew (c. 1597-1602) caused a sensation and were followed by such masterpieces as The Supper at Emmaus (1601-02) and Death of the Virgin (1605-06).

"
899,"CARBAJAL, Luis de","(b. 1531, Toledo, d. ca. 1621)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carbajal/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was the brother of the sculptor and architect Juan Bautista Monegro, and pupil of Juan de Villoldo. At the age of 21 years, he was working with his master in the Archbishop's chapel in Toledo. He was then named painter for King Phillip II of Spain. He painted some lesser works for the monastery in the Escorial. In 1570, for the church of the Escorial, he painted seven large canvases pairing various saints. He also decorated two oratories in the cloister of the Evangelists."
900,"CARCANI, Filippo",(active 1657-1686 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carcani/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor called Il Filippone. The young Carcani assisted Ercole Ferrata and devoted himself to stucco and marble work. Later he became one of Bernini's disciples."
901,"CARDUCHO, Bartolomé","(b. 1554, Firenze, d. 1608, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carducho/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Vicente Carducho (c.1576-1638) was a Spanish painter and writer on art. He was a Florentine by birth (his name was originally Vincenzo Carducci), but he settled in Spain when he was 9, when his elder brother, Bartolomé Carducho (originally Bartolommeo Carducci, c.1560-1608), went to the Escorial in 1585 as assistant to Federico Zuccaro. Vincente was appointed a court painter in Madrid in 1609, and had a successful and prolific career, but he is now remembered mainly for his book Dialogos de la Pintura (1633). In this he defended the heroic Italian tradition (championing Michelangelo in particular), and excoriated the naturalism of Caravaggio. In a sense this was an attack on Velázquez, who had completely eclipsed Carducho at court."
902,"CARDUCHO, Vicente","(b. 1576, Florence, d. 1638, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carducho/vicente/biograph.html,"

903,CARIANI,"(b. 1485, Venezia, d. 1547, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cariani/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Busi, called Cariani, was a Bergamasque, but worked principally in Venice. He was perhaps a pupil of Giovanni Bellini and Palma Vecchio, but was also influenced by Giorgione, Titian and Lotto. In turn, some of his works foreshadow his fellow-Bergamasque, Caravaggio. Some frescoes have recently been discovered in the citadel, Bergamo. Other works are in the Royal Collection, Windsor, and in Bergamo and other museums.



"
904,"CARLEVARIS, Luca","(b. 1663, Udine, d. 1730, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carlevar/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, engraver and architect, his name also spelled Carlevarijs. He is regarded as the father of 18th-century Venetian view-painting (veduta), for although he was not (as sometimes asserted) the first to specialize in the genre, he approached it with a new seriousness, his training as a mathematician being reflected in his rigorous perspective settings. Carlevaris's artistic inclinations were probably inherited from his father, a painter and designer who died when his son was very young.

"
905,"CARLEVARIS, Marianna","(b. 1703, Venezia, d. ca. 1750, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carlevax/biograph.html,"
Marianna Carlevaris (also spelt Carlevarijs) was an Italian painter. She was the daughter of Luca Carlevaris who is regarded as the father of 18th-century Venetian view-painting (veduta). She was the pupil of Rosalba Carriera and also a pastelist.

908,"CARLONE, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1603, Genova, d. 1684, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carlone/giovbatt/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of an Italian family of artists, son of Taddeo Carlone (1543–1615), a sculptor, and brother of the painter Giovanni Carlone (1584-1630). He probably went to Rome with his brother and studied in Florence with Domenico Passignano on the way back to Genoa. The many frescoes datable to the 1620s suggest that the brothers probably worked as a team. Giovanni Battista's independent activity is not documented before 1630-32, when he finished the frescoes begun by his brother in S Antonio Abate in Milan. His earliest dated work is a canvas of St James Opening the Door for King Ferdinand (1632; Genoa, oratory of S Giacomo della Marina), which shows figures with sharp facial features and twisting, tight drapery folds - a figure style indebted to Salvator Rosa and distinctly different from the slightly swollen faces and hands in the figures by Giovanni Carlone I."
909,"CARLONE, Carlo Innocenzo","(b. 1686, Scaria, d. 1775, Como)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carlone2/carlo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Diego Francesco Carlone. He was apprenticed at the age of 12 to Giulio Quaglio II (1668-1751) in Venice. After 1700 he worked with Quaglio in Udine and Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), and from 1706 to 1711 he continued his studies in Rome, at the workshop of Francesco Trevisani and at the Accademia di San Luca. He was also influenced by the work of leading Italian 17th-century painters: he made a careful study of works by Pietro da Cortona, Luca Giordano, Francesco Solimena and others."

Italian stuccoist, part of a family of artists, son of Giovanni Battista Carlone II. He learnt his trade in his father's workshop in Passau Cathedral. About 1695 he was in Rome, and in 1701 he worked at the Salesian church at Amberg and the Carmelite church at Straubing. By then he was already in charge of his father's firm, with Paolo Allio I (1655-1729) as his leading collaborator; they worked together until 1720. In 1702 the workshop provided stucco decorations for the pilgrimage church of Mariahilf, near Amberg, and in 1704-05 for the abbey church at St Florian, Upper Austria, and for the collegiate church in Salzburg."

He was active mainly in Germany, particularly in Passau, where he contributed to the decoration of the new cathedral and the church of St Michael. With him appeared a new type of stucco which does not alter the architectural lines but constitutes a flowering ornamental around them.



"
913,"CARMONTELLE, Louis Carrogis de","(b. 1717, Paris, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carmonte/biograph.html,"
French painter and writer, also known as Louis Carrogis. He is noted for having created portraits and caricatures of the French nobility, courtiers, distinguished guests to noble households, and soldiers. He is also noted for having painted panoramas 'en transparence' for projection in a magic lantern. He was the designer of one of the earliest examples of the French landscape garden, Parc Monceau in Paris."
914,"CARNERI, Mattia","(b. 1592, Trento, d. 1673, Trento)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carneri/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, active in Trento, Innsbruck and Venice. His father was a painter and sculptor, and he early started an artistic career in Trento. In 1624 and again in 1625 he was commissioned to erect some temporary structures (triumphal arches) to honour the passage of the Archduke of Austria; of course, nothing remains of this activity."
915,"CARNEVALE, Fra","(b. ca. 1425, Urbino, d. 1484, Urbino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carneval/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Bartolomeo di Giovanni Corradini. His name, Fra Carnevale, is translated Brother Lent (after the 40-day, Christian liturgical season of solemn fasting before Easter Sunday, commemorating the day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ)."

917,"CARNOVALI, Giovanni","(b. 1804, Montegrino, d. 1873, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carnoval/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Il Piccio. He was sponsored by Conte Giovanni Spini to study at the Accademia Carrara, Bergamo. Here Carnevali was subject not only to the influence of his teacher, the Neo-classical painter Giuseppe Diotti (1779-1846), a former pupil of Andrea Appiani, but also to the great variety of Venetian Old Master paintings available to him in the academy's collection. Carnovali rapidly became one of Bergamo's most sought-after portrait painters, his work being much in demand among the intellectual elite of the town, such as Giovanni Maironi da Ponte (1826) and Conte Guglielmo Lochis (1835; both Accademia Carrara, Bergamo). His first public commission was the Education of the Virgin (1826) for the parish church of Almenno S Bartolomeo, near Bergamo. The altarpiece clearly shows the influence of Appiani, while for his portraits Moretto da Brescia and Giovanni Battista Moroni were also an important source of inspiration."
918,"CARO, Baldassare de","(b. 1689, Napoli, d. 1750, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Naples. He specialized in still-lifes, mainly dead games, but painted also flower pieces. He was a pupil of Andrea Belvedere, an active figure of the Neapolitan school of still-life painting represented by Paolo Porpora and Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo. Baldassere de Caro was also influenced by Spanish Bodegones and Flemish painters such as Frans Snyders, Jan Fyt and Abraham Brueghel. "

Charles Auguste Émile Durand, known as Carolus-Duran, French painter. He came from a humble background and by the age of 11 was taking lessons at the Académie in Lille from the sculptor Augustin-Phidias Cadet de Beaupré (b. 1800) who taught him to sketch. At 15 he began a two-year apprenticeship in the studio of one of David's former pupils, François Souchon (1787-1857), whose name he still referred to several years later when he exhibited at the Salon. In 1853 he moved to Paris. He copied in the Louvre where he must have met Henri Fantin-Latour, then taking life classes at the Académie Suisse (1859-60)."

He is one of the few French painters of his time with a distinctive artistic personality, and his work reflects the refined but unstable atmosphere of the Valois court during the Wars of Religion (1560-98). He worked at Fontainebleau under Primaticcio in the 1540s and later became court painter to Catherine de Médicis, wife of Henry II of France."
921,"CAROSELLI, Angelo","(b. 1585, Roma, d. 1652, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carosell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a talented artist who perhaps is more famous now for his copies and pastiches of other artists work than for his own. For some years Caroselli had worked in a very stylized Caravaggesque manner peculiar to his himself, producing works of great quality, such as Allegory of Vanity (Longhi Collection, Florence) and Lesbia Mourning her Pet Sparrow (private collection). Up to around 1630 it becomes very hard to distinguish the work of Caroselli and his pupil Pietro Paolini whilst they were both working in this 'Carosellian' Caravaggesque manner."
922,"CAROTO, Giovanni Francesco","(b. 1488, Verona, d. after 1562)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caroto/biograph.html,"
Caroto (also Carotis) was a pupil of Liberale to whom he remained true in his early work. In Mantua, he came into personal contact with Mantegna, which lead to a modification of his style. He also adopted ideas from Titian and Raphael. Berenson describes him as an eclecticist. His great pupil, Veronese, seems to have benefited from this.



"
923,"CARPACCIO, Vittore","(b. 1472, Venezia, d. 1526, Capodistria)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carpacci/biograph.html,"Venetian painter. His life is poorly documented, and it is not known with whom he trained, but it is generally agreed that the chief influence on his work was Gentile Bellini. This is especially apparent in the first of the two great cycles of paintings that are his chief claim to fame - the Scenes from the Life of St Ursula, executed in the 1490s and now in the Accademia, Venice. Carpaccio's distinguishing characteristics — his taste for anecdote, and his eye for the crowded detail of the Venetian scene — found their happiest expression in these paintings. Especially original is the painting Dream of Saint Ursula. His other cycle, Scenes from the Lives of St George and St Jerome, painted for the Scuola (or 'Society') of S. Giorgio degli Schiavone, Venice, in 1502-07 (still in the Scuola), combines fantasy with detail minutely observed. The two best-known paintings of this cycle are Saint George Slaying the Dragon and Saint Augustin in His Study.
"
924,"CARPEAUX, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1827, Valenciennes, d. 1875, Courbevoie)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carpeaux/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was a pupil of Rude, whose influence he combined with the Romanticism of Barye; he was also a precursor of Rodin and Medardo Rosso in the importance he attached to chiaroscuro in sculpture. He went to Italy in 1854 and made his name with a dramatic statue of Ugolino, before returning to Paris in 1862. His most famous works were a pediment for the Pavilion de Flore of the Louvre, begun in 1863, and the Dance, begun in 1865 for the new Opera House in Paris. This caused a great sensation, and was attacked on moral grounds - it was even suggested that the group should be removed. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 prevented this, but the original is now in the Musée d'Orsay and has been replaced by a copy on the Opera. A variant of the principal figure is now in Detroit."
925,"CARPI, Girolamo da","(b. 1501, Ferrara, d. 1556, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carpi/biograph.html,"
Girolamo da Carpi (original name Girolamo Sellari) was an Italian painter of the Ferrarese school. According to Vasari he had apprenticeship under Garofalo whose style he did not adopt, however. He orientated towards Correggio, Parmigianino, Raphael, and in particular Dosso, to whom he was probably also an assistant. At Ferrara, after Dosso's outburst of Venetian and northern fantasy and Benvenuto da Garofalo's classicism, Carpi enriched the local tradition with echoes of Michelangelo.

926,"CARPIONI, Giulio","(b. 1613, Venezia, d. 1678, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carpioni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher. He was a pupil of Alessandro Varotari, through whom he was drawn to the early works of Titian, though he also responded to the Venetian Caravaggesque works of Carlo Saraceni and Jean Leclerc. Around 1631 he and Varotari made a brief visit to Bergamo, where he came into contact with Lombard art. On his return to Venice he became acquainted with Pietro della Vecchia; the etchings of Simone Cantarini and Odoardo Fialetti as well as Nicolas Poussin's bacchic scenes (through the etchings of Pietro Testa) were further influences."

932,"CARRADORI, Francesco","(b. 1747, Pistoia, d. 1824, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/carrador/biograph.html,"
Francesco Carradori was an Italian sculptor, restorer, and instructor of sculpture at the Accademia in Florence from 1786 to 1821. His training made him a significant representative of the rather difficult passage of the Florentine plastic arts in the Neoclassical direction. His instructions for students of sculpture, published in 1802, are vital to understanding the art and craft of sculpting as they were practiced before the twentieth century. This book is the most comprehensive and instructive and includes thirteen articles that explain how to restore marble sculpture, model clay, work with stucco and wax, cast and finish bronze, and carve and enlarge models into marble and stone, as well as seventeen plates that illustrate the arrangement, methods, and tools used in each of these processes.

In 1840 Pierre-Jean David d'Angers sponsored him for the École des Beaux-Arts. He stayed only briefly, moving to the Petite École to study decorative arts instead. Between 1850 and 1855, Carrier-Belleuse worked in England, designing ceramics and metalwork models for companies like Wedgwood. From 1857 he exhibited large-scale sculptures at the Salon, where he garnered medals and commissions from important patrons.

She painted snuff boxes for the tourist trade with miniatures on ivory, a technique she seems to have pioneered as against the earlier use of card as a ground. She was painting miniatures by 1700, and her earliest pastels are of c. 1703. In 1705 she was made an 'accademico di merito' by the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, a title reserved for non-Roman artists. She achieved immense popularity, and made pastel portraits of notabilities from all over Europe, She also had great success with her near-pornographic demi-vierges, much earlier examples of the genre than those by Greuze. She went blind at the end of her life, which provoked a mental collapse. There are 157 of her pastels in Dresden, and others in the Royal Collection, London (Victoria and Albert Museum) and elsewhere.

He next studied painting under Joseph Christophe (1662-1748) and François Lemoyne and then completed his studies in engraving under Nicolas-Henry Tardieu. In 1729 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale and on 31 December 1733 was received (reçu), on presentation of the engraved portraits of Michel Anguier after Gabriel Revel and of Sébastien Bourdon after Hyacinthe Rigaud.

Danish-born German draughtsman and painter. Apart from some initial training at the Copenhagen Academy he was largely self-educated. He moved to Berlin in 1787 and taught at the Academy. After 1792 he lived in Rome with the help of a grant from the Prussian State. Carstens was totally committed to Neoclassicism and concentrated on heroic figure compositions. He was uninterested in colour and was much more prolific as a draughtsman than as a painter. His work has a pompous seriousness in tune with his own inflated idea of his genius, but he is a significant figure because of the strictness of his ideals and the influence he had on the next generation of artists, notably Thorvaldsen and the Nazarenes."

In 1684 he was enrolled in the guild of Venetian painters. After the death of Justus Sustermans (1681), the official portraitist of the Medici court, Cassana tried to win favour by sending a Self-Portrait (1683) to Florence to form part of the collection of self-portraits in the Uffizi. Yet this work, the earliest example of his prolific output as a portrait painter, was rejected and relegated to the gallery's storeroom.

Painter and draughtsman, son of the painter Bernardo Castello and the nephew of Giovanni Battista Castello. He was one of the leading Ligurian painters of the 17th century, whose art developed from a continuous and passionate study of a wide range of sources. His paintings of mythological and religious subjects unite an elegant figure style with an interest in dramatic and violent compositions; his touch is spontaneous and his palette vibrant with reds and pinks, blues and yellows. His brilliant decorative frescoes introduced the splendour of the High Baroque to Genoese painters. He was well known for his rapid oil sketches, with light and lively brushwork, which anticipate aspects of the Rococo. His lively frescoes of glowing colour and dramatic illusionism in various Genoese palaces made him most famous. His style united elegant figures with dramatic, violent compositions composed of spontaneous brushwork and vibrant colours."

Spanish painter, one of Seville's leading painters of the 1630s and 1640s. Little is known about his life, documents establish the boundaries of his career as 1611 and 1650. Scholars also know that he was related by marriage to painter Alonso Cano, his Sevillan peer, and to Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, who became Castillo's apprentice. Castillo's painting derived from that of Francisco Pacheco and other Sevillian masters of the late 16th century and early 17th, his Sevillan predecessors influenced Castillo's warm palette. He was later influenced by the naturalism and warmer palette of Juan de Roelas and by the many examples of Italian painting, especially Venetian, circulating in Seville at the time. The naturalism that distinguished his manner derived from the Venetian paintings that were relatively abundant in Seville."

Castillo was a Spanish painter active in Cordova, who was a pupil of his uncle Juan (1584-1640), who had himself been a pupil of Zurbarán and was the master also of Murillo. Antonio was therefore much influenced by Zurbarán's dramatic sobriety, as well as by Netherlandish engravers such as Bloemaert, whose genre treatment of religious themes influenced Castillo. His earliest work (St Jerome, Madrid, Prado) is dated 1635. He also painted portraits and landscapes, and was the master of Valdés Leal. There are works in Cordova, Madrid and Munich.

Italian gem carver. The art of the pietra dura mosaics evolved in Rome and was almost immediately transferred to Florence, from where Francesco I de' Medici gave Emperor Rudolph II one of the first works produced in his new workshop in 1589. It was so much liked by the Emperor that he commissioned a second from the workshop which took six and a half years to complete and incorporated stones from Bohemia which he had had sent to Florence. The design also seems to have been strongly influenced by his court as it is stylistically atypical for a work Florentine panel. By 1592 Rudolph II had already secured the transfer of Cosimo Castrucci, from Florence to Prague."

In 1811 he moved to Italy, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Initially he wavered between Joseph Anton Koch's classically heroic style of landscape painting and the Romantic lyricism of the Nazarenes. Eventually he found that he could best exercise his technical ability, and most quickly achieve fame and fortune, by producing Italian landscapes. He specialized in Neapolitan scenes depicting festive folk customs; and such paintings proved popular with the mass of wealthy travellers who came to Italy after the Napoleonic Wars.



"
967,"CATENA, Vincenzo","(b. ca. 1480, Venezia, d. 1531, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/catena/biograph.html,"
Venetian painter of religious subjects and portraits. Catena was a man of good birth and independent means who moved in humanist circles and may have been the link between these circles and Giorgione. He is first mentioned in 1506 in an inscription on the back of Giorgione's portrait Laura (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), according to which they had entered into some kind of partnership. Nothing else is known of this arrangement. The main influence on his style was Giovanni Bellini. His early paintings can be awkward and stiff, but from c. 1510 his work matured under the influence of the late Bellini, Cima, and Titian into a style that was derivative but handsome, with pleasing handling of diffused light and warm colours.



"
968,"CATI DA IESI, Pasquale","(b. ca. 1550, Iesi, d. ca. 1620, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cati/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was born in Iesi (Jesi) in the province of Ancona, but was active mostly in Rome. He moved from his native city to Rome, where he was known as a follower, if not pupil, of Michelangelo, and later of Federico Zuccaro. Among his works are frescoes in the Remigius chapel of San Luigi dei Francesi, frescoes depicting the life of the titular saint in San Lorenzo in Panisperna, and in walls and vault in the Altemps chapel in Santa Maria in Trastevere. On the wall of the Altemps Chapel to the left of the apse is his large painting depicting the assembled clergy for the Council of Trent (the ""Council of the Counter Reformation""), which was kicked off by Farnese Pope Paul III in 1545."
969,"CATLIN, George","(b. 1796, Wilkes-Barre, d. 1872, Jersey City)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/catlin/biograph.html,"
American painter, traveler and writer. Following a brief career as a lawyer, he produced two major collections of paintings of American Indians and published a series of books chronicling his travels among the native peoples of North, Central and South America. Claiming his interest in America's 'vanishing race' was sparked by a visiting American Indian delegation in Philadelphia, he set out to record the appearance and customs of America's native people."
970,"CATS, Jacob","(b. 1741, Altona, d. 1799, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cats/biograph.html,"
Dutch draughtsman and painter. He was the son of Johannes Cats, a Dutch bookdealer who moved back to Amsterdam from Germany following the death of his second wife shortly after Jacob's birth. Jacob was trained as a bookbinder and as an engraver, first under Abraham Starre and later with Pieter Louw (d 1800). After further training with the pattern designer Gerard van Rossum (c. 1690-1772), he became a wallpaper painter in the Amsterdam factory of Jan Hendrik Troost van Groenendoelen, for whom he worked for three and a half years. Cats then established his own wallpaper factory, with financial assistance from his relative Willem Writs and from Jan de Bosch and Johann Goll van Franckenstein the elder."
971,"CATTANEO, Danese",(c. 1512-1573),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cattaneo/biograph.html,"
Cattaneo was a Tuscan sculptor. His family lived in the mountains of Carrara and was connected with the marble trade. According to Vasari he was a pupil of Jacopo Sansovino in Rome; after the Sack (1527) he accompanied his master to Venice, where he worked on tombs, some figures on the Library, and the right-hand panel of the Loggetta."
972,"CAULLERY, Louis de","(b. ca. 1580, Caulery, d. 1621, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caullery/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, a pioneer in the genre of courtly gatherings in Flemish painting of the 17th century. He probably came from the village of Caullery near Cambrai, but moved to Antwerp in 1594 to train with Joos de Momper and was accepted as a Master there in 1602. While the date he went to Italy in uncertain, his works reveal that he spent time in Venice, Florence and Rome. He was particularly interested in genre painting and dealt with a high variety of scenes: carnivals on ice, fireworks, bull-fights, open-air entertainments, allegories of the five senses and get-togethers in the spirit of the Fontainebleau School. His figures are particularly elongated and strike elegant poses and are generally characterised with smooth pale faces and broad foreheads. His colour palette reveals the influence of the Italian painters: half tones, ocher-yellow, Veronese green and Burgundy red. He was particularly interested in the depiction of architecture and was skillful in representing his figures and their settings in perspective.



"
973,"CAUSICI, Enrico","(b. 1790, Verona, d. 1835, Havana)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/causici/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. Little is known from the life of the artist, except that he came from Verona, Italy, was presumably a pupil of Canova, and died in Cuba. Between 1822 and 1832 he was in the United States, where he left behind a number of reliefs and statues as well as an equestrian statue of George Washington erected in Baltimore in 1826. Between 1823 and 1827 he was engaged on developing reliefs for the Capitol in Washington.



"
974,"CAVALETTO, Giovanni Battista",(active 1486-1523 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavalett/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator, painter and sculptor. He was principally active as an illuminator and ran a workshop of considerable repute in Bologna. In 1486 he collaborated with Martino da Modena on the decoration of choir-books for San Petronio, Bologna, and this contact with Martino undoubtedly influenced his style. In 1509 and 1511 and then in 1522 and 1523 he and his collaborators received payments for the illumination of a number of choir-books for the same church (Museo San Petronio, Bologna)."
975,"CAVALIERI, Giovanni Battista de'","(b. ca. 1525, Trento, d. 1601, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavalier/biograph.html,"
Italian printmaker. He is known for repertories of engravings that reflect the antiquarian interests of his patrons, who were the high clergy of the Counter-Reformation Church in Rome. His style of engraving resembles that of Enea Vico, although inferior to it. Many of his plates are copies after the great Italian masters; they are etched, and finished with the graver. His plates number nearly 380.



"
976,"CAVALLI, Gian Marco","(b. ca, 1454, Viadana, d. after 1508)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavalli/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, sculptor and goldsmith. He was the son of a notary, Andrea Cavalli. First recorded as a goldsmith in June 1481, he executed the foot of a large tabernacle dedicated to the feast of Corpus Christi for Mantua cathedral between 1483 and 1485 and a large crucifix for the chapter house of the cathedral (1490-91); none of this work survives. In 1497 Cavalli probably began working for the Mantuan mint. The commissions from Ludovico Gonzaga, Bishop of Mantua, date from 1499 and 1501: a bronze statuette of the Spinario and four silver roundels with Signs of the Zodiac."
977,"CAVALLINI, Pietro",(active 1273-1308 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavallin/biograph.html,"
"
978,"CAVALLINO, Bernardo","(b. 1616, Napoli, d. ca. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavallio/biograph.html,"
Neapolitan painter. He was the most individual and sensitive Neapolitan painter of his time, but his career is somewhat obscure. About eighty paintings by him are extant, but only one is dated, St Cecilia in Ecstasy (Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, 1645; a modello is in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). Most of his pictures are small-scale religious works, peopled by exquisitely elegant and refined figures who evoke a feeling of tender melancholy. Their fragile sensitivity is in complete contrast to the earthy vigour of much of Neapolitan painting of his period. Cavallino trained with Massimo Stanzione, but his style has more in common with that of Van Dyck, whose work was fairly well known in Naples. He is presumed to have died in the plague that devastated Naples in 1656.



"
979,"CAVALORI, Mirabello","(b. 1535, Salincorno, d. 1572, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavalori/biograph.html,"
Mirabello d'Antonio di Pacino Cavalori (Mirabello di Salincorno), Italian painter. He was one of the founders of the Accademia del Disegno in Florence and worked on the academy's first major projects: the decorations for Michelangelo's funeral in S Lorenzo (1564) and for Duke Francesco I de' Medici's wedding (1565) to Joanna of Austria. For Michelangelo's catafalque he collaborated with Girolamo Macchietti on a grisaille painting of Lorenzo de' Medici Receiving Michelangelo (untraced); for the Arch of Religion, a temporary structure erected along the route of Francesco I's wedding procession, Cavalori painted in monochrome St Francis Founding the Retreat at Vernia and Receiving the Stigmata (untraced)."
980,"CAVAROZZI, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1590, Viterbo, d. 1625, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavarozz/biograph.html,"Italian painter, a native of Viterbo, who settled at a relatively early age in Rome, where, he stayed with the Viterbese painter Tarquinio Ligustri, who proved instrumental in acquainting the artist with the aristocratic Crescenzi family. This introduction not only brought Cavarozzi into contact with an eminent family of patrons, but also friendship with the painter and architect Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, who had trained in the studio of Pomarancio and who would later, in 1617-19, take Cavarozzi to Spain. Cavarozzi moved into the Crescenzi palace near the Pantheon and his close connection with this family led to his being nicknamed ""Bartolomeo del Crescenzi"".

"
981,CAVAZZOLA,"(b. ca. 1486, Verona, d. 1522, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavazzol/biograph.html,"
Cavazzola, actually Paolo Morando, Italian painter in Verona. He was an assistant to Francesco Morone. He moved stylistically between Bellini (imparted by his tutor) and the Lombards (Foppa, Solario). Orientation towards Mantegnesque models in his composition, and also towards Raphael in later years, can be observed.



"
982,"CAVEDONE, Giacomo","(b. 1577, Sassuolo, d. 1660, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavedone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He is best known for his monumental altarpieces but he also executed numerous frescoes and narrative easel paintings. Except for his late Self-Portrait (early 1630s; Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), all of the 92 extant paintings and frescoes are religious."
983,"CAVELIER, Jules","(b. 1814, Paris, d. 1894, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavelier/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. His father was a designer of bronzes, silverware and furniture. He began his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1831 as the pupil of David d'Angers and Paul Delaroche. At twenty-two he obtained the second grand Rome premium, at twenty-eight the first prize for a figure of Diomede capturing the Palladium. He exhibited at the Salon in 1842 a Conqueror at the Olympic Games; in 1849 the famous statue of Penelope Asleep, which Duke Luynes bought for the Castle of Dampierre, and obtained the Honour Medal and a pension of 4.000f. At the Salon of 1852 he exhibited a statue of Truth, which was bought for the Luxembourg Gallery, at the Universal Exposition of 1855, a Cornelia, a Bacchante, and a remarkable bust."
984,"CAVINO, Giovanni da","(b. 1500, Padova, d. 1570, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavino/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist and goldsmith. His entire career seems to have been spent in Padua, where he benefited from rich traditions of sculpture, bronze-casting, classical studies and collecting. His artistic training appears to have been acquired in the workshop of Andrea Riccio, who named Cavino as one of the executors of his will."
985,"CAVRIOLI, Francesco","(b. ca. 1600, Serravalle, d. 1670, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cavrioli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was a collaborator of Baldassare Longhena, and like some other Venetian sculptors of the first half of the seventeenth century. provided his altars with statues in marble and bronze. The decorative vein and a craftsman-like meticulousness are constant in Cavrioli's work, which included from the very beginning small works in stucco (now lost), as well as small bronzes such as the putto for the keystone of the altar (possibly by Longhena) of Francesco Morosini in the church of San Pietro in Castello (1646-47) and the three gilded bronze compartments in which Faith, Hope, and Charity are depicted on the altar of Blessed Lorenzo Giuliani in the same church (1650s). As a collaborator of Longhena, in 1645 Cavrioli made the allegorical statue of Venice for the central niche of the staircase of the monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore."
986,"CAYLINA, Paolo the Elder","(b. ca. 1425, Brescia, d. after 1486)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caylina/paolo1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also called Paolo da Brescia, active mainly in Brescia. According to a document of 1451, he lived in Brescia in the district of S. Agata. In 1458 he is documented as ""civis et habitator civitatis Brixiae"", together with Foppa, in Pavia, in an act for a regulation of accounts with a certain Nicolò de Francesco. In the same year he signed the polyptych with the Virgin and Child Enthroned between Saints (in the churches of S. Albino and then of S. Lorenzo in Mortara, Pavia, now in the Galleria Sabauda, Turin)."
987,"CAYLINA, Paolo the Younger","(b. ca. 1485, Brescia, d. ca. 1545, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/caylina/paolo2/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the nephew of both Vincenzo Foppa and Paolo Caylina the Elder, and son of Bartolomeo Caylina (active 1489-1503). He was called in the past with different names (Paolo Foppa, Paolo Zoppo, Vincenzo Foppa il Giovane), and works by him were attributed to other artists (Vincenzo Foppa, Floriano Ferramola, Moretto, Romanino) and vice versa, but today his small oeuvre is clearly identified."
988,"CAYOT, Claude-Augustin","(b. 1677, Paris, d. 1722, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cayot/biograph.html,"
Claude-Augustin Cayot (also spelt Caillot), French sculptor. He may have been trained by the elderly Etienne Le Hongre, but his supple and graceful style better reflects his long association with Corneille van Clève and is typical of the work produced by the sculptors working in France in the last decades of Louis XIV's reign and during the Régence period. He executed decorative work at the Château Neuf de Meudon, Hauts-de-Seine (1706-07; destroyed), and works in stone and bronze for the chapel of the château of Versailles (1709-10; in situ). He was received (reçu) into the Académie Royale in 1711 with a dramatic marble statuette of Dido Taking her Life (Paris, Louvre), and in 1713-15 he supplied gilt-bronze ornaments for the high altar of Notre-Dame, Paris, in conjunction with François-Antoine Vassé (1681-1736) under the direction of Robert de Cotte. In 1718 he carved a delightful Rococo marble statue of a nymph for the series Companions of Diana (Cliveden, Bucks, NT) for the gardens of the château of Marly, Yvelines. The small marble group of Cupid and Psyche (London, Wallace Collection), long attributed to Cayot, is now generally thought to be by Filippo della Valle.


"
989,"CAZES, Pierre-Jacques","(b. 1676, Paris, d. 1754, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cazes/biograph.html,"
French painter. His first tutor was a certain Ferou, concierge of the Académie Royale, Paris; he then trained with René-Antoine Houasse and Bon Boullogne. Having come second in the Prix de Rome competition of 1698 with Joseph's Cup Found in Benjamin's Belongings, in 1699 he won the first prize with a Vision of Jacob in Egypt (both untraced). He did not go to Rome, however, remaining in Paris to become one of the leading painters of large religious compositions and history paintings. He was received (reçu) at the Académie Royale in 1703 with a Triumph of Hercules over Achelous and made his début at the Salon in 1704 with a St Cecilia (both untraced)."
990,"CAZIN, Jean-Charles","(b. 1841, Samer, d. 1901, Lavandou)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cazin/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of artists. The painter and ceramicist Jean-Charles Cazin and his wife, Marie Cazin (1845-1924), a sculptor and decorative artist, represent a wide range of artistic involvement characteristic of the late 19th-century movement to unify the arts. Their son Michel Cazin (b. 1869) was active as a medallist, sculptor, ceramicist and printmaker."
991,"CECCARELLI, Naddo",(active 1340s in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ceccarel/biograph.html,"
Naddo (also Nardo) Ceccarelli was a Late Gothic Italian painter belonging to the Sienese school. Due to lack of historical or written sources, little is known of his life and work. Knowledge of his existence is based solely on two paintings signed by him, one of which is dated 1347, one year before the devastating plague. His signature also provides information concerning his origin in Siena."
992,CECCO DA CARAVAGGIO,(active in the 1610s in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cecco/biograph.html,"
Mancini, in his 'Considerazioni sulla Pittura' of c. 1620, mentions a 'Francesco detto del Caravaggio' as an admirer and imitator of Caravaggio. In a document of 1619 a 'Cecco' - an abbreviation of Francesco - is recorded among French artists working with Tassi at Bagnaia in 1613-15. he is therefore believed to be French (or at least Northern), which is supported by his hard, coarsely realistic style, with exaggerated facial expressions and elaborate still-life attributes. His works are datable c. 1610.

"
993,CECCO BRAVO,"(b. 1601, Firenze, d. 1661, Innsbruck)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cecco_br/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, originally Francesco Montelatici. Late 20th-century scholarship has nominated him the most original and exploratory Florentine painter of the 17th century. He learnt the fundamentals of his drawing technique from Giovanni Bilivert and was also close to Sigismondo Coccapani (1583-1642). In the early 1620s he took part in the vast collective projects carried out under the direction of Matteo Rosselli and by 1629 was the head of a workshop."
994,CECCO DI PIETRO,(active 1370-1399 in Pisa),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cecco_p/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A leading Pisan painter of the late 14th century, Cecco is first documented in 1370, when he helped restore frescoes in the Camposanto, borrowings from which sometimes inform his own work. In 1374 he signed a panel of St Simon Enthroned (lost) and in 1377 his earliest extant work, the triptych of the Pietà with Six Saints (Museo Nazionale di San Matteo, Pisa). The elegant melancholy of the saints and the pathos of the central group are typical of his whole oeuvre. Stylistic changes between this and his latest surviving signed and dated works, the polyptych of the Crucifixion with Saints (Museo Nazionale di San Matteo, Pisa) and a Virgin and Child with Donors (Portland Art Museum, Portland, OR), both of 1386, are hardly extensive, and the full pattern of his overall development remains unclear."
995,"CELESTI, Andrea","(b. 1637, Venezia, d. 1712, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/celesti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained first with Matteo Ponzoni, then with Sebastiano Mazzoni; Mazzoni encouraged the development of a Baroque style, but Celesti was also attracted by the naturalism of the tenebrists. The first known works by Celesti are mature in style, and he had already achieved considerable fame in Venice when the Doge Alvise Contarini honoured him with the title of Cavaliere in 1681."
996,"CELLIER, Jacques","(b. ca. 1550, ?, d. 1620, Reims)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cellier/biograph.html,"
French draftsman and organist in the Cathedral of Laon, and later in the Cathedral of Reims. He executed two manuscripts, one in 1583-87 for the daughter of Charles IX, and another in 1593-97 for Claude de Lisle, governor of Laon. Both are decorated with drawings of musical instruments, monuments, and various decorative motifs.



"
997,"CELLINI, Benvenuto","(b. 1500, Firenze, d. 1571, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cellini/biograph.html,"Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and metal-worker. His autobiography, written in a racy vernacular, has been famous since the 18th century (it was first published in 1728) for its vivid picture of a Renaissance craftsman proud of his skill and independence, boastful of his feats in art, love, and war, quarrelsome, superstitious, and devoted to the great tradition embodied in Michelangelo. It has given him a wider reputation than could have come from his artistic work alone; but to modern eyes he also appears as one of the most important Mannerist sculptors, and his statue Perseus is one of the glories of Florentine art.

"
998,CENNI di Francesco di Ser Cenni,(active 1369-1415 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cenni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was registered in the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, Florence, in March 1369. His only signed work is the fresco of 1410 in the chapel of the oratory of the Croce di Giorno attached to S Francesco, Volterra. However, dated works attributed to him suggest that his oeuvre was quite large and that stylistically he was of an eclectic nature."
999,"CERESA, Carlo","(b. 1609, San Giovanni Bianco, nr Bergamo, d. 1670, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ceresa/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was most distinguished as a portrait painter and represents the link between Giovanni Battista Moroni and the 18th-century paintings of Giacomo Ceruti and Giuseppe Ghislandi."
1000,"CEREZO, Mateo the Younger","(b. 1637, Burgos, d. 1666, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cerezo/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He first trained with his father, Mateo Cerezo the Elder, a painter of devotional images, and then completed his training in Madrid, where he arrived c. 1654. He is said to have studied with Juan Carreño de Miranda or possibly with Antonio de Pereda. Between 1656 and 1659 Cerezo worked in Valladolid and Burgos, returning permanently to Madrid c. 1660. His short career showed a precocious talent, and he rapidly absorbed the techniques of Carreño and of such contemporary painters as Francisco de Herrera the Younger. He was inspired by Titian and the refined elegance of Anthony van Dyck, and his varied, warm palette made him one of the most sensitive and refined colourists of the late Madrid school.



"
1001,"CERNOTTO, Stefano",(active 1530-1542 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cernotto/biograph.html,"
Dalmatian painter, born probably in Rab Island, Croatia, active in Venice. He  was repeatedly mistaken for Francesco Vecellio or Polidoro da Lanciano. Contrary to earlier assumption that he was a pupil of Bonifacio Veronese, recent research proved that he was trained in the shop of Titian around 1520. A fairly consistent corpus of Cernotto was compiled.



"
1002,"CERQUOZZI, Michelangelo","(b. 1602, Roma, d. 1660, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cerquozz/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, known as 'Michelangelo of the Battle' because of his predilection for battle scenes. He spent all his career in Rome, but had considerable contact with Northern painters; his friendship with the Dutchman Pieter van Laer led to his becoming the leading Italian exponent of bambocciate (small pictures low-life and peasant scenes). He also painted small religious and mythological works and still-lifes."
1003,"CERRINI, Giovanni Domenico","(b. 1609, Perugia, d. 1681, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cerrini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was trained by Giovanni Antonio Scaramuccia (1580-1633). Towards the mid-1630s he moved to Rome. His art owes much to Bolognese classicism and, in his last period, to Carlo Maratti. Most of Cerrini's paintings are undated, and, since his style apparently developed little, a chronology on stylistic grounds is hard to establish."
1004,"CERUTI, Giacomo","(b. 1698, Milano, d. 1767, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ceruti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of the so-called Lombard Painters of Reality (i.e. low-life). He is now known to have been born in Milan, where he died, but by 1721 he was in Brescia, and his earliest work (1724) is a signed portrait of a Brescian patrician: his portraits are influenced by his elder contemporary Ghislandi. He frescoed the staircase of the Palazzo Grassi in Venice c. 1470 and was back in Milan by 1757. His present fame is based on his groups of working-class sitters, ranging from lacemakers to destitute vagabonds, painted in a technique similar to Ghislandi's, but the subject-matter is far closer to the Le Nain brothers, and ultimately derived from Caravaggio's realism. His nickname in Italy is Pitocchetto, the Little Miser. None of his works is dated, and few are yet in museums.



"
1005,"CERVELLI, Federico","(b. ca. 1638, Milano, d. 1700, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cervelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Though born in Milan, Cervelli worked predominantly in Venice where he ran a successful studio where Sebastiano Ricci first trained. He initially trained with Pietro Ricchi (Il Lucchese). From the time of Cervelli's arrival, he was in direct contact with Pietro Liberi, whose influence is evident in his early work. By the late 1670s, however, the artist had relinquished Liberi's pseudo-classical style in favour of the more theatrical manner adopted by his contemporaries."
1006,CESARE da Sesto,"(b. 1477, Sesto Calende, d. 1523, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cesare/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was one of the most significant artists to emerge from Leonardo's circle in Milan, and his travels south of Rome helped to spread the ideas of the High Renaissance to painters in Naples and Sicily. As early as 1506 Cesare may have been in Rome, where he entered into a long working relationship with Baldassare Peruzzi. This probably began in S Onofrio, where a lunette depicting a strongly Leonardesque Virgin and Child with a Donor may be by him. By June 1508 Cesare was painting alongside Peruzzi in the Vatican Stanze of Julius II, specifically in the Pope's bedroom. Cesare possibly contributed to the 11 frescoes (Rome, Pinacoteca Vaticana) that are thought to correspond to an uccelliera (aviary) painted by Peruzzi and described by Vasari. Peruzzi's team next worked in Ostia on the decoration of the Episcopio, the palace of Cardinal Raffaele Riario after his election as Bishop of Ostia in February 1511. Vasari described these frescoes as battle scenes all'antica and attributed them in part to Cesare. Cesare's introduction to Naples may have come around this time through Cardinal Oliviero Carafa. They attributed to Cesare a votive painting of Christ and a Donor (Naples, Capodimonte), in which the kneeling donor closely resembles other known representations of the Cardinal. After six years in southern Italy, Cesare returned to Milan, where he had a workshop and received commissions until his death.

"
1007,"CESARI, Giuseppe","(b. 1568, Rome, d. 1640, Rome)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cesari/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist painter, also known as Cavaliere d'Arpino, active mainly in Rome. He had an enormous reputation in the first two decades of the 17th century, when he gained some of the most prestigious commissions of the day, most notably the designing of the mosaics for the dome of St Peter's (1603-12). Although some of his early work is vigorous and colourful, his output is generally repetious and vacuous, untouched by the innovations of Caravaggio (who was briefly his assistant) or the Carracci. He was primarily a fresco painter, but he also did numerous cabinet pictures of religious or mythological scenes in a finicky Flemish manner.

1009,"CÉZANNE, Paul","(b. 1839, Aix-en-Provence, d. 1906, Aix-en-Provence)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cezanne/biograph.html,"
French painter, the leading figure in the revolution toward abstraction in modern painting. His father, Philippe Auguste, was the cofounder of a banking firm which prospered throughout the artist's life, affording him financial security that was unavailable to most of his contemporaries and eventually resulting in a large inheritance. In 1852 Cézanne entered the Collège Bourbon, where he met and became friends with Émile Zola who for a time encouraged the painter in his work. Cézanne began to study painting and drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts in Aix in 1856. His father opposed the pursuit of an artistic career, and in 1858 he persuaded Cézanne to enter law school at the University of Aix. Although Cézanne continued his law studies for several years, he was simultaneously enrolled in the School of Design in Aix, where he remained until 1861."
1010,"CHALGRIN, Jean-François-Thérese","(b. 1739, Paris, d. 1811, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chalgrin/biograph.html,"
French architect. He studied architecture with Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni (1695-1766), Étienne Louis Boullée and Pierre Louis Moreau-Desproux (1727 or 1736-1793). He took the Academy of Architecture's Grand Prix de Rome in 1758 at age 19, traveled to Rome the following year, and returned to France in 1763. His patrons included the Count de Saint-Florentin, for whose mistress Chalgrin built a house on the Champs-Élysées that was subsequently leased by Thomas Jefferson during the years that he served as U.S. minister to the French government."
1011,"CHAMBERLIN, Mason the Elder","(b. 1727, London, d. 1787, Dorset)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chamberl/biograph.html,"
English painter. He began work as a clerk in a counting-house in the City of London. He studied art under Francis Hayman and began painting portraits after his style, such as a Lady and a Gentleman (1761; Yale Center for British Art, New Haven) and a Naval Officer and his Son (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich). Although Chamberlin lived in Spitalfields, outside the circle of West End artists, he secured a reasonable amount of patronage from the middle class and one commission from the royal family, Prince Edward and Princess Augusta (untraced). He also painted portraits of scientific and medical men such as Benjamin Franklin (private collection), Dr Chandler (Royal Society, London) and William Hunter (c. 1781; Royal Academy, London). He exhibited portraits and history paintings at the Society of Artists (1760-68), from which he received a premium for a history painting in 1764. He also exhibited at the Free Society in 1764 and was a founder-member of the Royal Academy, exhibiting there between 1769 and 1786."
1012,"CHAMBERS, William","(b. 1723, Göteborg, d. 1796, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chambers/biograph.html,"
English architect of Scottish descent, but born in Sweden. He was an eclectic architect of the Georgian period who was one of the leading Palladian-style architects of his day. In the 1760s and 1770s he was the most influential British architect."
1013,"CHAMPAIGNE, Jean-Baptiste de","(b. 1631, Bruxelles, d. 1681, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/champaig/jeanbapt/biograph.html,"
French painter of Flemish origin, nephew of Philippe de Champaigne. His uncle sent for him, following the death of his own son, to be his pupil and assistant. The earliest paintings attributed to Jean-Baptiste, such as a double portrait (1645; Rotterdam, Boymans-van Beuningen) that he executed in collaboration with Nicolas de Platte Montagne, show that he had been an apt student. In 1658 his uncle reluctantly allowed him to make an 18-month stay in Italy; while there, he was deeply impressed by the paintings of Raphael and Titian."
1014,"CHAMPAIGNE, Philippe de","(b. 1602, Bruxelles, d. 1674, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/champaig/philippe/biograph.html,"
Apart from Vouet, Champaigne was the most important painter active in Paris in the middle years of the 17th century. He was born and trained in Brussels. He arrived in Paris in 1621. Throughout his career he made many official commissions, for monasteries, for the Church, and for Louis XIII.  He collaborated with Nicolas Poussin in decorating the Luxembourg Palace, then worked for the queen mother, Marie de Medicis, for Louis XIII, and after 1635 primarily for the king's chief minister, Cardinal Armand Richelieu, for whom he decorated the Palais Royal, the dome of the Sorbonne, and other buildings."
1015,"CHANDLER, John Westbrooke","(b. 1764, Edinburgh, d. ca. 1804, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chandler/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, natural son of George, 2nd Earl of Warwick (1746-1816). He was a poet and a portrait painter. He wrote a ballad and worked in London and Aberdeen before moving to Edinburgh, where he became mentally ill and died in an institution.



"
1016,"CHANGENET, Jean",(active 1486-1493 in Provence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/changene/biograph.html,"
Jean Changenet (le Bourguignon), French painter. He came from the diocese of Langres and may have been born in Dijon; he was perhaps a member of the family of painters named Changenet who were active there from the mid-15th century. Jean Changenet is documented in Avignon from 1485, and it is clear from the variety and importance of his commissions and the number of his apprentices that he was the most prominent painter there at the end of the 15th century. In 1503 his daughter Michelle married the painter Josse Lieferinxe.


"
1017,"CHANTREY, Sir Francis Legatt","(b. 1781, Norton, d. 1841, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chantrey/biograph.html,"
English sculptor. The son of a carpenter, he was apprenticed to a wood carver in Sheffield but left to come to London, c. 1802, to study at the Royal Academy Schools. Until about 1804 his work included painted portraits, but after that date he confined himself to sculpture. His portrait bust of the Revd J. Horne-Took, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811 (Fitzwilliam, Cambridge), brought him fame, and he succeeded Nollekens as the most successful sculptor of portrait busts in England."
1018,"CHAPU, Henri","(b. 1833, Le Mée-sur-Seine, d. 1891, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chapu/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. His father, a coachman, sent him to the Petite École (École Gratuite de Dessin), Paris, to have him trained as a tapestry-maker. In 1849 his successes led him to the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he became a pupil of James Pradier, François Duret and Léon Cogniet. In 1855 he won the Prix de Rome for sculpture with the relief Cleobis and Biton (plaster, untraced; sketch model, Le Mée-sur-Seine, Musée Henri Chapu); he completed his education at the Académie de France in Rome, remaining there until 1861. During this time he lived as a virtual recluse, his only friend being the painter Léon Bonnat."
1019,"CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon","(b. 1699, Paris, d. 1779, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chardin/biograph.html,"
French painter of still lifes and domestic scenes remarkable for their intimate realism and tranquil atmosphere and the luminous quality of their paint. For his still lifes he chose humble objects (Le Buffet, 1728), and for his genre paintings modest events (Dame cachetant une lettre [1733; Lady Sealing a Letter]). He also executed some fine portraits, especially the pastels of his last years. He was nominated to the Royal Academy of Painting in 1728."
1020,"CHARLES, James","(b. 1851, Warrington, d. 1906, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charles/biograph.html,"
English painter. He had his initial training at Hatherly's School of Art in London. In 1882 he began his studies at the Royal Academy in London and the Académie Julian in Paris. He was an exponent of plein-air painting, he painted atmospheric, naturalistic landscape and genre pictures. He worked mainly at his country estate of east Ashling House near Chichester. He had several stays on Capri."
1021,"CHARLET, Nicolas-Toussaint","(b. 1792, Paris, d. 1845, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charlet/biograph.html,"
French designer and painter. He served in the National Guard 1814, but lost his employment as a town-hall clerk 1816 owing to political changes. He then studied art under Antoine Gros. Charlet was a friend of the Romantic painter Théodore Géricault, whom he accompanied to London and interested in lithography."
1022,"CHARONTON, Enguerrand","(b. ca. 1410, Laon, d. ca. 1466, Avignon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charonto/biograph.html,"
Enguerrand Charonton (or Quarton), French painter. His career is unusually well documented for a provincial artist of his date (he was active in Aix, Arles, and Avignon), but there are only two extant works that are certainly by him. These are the Virgin of Mercy (1452) in the Musée Condé at Chantilly, painted in collaboration with an obscure artist called Pierre Villatte, and the Coronation of the Virgin (1454) in the Musée de l'Hospice at Villeneuve-les-Avignon. They are both highly impressive works, uniting Flemish and Italian influence and having something of the monumental character of the sculpture of Charonton's region. Indeed, they show Charonton to have been a painter of such commanding stature that there is an increasing tendency to attribute to him the celebrated Avignon Pietà (Louvre, Paris), the greatest French painting of the period.



"
1023,"CHARPENTIER, Alexandre-Louis-Marie","(b. 1856, Paris, d. 1909, Neuilly)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charpen/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, medallist and designer. After studying with the medal engraver Hubert Ponscarmé (1827-1903), he first exhibited at the Salon of 1879. His first work, at the age of 21, was a tiny medal featuring a portrait of his mother. His first significant work, exhibited in 1883, was a bas-relief, Young Woman Suckling her Child; the final version of this, in marble, was later ordered by the State (Aix-en-Provence, Musée Granet). Then, from 1893, incorporating this relief into a nursery cabinet, he started decorative works, a direction it seems he had been keen to follow."
1024,"CHARPENTIER, Félix-Maurice","(b. 1858, Bollène, d. 1924, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charpenf/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. At the age of seven he already carved wooden figures and formed clay sculptures. At the age of 16, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Avignon, where he learned the crafts of statue. In 1877 he moved to Paris and attended the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He became a pupil of Pierre-Jules Cavelier (1814-1894) and Amédée Doublemard (1826-1900), with whom he was in friendly relationship. "
1025,"CHARPENTIER, Jean-Baptiste the Elder","(b. 1728, Paris, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charpenj/biograph.html,"
French painter. Little is known about this artist. He was born in Paris into a family originally from Normandy. He became member and professor of the Academy of St. Luke in 1760. He exhibited at the Academy from 1762 to 1774 and at the Salon de la Correspondance in 1780 and 1785."
1026,"CHARPENTIER, Constance","(b. 1767, Paris, d. 1849, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/charpent/biograph.html,"
French woman painter. She was a pupil of François Gérard and Jacques-Louis David, and in 1788 she received a Prix d'Encouragement. She exhibited at the Salon from 1795 until 1819, when she received a gold medal. Like other female painters of her period, she specialized in sentimental genre scenes and portraits of women and children. Although she was considered by contemporary critics to be one of the finest portrait painters of the age, few works by her have been traced. One of the first known works is Scene of Family Life (1796, private collection), a genre scene closer to Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun than to David. Among her portraits shown in the Salon of 1801 may have been that of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art), previously attributed to David, showing a young girl drawing, posed against the sunlight. The painting reflects the influence of Gérard and is close in style to a portrait of Mme Pagniere-Drolling (St Louis, Art Museum).

1028,"CHASSÉRIAU, Théodore","(b. 1819, Sainte-Barbe de Samana, d. 1856, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chasseri/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. In 1822 Chassériau moved with his family to Paris, where he received a bourgeois upbringing under the supervision of an older brother. A precociously gifted draughtsman, he entered Ingres's studio at the age of 11 and remained there until Ingres left to head the Académie de France in Rome in 1834. He made his Salon début in 1836 with several portraits and religious subjects, including Cain Accursed (Paris, private collection), for which he received a third-class medal. Among his many submissions in subsequent years were Susanna Bathing (1839, exhibited Salon 1839; Paris, Louvre), a Marine Venus (1838; exhibited Salon 1839; Paris, Louvre) and the Toilet of Esther (1841, exhibited Salon 1842; Paris, Louvre); these three paintings of nude female figures combine an idealization derived from Ingres with a sensuality characteristic of Chassériau."
1029,"CHASTILLON, Claude","(b. ca. 1560, Châlons-sur-Marne, d. 1616, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chastill/biograph.html,"
French topographical draughtsman and engineer. He was born into the provincial gentry in Châlons-sur-Marne. Although the title that he assumed, Topographe du Roi, does not correspond to any known post of this period, that of Ingénieur du Roi did exist and designated a member of a corps created in the early 16th century that specialized in fortification, the art of besiegement and hydraulics."
1030,"CHÂTELET, Claude-Louis","(b. 1753, Paris, d. 1794, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chatelet/biograph.html,"
French painter. Little is known about his artistic training, Alongside vedutas of his homeland of France, he also painted Swiss and Italian landscapes after his visits. He was especially famed for his watercolours, which were often used as designs for prints and book illustrations."
1031,"CHATROUSSE, Émile","(b. 1829, Paris, d. 1896, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chatrous/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and writer. Born in humble circumstances, he was apprenticed to a jeweler at the age of 11. He subsequently trained with the painter Abel de Pujol (1785-1861) but seems to have taught himself the techniques of sculpture, and at the 1848 Salon he exhibited a plaster sketch of Khair-ed-Din, called Barbarossa (untraced). In 1851, on the advice of his patron, the Comte de Nieuwekerke, he became François Rude's last pupil. In 1853 he exhibited a plaster group of Queen Hortense and her Son Louis Napoleon (untraced), which brought him a commission from Louis Napoleon, by then Napoleon III, for a marble of the same group (Compiegne, Château); this was exhibited in 1855 at the Exposition Universelle, Paris."
1032,"CHAUDET, Denis-Antoine","(b. 1763, Paris, d. 1810, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chaudet/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, painter, draughtsman and designer. He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Stouf and Etienne-Pierre-Adrien Gois. In 1784 he won the Prix de Rome with the bas-relief Joseph Sold into Slavery by his Brothers (Paris, Louvre), which is in a style very different from that of his mature statues and reliefs. He spent the next four years as a pupil at the Académie de France in Rome, where he was much influenced by the sculpture of antiquity and by the Neo-classical work of Antonio Canova. He was approved (agréé) as an associate of the Académie Royale in 1789, and though he never became a full member he exhibited regularly at the Salon throughout his career."
1033,"CHAUVEAU, François","(b. 1613, Paris, d. 1676, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chauveau/biograph.html,"
Etcher, draughtsman and painter, part of a French family of artists. The sons of the etcher François Chauveau (1613-1676) included three painters, Louis Chauveau (c. 1656-after 1695), Charles Chauveau (b 1658/9; fl c. 1683) and Evrard Chauveau (1660-1793) and also one sculptor, René Chauveau (1663-1722)."
1034,"CHAUVIN, Pierre-Athanase","(b. 1774, Paris, 1832, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chauvin/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a pupil of Pierre Henri de Valenciennes in Paris; although a painter of classical landscapes, he did not inherit his master's aspirations to history painting. Chauvin's major debt to Valenciennes is his mastery of light and atmospheric recession. His first known work, the Banks of the Anio, near Rome (1807; Boulogne-Billancourt, Bibliothèque Marmottan), executed three years after he settled permanently in Rome, indicates that he did learn from direct observation of nature. The picture also displays Chauvin's picturesque form of Neo-classicism which proved to be extremely popular."
1035,"CHEERE, Sir Henry","(b. 1703, London, d. 1781, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cheere/henry/biograph.html,"
English sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. He was apprenticed in 1718 to the mason Robert Harsthorne (active 1715-1528), and by 1726 he had established his own sculptor's yard near St Margaret's, Westminster, London. He worked initially with Henry Scheemakers (d. 1748) on the vast monument to the 1st Duke of Ancaster (c. 1728; Edenham, Lincs), in which the life-size figure of the Duke clad in Roman armour is set against a marble niche flanked by Corinthian columns."

English sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, brother of Sir Henry Cheere. He was the more famous of the two in his day, and his contribution to English sculpture was arguably more significant. He was apprenticed to a haberdasher in 1725 for seven years."
1037,"CHEMIN, Joseph Victor","(b. 1825, Paris, d. 1901, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chemin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was one of Antoine-Louis Barye's successful students. He first exhibited at the Salon of 1851, which also was the year his teacher, Barye, returned to the Salon. Chemin exhibited regularly at the Salon from 1857 until 1894."

1040,"CHIARI, Giuseppe Bartolomeo","(b. 1654, Roma, d. 1727, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chiari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the most faithful pupil of Carlo Maratti, keeping his art alive into the 1720s with a softer, more elegant version of his classicism. This in its turn influenced the style of Agostino Masucci (1690-1768), Maratti's last significant pupil. According to Pascoli, Chiari was apprenticed to the painter and art dealer Carlantonio Galliani at the age of ten before he joined Maratti's studio in Rome, in 1666. His first official commission was for paintings on the side walls of the chapel of the Marcaccioni in Santa Maria del Suffragio, Rome (Birth of the Virgin; Adoration of the Magi), entrusted to him on the death of Niccolò Berrettoni (1637-1682), who had originally been asked to do them. This project established his reputation, and thereafter he won the patronage of many noble Roman families and of foreign visitors to Rome."

"
1042,"CHILONE, Vincenzo","(b. 1758, Venezia, d. 1839, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chilone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil of Canaletto, active in Venice. The Neo-classical movement in Venice included a number of artists of note, who often painted the cultivated and refined  decorations for buildings erected or renovated in the period. Among the artists who continued to draw inspiration from the great Venetian Vedutisti were Vincenzo Chilone and Ippolito Caffi. Chilone's paintings were rather dry and superficial, and they failed to achieve the union between figures and architectural setting that had seemed so spontaneous in the eighteenth century.



"
1043,"CHINARD, Joseph","(b. 1756, Lyon, d. 1813, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/chinard/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the son of a silk merchant and trained under the painter Donat Nonotte at the Ecole Royale de Dessin in Lyon. He then worked with the local sculptor Barthélemy Blaise (1738-1819). In 1772 he assisted Blaise with the restoration of the sculptures on the façade of the Hôtel de Ville. By 1780 he was working independently and received a commission from the canons of St Paul for chalk statues of St Paul, St Sacerdos and the Four Evangelists (all destroyed 1793-94). He subsequently made stone statues of St Bruno and St John the Baptist (partially destroyed) for the Charterhouse at Selignac, near Bourg-en-Bresse."

Polish/German painter and engraver, son of a Polish grain merchant and a French Huguenot emigrant. He spent his entire adult life in Berlin, where he learnt first to become merchant, then studied art in Bernhard Rode's workshop.

1046,"CHRISTIAN, Johann Josef","(b. 1706, Riedlingen, d. 1777, Riedlingen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/christia/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and woodcarver. He studied under the sculptor Johann Eucharius Hermann (d. 1727) in Biberach an der Riss, but it is possible that he may have been more strongly influenced by the sculptor and stuccoist Diego Carlone, then working at Weingarten Abbey. His rare double gift as a woodworker and stucco sculptor was equalled only by Joseph Anton Feuchtmayr. His masterworks are considered to be the choir stalls in Zwiefalten Abbey and Ottobeuren Abbey."
1047,"CHRISTUS, Petrus","(b. 1410/20, Baarle, d. 1475/76, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/christus/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. He is first documented at Bruges in 1444, and he is thought by some authorities to have been the pupil of Jan van Eyck and to have completed some of the works left unfinished by the master at his death in 1444 (e.g. St Jerome, Detroit Institute of Arts). However, this may not be true since probably he arrived to Bruges only after the death of van Eyck. It is certainly true that he was overwhelmingly influenced by van Eyck, and his copies and variations of his work helped to spread the Eyckian style. Christus's work is more summary than van Eyck's, however, his figures sometimes rather doll-like and without van Eyck's feeling of inner life. The influence of Rogier van der Weyden is also evident in Christus's work; the Lamentation (Musees Royaux, Brussels) is clearly based on van der Weyden's great Prado Deposition, but the figures have completely lost their dramatic impact. "
1048,"CHURCH, Frederic Edwin","(b. 1826, Hartford, d. 1900, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/church/biograph.html,"
American landscape painter. He was a pupil and close friend of Cole and continued the preoccupations of the Hudson River School with the most spectacular aspects of natural scenery. Church looked and travelled beyond his native country, however, painting not only the Niagara Falls, for example, but also the tropical forests of South America, icebergs, and exploding volcanoes, often on a huge scale. He was immensely popular in his day, and after a period of neglect is returing to favour again. His house, Olana, on the Hudson River, is now a museum.

Spanish architect, member of a family of architects and sculptors prominent during the last years of the 17th century and the first quarter of the 18th. The chief members of the family were three brothers, sons of a Barcelona altarpiece maker, all active at the same time. Often they and their four sons worked together on projects. The family has become identified with the Spanish late-Baroque style. The term Churrigueresque denotes a style that is visually frenetic and exuberantly detailed."
1051,"CIAMPANTI, Michele",(active 1470-1510 in Lucca),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ciampant/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is first documented in Lucca in 1470. In 1485 he was commissioned by Nicolao da Noceto to paint the vault of the chapel of S Regolo in Lucca Cathedral and to gild an altar carved by Matteo Civitale, also for the cathedral. In 1481 Ciampanti and Civitale had executed a polyptych for the church of S Romano, Lucca, and in 1486 Ciampanti, with Vincenzo Frediani, assessed Civitale's wooden Pietà (Lucca, Villa Guinigi). In 1492 Ciampanti was in Lucca, and in 1496 he was in Pietrasanta painting in the cathedral. He was in Lucca again from 1506 to 1510."
1052,"CIAMPELLI, Agostino","(b. 1565, Firenze, d. 1630, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ciampell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Santi di Tito, whom he followed in the creation of a new naturalist style that satisfied the demands of the Counter-Reformation church for a direct and simple religious art. The clarity of his early Calling of St Andrew (Pescia Cathedral) and the modest domestic interior in the Birth of the Virgin (1593; Florence, San Michelino Visdomini) are indebted to Santi."
1053,"CIARDI, Guglielmo","(b. 1842, Venezia, d. 1917, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ciardi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was trained under landscape artist Bresolin at the Accademia in Venice. On trips to France he came to know the Barbizon school. In 1868, he encountered the Macchiaioli in Florence and was influenced by Signorini.  A trip to Rome and Naples introduced him to Nino Costa and the work of Palizzi, Morelli, and Gigante, the combination of Romantic painting and Realism influenced him considerably."
1054,"CIGNANI, Carlo","(b. 1628, Bologna, d. 1719, Forli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cignani/biograph.html,"

Italian painter and draughtsman. He was a pupil of Albani, but his style is closer to that of Guido Reni and he became the main force in upholding the tradition of Bolognese classicism into the 18th century."
1055,"CIGNAROLI, Giambettino","(b. 1706, Verona, d. 1770, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cignarol/giambett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the leading painter in 18th-century Verona. His works have mainly religious themes and he is especially known for his paintings of the Virgin and Child. The works are overwhelmingly spiritual, but frequently include lively incidents, such as playing cherubs, and they possess a tranquil quality, perhaps a reflection of the artist's personality. Giambettino was the only child of Leonardo Cignaroli and Rosa Lugiati, but through his father's second marriage, to Maddelena Vicentini, he had six half-siblings, among whom were the painters Gian Domenico (1724-93) and Giuseppe (Fra Felice) Cignaroli (1727-96) and the sculptor Diomiro (1717-1803), whose oldest son, Gaetano (1747-1826), was also a sculptor. A Piedmontese branch of the family produced several landscape painters. Giambettino's early education was in the humanities; he was particularly adept at rhetoric and developed a lifelong interest in Latin literature and in Greek and Roman antiquity.

1056,"CIGNAROLI, Scipione","(b. 1690, Milano, d. 1753, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cignarol/scipione/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists, son of the painter Martino Cignaroli (1649-1726). He was active alongside his father who lived in Turin from 1718. He studied with Pieter Mulier the Younger in Milan, and he studied the works of Dughet, Poussin and Salvator Rosa in Rome. "
1057,CIGOLI,"(b. 1559, Villa Castelvecchi di Cigoli, d. 1613, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cigoli/biograph.html,"
Cigoli (Lodovico Cardi), Florentine painter, architect, and poet. He was the outstanding Florentine painter of his generation and his work represents the complex stylistic cross-currents in the period of transition from Mannerism to Baroque. A key figure in the development of Baroque in Florence, Cigoli also played an important role in seventeenth-century Rome."
1058,CIMA da Conegliano,"(b. ca. 1459, Conegliano, d. 1517/18, Conegliano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cima/biograph.html,"

1059,CIMABUE,"(b. ca. 1240, Firenze, d. ca. 1302, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cimabue/biograph.html,"Florentine painter. His nickname means 'Ox-head'. He was a contemporary of Dante, who refers to him in The Divine Comedy (Purg. xi. 94-6) as an artist who was 'believed to hold the field in painting' only to be eclipsed by Giotto's fame. Ironically enough this passage, meant to illustrate the vanity of short-lived earthly glory, has become the basis for Cimabue's fame; for, embroidering on this reference, later writers made him into the discoverer and teacher of Giotto and regarded him as the first in the long line of great Italian painters. He was said to have worked in the 'Greek' (i.e.  Byzantine) manner, but to have begun the movement towards greater realism which culminated in the Renaissance.

"
1060,"CIMAROLI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1687, Salò, d. 1771, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cimaroli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was one of the most admired North Italian landscape painters of his day. According to his contemporary, Pietro Guarienti, Cimaroli, who settled in Venice in 1713, had studied in Brescia under Antonio Aureggio and Antonio Calza (1653-1725), and enjoyed the patronage of collectors in England and elsewhere. That Cimaroli was an artist much in demand is illustrated by his collaboration in 1726 with Canaletto, Piazzetta, Pittoni and other artists on series of Allegorical tombs of British worthies commissioned by the 2nd Duke of Richmond. He provided the landscape elements of this commission."

He attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna from 1742 until he graduated in 1753. Cimbal became friends with the painter Felix Ivo Leicher and the sculptor Raymond Siess, whom he may have met in Vienna. Siess sponsored some of Cimbal's children at their baptisms."

Italian painter, active in Spain. Little is known of his life. He was a pupil of Salviati in his native Florence, and he worked in a pompous Mannerist style. His production in Spain is limited, he was chosen by Philip II to replace in the Escorial the Martyrdom of St Maurice painted by El Greco. This commission indicates that he was highly valued among the court painters by Philip II.



"
1063,"CINGANELLI, Michelangelo","(b. ca. 1558, Settignano, d. 1635, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cinganel/biograph.html,"

Along with Orazio Riminaldi, he painted the four Evangelists and angels (1597) in the cupola of the Cathedral of Pisa; a Birth of the Virgin and Annunciation (1598) in the choir; and decoration of the organ in 1602. He also painted in the church of San Domenico, Pistoia."
1064,"CIOLI, Valerio","(b. ca. 1529, Settignano, d. 1599, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cioli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, son of sculptor Simone Cioli (Simone da Settignano). After training with his father, he worked under Niccolò Tribolo at Cosimo I de' Medici's villa at Castello from c. 1544, when he may have produced the spirited bronze fountain figure Satyr with a Flask (Florence, Bargello), which was formerly at Castello. In 1548-49 he went to Rome, where he entered the workshop of Raffaello da Montelupo, a pupil of Michelangelo. No autograph work survives from this period, but his activity as a restorer of antique statues between 1554 and 1560 is well documented: he worked first for Giuliano Cesarini and then, together with his father, for Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este. The restoration of a colossal statue of Rome (Rome, Villa Medici), formerly at the Este villa of Monte Cavallo, has been attributed to Valerio. During this period he may also have restored and recarved the antique figure of Narcissus (London, Victoria and Albert Museum), which was attributed to Michelangelo during the 19th century."

Austrian painter, called Il Todeschini, active in Lombardy in the first half of the 18th century. He was a prolific painter of Caravaggesque genre scenes, influenced by Antonio Cifrondi, and by the Danish painter Bernhard Keil (Monsù Bernardo), who was active in Lombardy in the mid-seventeenth century. He lived in Brescia during the same period as Ceruti, under whose influence his style changed, and he became an important representative of the naturalist movement appearing in Italy in the first decades of the 18th century.

Niccolò Circignani (also Niccolò Pomarancio), Italian painter. He may have been a pupil of Daniele da Volterra and later of Santi di Tito. In 1564 he was in Rome working on frescoes of Old Testament narratives in the Sala Grande of the Vatican Belvedere. Next, in Perugia, he formed a partnership with Hendrick van den Broeck and in 1565 replaced him in the painting of frescoes (destroyed) for Orvieto Cathedral. His paintings of this period - including the frescoes (1568) in the church of the Maestà delle Volte, Perugia, the Resurrection (1569; Mongiovino, Sanctuary) and the Annunciation (1577; Città di Castello, Pinacoteca Comunale) - are strongly influenced by late Florentine and Roman Mannerism."

1069,"CIUFFAGNI, Bernardo","(b. 1385, Firenze, d. 1457, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/ciuffagn/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His name first appears on the rolls of Florence Cathedral in 1409. The following year he was commissioned to provide the seated figure of St Matthew (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence) for the main portal of the cathedral, the other three evangelists having already been assigned to Nanni di Banco, Niccolò di Piero Lamberti and Donatello. Completed in 1415, the St Matthew displays Ciuffagni's talent for eclecticism rather than originality, and records testify to a degree of suspicion on behalf of the other three sculptors at the newcomer's interest in their work. Ciuffagni continued to enjoy official favour in Florence, and widely attributed works include a prophet for the Porta della Mandorla (c. 1415), a statue of Joshua for the campanile façade (begun c. 1415-17, finished, probably by another artist, 1421; Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence) and a statue of St Peter for the Butchers' Guild at Orsanmichele (c. 1415; in situ)."
1070,"CIVITALE, Matteo","(b. 1436, Lucca, d. 1501, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/civitale/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, painter, architect and engineer. He is generally considered the most important Tuscan marble sculptor working outside Florence during the second half of the 15th century; he is also documented as a painter, although no works have been attributed to him. Civitali's training and early years are undocumented, but it is likely that he worked in Antonio Rossellino's Florentine workshop during the 1460s. He is first mentioned in 1468, when he appraised Rossellino's tomb of Filippo Lazzari in Pistoia Cathedral."
1071,"CLAEISSENS, Antoon","(b. ca. 1538, Brugge, d. 1613, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/claeisse/antoon/biograph.html,"
Antoon (Anthuenis) Claeissens (Claeis; Claeiss; Claeissins), part of a Flemish family  of painters. Pieter Claeissens the Elder (1499-1576) and his three sons Gillis Claeissens (before 1536-1605), Pieter Claeissens [Claeissz.] the Younger (1536-1623) and Antoon] Claeissens were all active in Bruges, but little of their life and work has been documented. Pieter Claeissens the Elder was a pupil of Adrian Becaert in 1516; in 1530 he became a master in the Bruges Guild of St Luke, where he later held various official posts. He was also enrolled (1544) as an illuminator in the craft guild. In 1572 he was commissioned to paint a Resurrection for Bruges Cathedral (in situ). He also executed a number of portraits."
1072,"CLAEISSENS, Pieter the Younger","(b. ca. 1540, Brugge, d. 1623, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/claeisse/pieter_y/biograph.html,"
The Claeissens family monopolized official painting in Bruges with their enormous output in the late 16th century. The most important members of the family are Pieter the Elder (1499/1500-1576), Pieter the Younger (c. 1540-1623) and his brother Antoon (c. 1538-1613). Both sons were city painters at one time or another. All three painted in the same, rather wooden and stereotyped manner. They continued the local tradition that derived from the style of Benson and Isenbrant but their paintings were executed in a more modern way; more adapted to Pourbus. Few works can be attributed with any certainty to the father of the clan. In addition to paintings with patron saints and donors' portraits, the Groeninge Museum in Bruges owns several interesting historical and political allegories painted by the Claeissens sons. The genre proved extremely popular from the sixteenth century onwards, as it allowed rulers to imbue important political occasions with a mythical aura.



"
1073,"CLAESZ., Anthony II","(b. ca. 1607, Amsterdam, d. 1649, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/claes_a/biograph.html,"

Dutch still-life painter, born in Germany and active in Haarlem where he settled in 1617. He and Willem Claeasz. Heda, who also worked in Haarlem, were the most important exponents of the ""ontbijt"" or breakfast piece. They painted with subdued, virtually monochromatic palettes, the subtle handling of light and texture being the prime means of expression. Claesz. generally chose objects of a more homely kind than Heda, although his later work became more colourful and decorative. The two men founded a distinguished tradition of still-life painting in Haarlem, but Claesz.'s son, Nicholas Berchem became famous as a landscape painter.

Dutch painter. He was a still-life painter who worked in Dordrecht (1642-46), The Hague (1646-51), Leiden (1651-66), Zeeland (1666). From Zeeland he returned to Leiden where he was last mentioned in 1694. A dated vanitas still-life with a signature and inscription suggests that the painter around 1687 resided in Haarlem. He was a member of the Guild of St Luke in Dordrecht, The Hague and Leiden."
1078,CLAUDE LORRAIN,"(b. 1600, Chamagne, d. 1682, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/claude/biograph.html,"
Claude Lorrain, byname of Claude Gellée, French artist best known for, and one of the greatest masters of, ideal-landscape painting, an art form that seeks to present a view of nature more beautiful and harmonious than nature itself. The quality of that beauty is governed by classical concepts, and the landscape often contains classical ruins and pastoral figures in classical dress. The source of inspiration is the countryside around Rome - the Roman Campagna - a countryside haunted with remains and associations of antiquity. The practitioners of ideal landscape during the 17th century, the key period of its development, were artists of many nationalities congregated in Rome. Later, the form spread to other countries. Claude, whose special contribution was the poetic rendering of light, was particularly influential, not only during his lifetime but, especially in England, from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century.

French sculptor, the elder sister of writer Paul Claudel. Her early interest in sculpture with symbolic meanings was fostered by artist Alfred Boucher. In 1881, she moved from Nogent-sur-Seine to Paris, and it was most probably in 1882 that she met and became a student of sculptor Auguste Rodin. Their relationship, which evolved into a tempestuous affair lasting until 1898, was initially one of artistic encouragement and development, but later it proved to undermine her artistic identity and contribute to her intense persecution mania for which she was later hospitalised. She adopted the master's craggy modeling style and themes of desire, secrecy, and decay as found in Rodin's The Gates of Hell. As a draftsman, she executed many portrait heads in a Social Realist style. By 1914 she was interned to a home in Montdevergues where she remained until her death in 1943.

Belgian painter, pastelist, and draftsman. He had various menial jobs before the composer Peter Benoit persuaded his father to let him study at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp. He was taught there by Nicaise de Keyser (1813-1887) and Jacob Jacobs (1812-79) but found the atmosphere uncongenial and soon left. In 1879 he travelled around Spain and North Africa and in 1881 went to live with his sister at Waereghem. His painting of this period was influenced by Charles Verlat and depicted rural subjects, such as Cock Fight in Flanders (1882, private collection). This painting was a sensation when exhibited for the first time, in Antwerp and it won him a gold medal at the Paris Salon."

Claus (Claux) de Werve, Netherlandish sculptor, active in France. He was the nephew and follower of Claus Sluter. From his arrival in Dijon in December 1396 he was principal assistant to his uncle on the monumental Calvary group, the Moses Well, commissioned by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, for the cloister of the Charterhouse in Champmol near Dijon. After Sluter's death in 1406, de Werve was named 'tailleur d'ymages et varlet de chambre' to Duke John the Fearless, a position renewed under Philip the Good. Between 1406 and 1410 he completed the marble and alabaster tomb of Philip the Bold (Musée Archéologique, Dijon) begun by Jean de Marville and Sluter. De Werve travelled to Savoy in 1408 at the request of Duke Amadeus VIII, possibly to work on the Sainte-Chapelle at Chambéry."
1082,"CLAUSEN, George","(b. 1852, London, d. 1944, Newbury)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/clausen/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was the son of a Danish interior decorator and a woman of Scottish descent. At 14 he was apprenticed to the drawing office of Messrs Trollope, a London firm of decorators. While working there he attended evening classes at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, but his first important artistic contact came when he was sent to decorate a door at the home of the painter Edwin Long (1829-1891). With Long's encouragement, Clausen obtained a two-year scholarship to the South Kensington School of Art and then decided to further his training at the Antwerp Academy. After studying briefly under Professor Joseph Van Lerius (1823-1876), he began to sketch in the fishing villages along the Dutch coast; the product of these studies, High Mass at a Fishing Village on the Zuyder Zee (1876; Nottingham, Castle Museum), was his first Royal Academy exhibit and was well received."
1083,"CLERCK, Hendrik de","(b. ca. 1570, Bruxelles, d. 1630, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/clerck/biograph.html,"
Clerck was a Flemish painter. He spent the greater part of his successful career in Brussels. He was the pupil of Marten de Vos and carried the Mannerist tradition far into the 17th century. In 1606 he was appointed Court Painter to Archduke Albert. He was primarily a painter of altarpieces and a characteristic example of his style is the Family of the Virgin (Musées Royaux, Brussels. 1590), with its Italianate figures clad in restless draperies and placed in a coldly classical building.

French architect, painter, and archaeologist. He was a notable if controversial figure associated with the development of the Neo-classical style of architecture and interior design and its dissemination throughout Europe and the United States. He trained as an architect in Paris under Germain Boffrand (1667-1754). He was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1746 and was ""pensionnaire du Roi"" at the French Academy in Rome from 1749 to 1754."

In 1847 he married one of George Sand's daughters and was a friend of figures like Delacroix and Chopin."
1086,"CLEVE, Cornelis van","(b. 1520, Antwerpen, d. after 1570, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cleve/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Joos van Cleve. He was a pupil of his father, with whom he collaborated in his father's last years. The apparent influence of Italian artists, particularly Andrea del Sarto, on Cornelis's style suggests that he visited Italy in his youth, but there is no documentary evidence for this. It is likely that Cornelis became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke following the death of his father in the winter of 1540-41, in order to continue the studio; in 1545 he joined the Guild's mutual aid association (Arbenbus). In the same year he bought a house in the city, and on 28 December 1546 he married Anna Aerts, the daughter of a parchment maker."
1087,"CLEVE, Joos van","(b. 1485, Antwerpen, d. 1540, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cleve/joos/biograph.html,"
Joos van Cleve (Joose van der Beke) Netherlandish painter, born presumably at Cleves in the lower Rhine region and active mainly in Antwerp, where he became a master painter in 1511. He is identified with the Master of the Death of the Virgin. He was dean of the painters' guild in 1515 and 1525 and seems to have been one of the most productive Antwerp painters of his time, but his career is ill-defined. There is a flavour of Leonardo in some of his works, and he may have visited Italy. The dispassionate realism of his portraits owes something to the influence of Quentin Massys, but wide stylistic differences are apparent in his work as a whole."

French sculptor and bronze-caster. He came from a family of goldsmiths of Flemish origin who settled in Paris in the early 17th century. Early biographers state that he trained with Michel or François Anguier and at the Académie Royale. He spent six years at the Académie de France in Rome, where he is said to have studied above all the sculpture of Bernini. This was followed by four years in Venice."

Flemish painter and etcher, part of a family of artists, son and pupil of Willem van Cleve I, brother of Marten van Cleve I. After his apprenticeship, he went to Italy, where he painted a signed and dated View of Rome (1550; private collection) and made a number of pen-and-ink drawings with views of Rome and Tivoli. Some of the drawings later served as models for the etched series Regionum, rurium, fundorumque, varii atque amoeni prospectus, published by Philip Galle in 1587, and were also copied by other painters."

Flemish painter, part of a family of painters of from the South Netherlands who moved from Cleve to Antwerp in the late 15th or early 16th century. He was the son of Willem I van Cleve (active 1518-1549 in Antwerp). He became a master of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1551-52 and, according to his biographer Carel van Mander, entered the workshop of Frans Floris in circa 1553-55. He eventually set up his own studio around 1556 which was highly productive in the 1560s and 1570s. Fully authenticated works by van Cleve are rare; among these are two paintings in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, one of which is dated 1566, and another signed and dated work from 1579 in the collection of The Hermitage, St. Petersburg."

English painter, part of a family of artists. He was apprenticed to a joiner in 1726 and became a professional painter by the late 1740s. He lived and worked at King's Yard Row (part of the Royal Dockyard) in Deptford, near London. A high proportion of his extant paintings depict local subjects, notably shipbuilding and ship launches, e.g. 'HMS Buckingham' on the Stocks at Deptford (1752; National Maritime Museum, Greenwich). These views are characterized by an attractively gauche sense of perspective, flat patterns and bold colours; they combine topographical accuracy in architectural detail with lively descriptions of quayside strollers, painted with a precision comparable to Canaletto's contemporary London subjects."
1092,"CLEVELEY, John the Younger","(b. 1747, Deptford, d. 1786, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cleveley/younger/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters, son of John Cleveley the Elder. He seems early in life to have held some appointment at Deptford, probably of the same nature as his father's, and while residing there he made acquaintance with Paul Sandby, who was then chief drawing master at the royal military academy at Woolwich, from whom he learnt the art of water-colour painting and tinted drawings. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1770, and up to 1782 his works are always signed 'John Cleveley, junior.' "

He also had a talent for mezzotint engraving, and this career came to a well-publicized climax in 1819 with the appearance of the large mezzotint after George Henry Harlow's The Court for the Trial of Queen Katharine, owned by Thomas Welsh. Because of its large size and the serious nature of the subject, Harlow had intended this work to be seen as a history painting, but some observers felt that it was merely theatrical. Nevertheless, Harlow's attempt to create a history painting out of a theatrical scene haunted Clint during his subsequent artistic career and inspired his most important painting The Last Scene in 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts'. This work not only follows Harlow's picture closely in size and composition but also uses the same conceit of showing a theatrical scene in historical disguise while including a gallery of contemporary portraits."

American painter. Although British by birth, he is considered to be one of the great American painters since he went to the United States at a very early age and spent the rest of his life there. He was one of the first generation of American genre painters."
1096,"CLOSTERMAN, John","(b. 1660, Osnabrück, d. 1711, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/closterm/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in England. John Closterman and John Baptist Closterman were, until the publication of the former's will in 1964, thought to be the same artist. It is now clear that 'John Closterman of Covent Garden Limner' was the elder of two artist brothers and much the more accomplished painter. According to George Vertue, he was trained by his father in Osnabrück and at the age of 19 travelled to Paris. He worked for two years in the studio of François de Troy, who ran a fashionable portrait practice. Later he established himself in London in partnership with John Riley, acting as his drapery painter in 1681-83. Through Riley he was introduced to a potential clientele for his own independent practice, which he appears to have set up in the mid-1680s. He is thought to have finished a number of Riley's portraits after his death, although Vertue recorded that the partnership had been discontinued owing to financial differences."

Italian painter and illuminator of Croatian birth (originally Juraj Klovic). The most important illuminator of the 16th century, he was a 'Michelangelo of small works', according to Vasari. Many of his documented works are dispersed or untraced, and some attributions are controversial, but his secure oeuvre gives a clear idea of his stylistic influences and development. Although much of his inspiration came from Raphael and Michelangelo, he developed his own visual language, brilliantly translating their monumental forms for work on the smallest scale."

The engraver Nicolas Cochin (1610-after 1649) left Troyes for Paris in the 1640s; he made numerous small engravings, chiefly religious subjects and landscapes, including several for Jules, Cardinal Mazarin. His prints, signed N. Cochin, are often confused with those of his half-brother Noël Cochin (1622-after 1687). It is not clear how they were related to Charles-Nicolas Cochin I and his more celebrated son Charles-Nicolas Cochin II, both of whom were employed in Paris to make reproductions after the most distinguished artists of their day. In addition to his activities as an engraver, draughtsman and writer on the theory of art, Cochin II enjoyed an illustrious public career as Secrétaire Perpétuel of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture."

1107,"CODDE, Pieter","(b. 1599, Amsterdam, d. 1678, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/codde/biograph.html,"Dutch genre and portrait painter of the fashionable world and barrack-room life, active in Amsterdam. His best works are usually on a small scale, marked by subtle silvery-gray tonalities, but he achieved one memorable feat on a much larger scale. In 1637 he was called upon to finish the group portrait of the Amsterdam Civic Guards known as the Meagre Company (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) that Frans Hals began in 1633 and refused to finish because he would not come to Amsterdam for sittings, and Codde succeeded so well in capturing Hals's spirit and the touch of his brush that experts still disagree where the work of the one ends and the other begins. Codde also wrote poetry.

1108,"CODINO, Francesco","(b. ca. 1590, Frankfurt(?)- d. ca. 1635, Italy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/codino/biograph.html,"
Francesco Codino (also called Franz Godin), German-born Italian painter, active both in Hanau/Frankfurt and Lombardy. In 1619, he trained in the atelier of Daniel Soreau (active 1586-1619) in Hanau, and between 1620 and 1624 is recorded in Lombardy where he probably died.



"

Italian architect, one of the outstanding architects in Venetian history. His work signals the change of Venetian architecture from Gothic to the Renaissance. Nowhere is this more dramatically illustrated than at the church of San Zaccaria, where the lower level of the façade begun by Antonio Gambello utilizes traditional Gothic elements and the upper levels completed by Codussi move emphatically to the classical motifs of the Renaissance. Other prominent works include San Giovanni Crisostomo and Santa Maria Formosa, and the residences Ca' Vendramin Calergi and Palazzo Zorzi. The Torre dell'Orologio (Clock Tower), built in the Piazza San Marco in Venice between 1496 and 1499, is also attributed to him.

Netherlandish painter, architect, sculptor, designer of tapestries and stained glass, writer, and publisher. A pupil of Bernard van Orley, he entered the Antwerp Guild in 1527. Some time before then he had been to Rome and in 1533 he visited Constantinople. His mission to gain business there for the Brussels tapestry works was unsuccessful, but the drawings he made on his journey were later published by his widow Mayken Verhulst as woodcut illustrations in Les Moeurs et Fachons de Faire des Turz (The Manners and Customs of the Turks, 1553).

Coello was, like Velázquez, of Portuguese descent, but became the last great painter of the School of Madrid. The principal influences on his work seem to have been Rubens, Van Dyck and Titian - that is, he used his opportunities to study the Spanish Royal collection, which had masterpieces by all of them. He also studied in Italy at some time 1656/64 and was influenced by contemporaries such as Dolci. He became Painter to the King in 1683, and was promoted Pintor de Cámara in 1686."
1113,"COENE, Jacques",(active 1398-1404),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coene/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, illustrator, and architect. He came from Bruges and is known only through written sources, the earliest of which places him in Paris in 1398, when he dictated instructions on the production of colours to Johannes Alcherius. Alcherius reproduced Coene's instructions, with information from other French and Italian painters, in a treatise of 1411 (""De coloribus diversis modis tractatur""). In 1399, on Alcherius's recommendation, Coene was one of the three consultants summoned to Milan to advise on the construction of the cathedral."
1114,"COESERMANS, Johannes",(active 1660s in Delft),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coeserma/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He joined the painters' guild in Delft as an out-of-towners in 1661. His few known works bear dates of 1660,1663, and 1664. Two of his undated oil paintings, derived from compositions by Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick van Vliet, represent interior views of the Oude Kerk in Delft. The rest of his identified oeuvre consists of pen paintings in grisaille: two small marines, an ideal townscape, and three church interiors."
1115,"COESSAET, Jan",(active 1563-1587 in Mechelen),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coessaet/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was active in Mechelen where he became a member of the painters' guild in 1563. In 1568 he bought half of a house from a painter colleague, Jerome Vaddere, in the Rue Sainte-Catherine. We only know one work by this master, ""The Opening Session of the Parliament of Burgundy on 3 January 1474"", painted in 1587 (City Hall, Mechelen).

Jules-Louis-Philippe Coignet, French painter, draftsman, and lithographer. He studied with the influential Neoclassical landscape painter Jean-Victor Bertin and in 1821 was among the competitors for the Rome Prize in Historical Landscape. From 1824 until 1857 he regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon, winning a gold medal in 1824. A constant traveler in search of picturesque motifs, he carried his explorations as far as Egypt and Syria."

1118,COLA DA CAPRAROLA,(active 1494-1518),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cola_c/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He worked with Antonio da Sangallo the Elder on the Papal palace and fortifications of La Rocca, Cività Castellana (1494-1500), and carried out other works on the fortifications of Nepi. He was involved in the building of Santa Maria della Consolazione, Todi, a centrally planned church probably derived from sketches by Leonardo da Vinci and from Bramante's designs for San Pietro, Rome. He restored Foligno Cathedral (1512-15), and built the fortress at Porto Ercole (c. 1518).



"
1119,COLA DI PETRUCCIOLI,"(active 1372, Orvieto, d. 1401, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cola_p/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Orvieto and Prerugia. He was a pupil of Ugolino di Prete Ilario (active c. 1334-after 1378), the first well-known figure in the school of Orvieto, who was charged with much of the decoration of the Duomo between 1372-78. Ugolino appears to have been significantly influenced by the Sienese master Luca di Tommé and indeed documentation exists that confirms Luca's presence in Orvieto at this time, and Ugolino's acquaintance with him."
1120,"COLE, Thomas","(b. 1801, Bolton-le-Moor, d. 1848, Catskill)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cole/biograph.html,"
American Romantic landscape painter, a founder of the Hudson River School. His family migrated to America from England in 1819 and he became passionately devoted to the natural scenery of his new country. He spent two years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Pennsylvania and made his living as a portrait painter and engraver there and in New York until some of his landscapes attracted the attention of Dunlap, Durand, and Trumbull, in 1825, assuring his success. In the following year he moved to Catskill on the Hudson River, journeying into the mountains, often on foot, to make sketches of the scenery and working his studies up into finished paintings in the studio."
1121,"COLI, Giovanni","(b. 1636, San Quirico di Lucca, d. 1681, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His career is inextricably linked with that of Filippo Gherardi, in collaboration with whom all his works were executed. The few works painted by Gherardi after Coli's death suggest that the rich colour of their joint productions came from Coli. He was a pupil of Sebastiano Gherardi, Filippo's father, and subsequently of Pietro Paolini. Coli and Gherardi then moved to Rome, training under Pietro da Cortona, from whom Coli derived his taste for Baroque amplification and a feeling for colour harking back to 16th-century Venetian models."
1122,"COLIJNS, David","(b. ca. 1582, Rotterdam, d. ca. 1666, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colijns/biograph.html,"

Collantes was the leading Spanish landscape painter of the 17th century. He was born in Madrid, but was influenced by Ribera and the Neapolitans, and also by the Venetian painters of the 16th century, especially in his landscape settings for Old Testament subjects. There are works in Bonn, Madrid, New York, Paris and Providence R I.



"
1125,"CÖLLEN, Henrik","(b. ca. 1500, d. after 1569)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collen/biograph.html,"
Henrik Cöllen (or Heinrich Köllen), German architect, active in Sweden and Finland. He was Master of the Works at Gripsholm Castle, Södermanlands (1537-45), and at Uppsala Castle (1549-51) before leaving to build fortifications in Finland. Both castles were commissioned by King Gustav I Vasa (reg 1523-1560). Gripsholm is still essentially a medieval brick structure, with four ranges and four high cylindrical towers round a courtyard. The simple ground-plans and very thick walls were, however, adapted to contemporary conditions of war, and the castle contained cannon and barracks as well as residential suites for the royal family. At Gripsholm, Cöllen combined his knowledge of late medieval castles in eastern Germany and in the Netherlands. The castle was soon thought to be out of date, however, and at Uppsala Cöllen probably played a minor part, the bastioned façade being the work of others.



"
1126,"COLLIER, Edwart","(b. ca. 1640, Breda, d. 1710, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collier/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (also spelt Colyer, Kollier) possibly of English descent. He probably trained in Haarlem, as his earliest paintings show the influence of Pieter Claesz. and Vincent Laurensz. van der Vinne. His large Vanitas Still-life (1656; private collection) was inscribed V. Laurens several times on one of the documents included in the composition. Collier was first documented in Leiden in 1667, and he was registered as a member of the Guild of St Luke from 1673 to 1680. He married in Leiden in 1670, 1677 and 1681 but was separated from his third wife on 10 April 1682. He is recorded as living in Amsterdam in 1686."
1127,"COLLIN, Rémy",(active 1597-1634),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collin/biograph.html,"

Ignazio Collino (1724-1793) and his brother Filippo Collino (1737-1801) worked together on many occasions, so that most of their output cannot be definitely attributed to one or the other. Ignazio was first taught drawing by Claudio Francesco Beaumont and sculpture by François Ladatte. In 1748 he went to study sculpture under Giovanni Battista Maini in Rome, where Filippo joined him in 1754. The brothers' earliest works are copies from the Antique. Two marble profile portraits in low relief of Alexander the Great and Alexander's mother Olympia (both 1754, Palazzo Reale), which presage the Neo-classical style, are known to be by Filippo."

1130,"COLLINS, Charles","(b. ca. 1680, Dublin, d. 1744, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collins/biograph.html,"
Irish painter primarily of dogs, exotic birds, dead game and still-lifes, and, in Vertue's phrase, 'all sorts of Birds & Game & Fowls'. He was born in Ireland, and active in Dublin; described as 'an Irish master' in the catalogue of the sale of the collection of Sir Gustavus Hume in Dublin, May 1786. Painted numerous large studies of birds in watercolour and body-colour, some of which were engraved. He was one of the first still-life painters in Britain of great quality, normally following the continental tradition of arranged breakfasts, still-lifes or cabinets of curiosities, where objects of high value and ostentation were depicted.



"
1131,"COLLINS, William","(b. 1788, London, d. 1847, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collins1/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was the son of William Collins (died 1812), a man of letters and dealer in pictures. William Collins specialized in sentimental rustic landscapes and genre scenes."
1132,"COLLOT, Marie-Anne","(b. 1748, Paris, d. 1821, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/collot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. Exclusively a portrait sculptor, the busts she produced in Paris in 1765 and 1766 show such an extraordinary precociousness that it has been suggested they are the results of a collaboration with her first teacher, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne II. In her portrait of Étienne-Noël Damilaville (terracotta; Paris, Louvre), she succeeded in expressing both the physical pain and mental anguish suffered by this forgotten philosopher."
1133,"COLOMBE, Jean","(b. ca. 1430, d. ca. 1496, Bourges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colombe/jean/biograph.html,"
French illuminator, brother of Michel Colombe. In 1463 he rented a small house in Bourges with a calligrapher, Clément Thibaut, and must by then have finished his apprenticeship. He seems to have married about the same year. On 31 August 1464 he was granted a house on a six-year lease by the chapter of Bourges Cathedral, but the decision must have been reversed, because he was installed in another house in 1465. By 1471 he had built a house on a plot of land granted to him in 1467 by the chapter of St Pierre de Puellier, Bourges, and he lived there until 1493, when it was occupied by his son Philibert. Jean then retired to a house he owned on the outskirts of Bourges, where he continued to work at a reduced pace. He was employed by Charles I, Duke of Savoy, at his court at Chambéry between 1486 and 1489."
1134,"COLOMBE, Michel","(b. ca. 1430, d. 1512, Tours)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colombe/michel/biograph.html,"French sculptor. He had a great name in his day, but only two works that are certainly by him survive, both from very late in his life. They are: the tomb of Francis II of Brittany and Marguerite Foix (Nantes Cathedral, 1502-07), done in collaboration with Jean Perréal and Girolamo da Fiesole, an Italian sculptor working in France; and a relief of St George and the Dragon (Louvre, Paris, 1508-09), done for an altarpiece for the Château de Chaillon. The latter also was a work of collaboration, for the frame was carved by Jérôme Pacherot, another Italian expatriate. Colombe's fame rests mainly on the St George, for it is a captivating work, blending the fantasy of the French Gothic style with elements of the Italianate Renaissance test that was coming into vogue in southern France at this time, yet without copying particular Italian models.

1135,"COLOMBEL, Nicolas","(b. 1644, Sotteville-les-Rouen, d. 1717, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colombel/biograph.html,"
French painter. After studying under Pierre de Sève (1623-1695) in Paris, he travelled before 1680 to Rome, where he was profoundly influenced by Raphael and, above all, by Poussin, whose drawings and paintings he copied. In 1682 he sent to Paris four paintings of subjects taken from the life of Christ, which are his first surviving works. They are Christ Expelling the Money-changers from the Temple and Christ Healing the Blind Man (both Art Museum, Saint Louis), Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen) and Mary Magdalen Brought before Christ (Museum and Picture Gallery, Vadodara)."
1136,"COLONNA, Angelo Michele","(b. 1604, Rovenna, d. 1687, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colonna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, active also in Spain. He studied and collaborated with Girolamo Curti (1575-1632) and later enjoyed a 25-year collaboration with Agostino Mitelli. A figure painter (figurista) and quadraturista, with Mitelli he emphasized the former role. In 1625, however, Colonna provided both figures (studies, Stuttgart, Staatsgalerie) and quadratura for the nave ceiling of S Alessandro, Parma; in 1635-36 he and Mitelli decorated the walls of the Sala Grande, Palazzo Spada, Rome. Only the scenographic decoration of three ground-floor rooms in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence (1639-41), and the more richly detailed frescoes in the Great Hall of the Palazzo d'Este at Sassuolo, Modena (1646-47), survive out of their complete quadratura interiors. Their finest work in Bologna was the intricate design of the chapel of the Rosary, S Domenico (1654-56). In this period they decorated a chamber in the Palazzo Balbi, Genoa, contributing to the diversity of ceiling decorations in Liguria.

French painter, architect, and sculptor, son of the miniaturist Jean-Baptiste Gilles. (Colson is also referred to as Jean-François Gilles-Colson.)"
1138,"COLYN, Alexander","(b. ca. 1526, Mechelen, d. 1612, Innsbruck)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/colyn/biograph.html,"
Alexander Colyn (Colijn or Colin), Flemish sculptor, active in Austria. He was one of the foremost sculptors active at the Habsburg courts in Innsbruck, Prague and Vienna, but his activities before 1558 are unclear. Colyn may have trained c. 1540 with his uncle, Symon Colyns (fl 1518–42), a sculptor or stonemason in Mechelen. It was suggested on the basis of style that the young sculptor was at Fontainebleau in the 1540s and then went to Italy, possibly to Milan. His reputation was well established by March 1558, when he is documented working on the façade sculpture of the Otto Heinrich Wing of Heidelberg Castle with 12 journeymen. In 1559 or 1560 he returned to Mechelen where two years later he married Marie de Vleeschouwer, probably the daughter of Anthoni de Vleeschouwer (d 1558), a sculptor whom Colyn succeeded at Heidelberg. Late in 1562 Colyn moved to Innsbruck where he spent most of the rest of his career.



"
1139,"COMIN, Giovanni","(active 1673, Treviso, d. 1695, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/comin/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was the main representative of a family of sculptors and architects originating in Treviso that included his father Leonardo Comin (active late 16th century-early 17th), his brother Francesco Comin (active 1658-1681) and his son Andrea Comin (c. 1676-after 1703). He is first recorded in 1673, when he was asked to submit a drawing for the altar of the Rosario, San Nicolò, Treviso, with which his father and brother had been involved."
1140,"COMINELLI, Andrea",(active 1643-1688),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cominell/biograph.html,"

Italian painter, born in Florence, but mostly active in Rome. He was a pupil of the painter Cigoli. He painted frescoes in the sacristy of San Carlo ai Catinari and a Fall of the Angels now in the Galleria Palatina (Palazzo Pitti) in Florence. One of his pupils was the young Pietro da Cortona who moved to Rome and became one of the towering figures of the Italian Baroque. Another pupil was Giovanni Battista Stefaneschi (1582-1659).

1142,"COMPE, Jan ten","(b. 1713, Amsterdam, d. 1761, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/compe/biograph.html,"
Jan ten Compe (Kompe), Dutch painter, draughtsman and dealer. In 1736 he became a citizen of Amsterdam, where he spent most of his life, apart from 1740 to 1755, when he lived mostly in The Hague. He was a pupil of the decorative wallpaper and landscape painter Dirk Dalens III (1688-1753). Ten Compe produced mostly views of country houses and townscapes, including Haarlem, The Hague, Amsterdam, Oudekerk aan de Amstel, Delft, Leiden, Rotterdam, Utrecht and Kleef. One of the best topographical artists of his generation, he worked in a detailed, controlled and elegant manner, influenced by such 17th-century townscape painters as Jan van der Heyden and the Berckheyde brothers, several of whose paintings he copied."
1143,"CONCA, Sebastiano","(b. 1680, Gaeta, d. 1764, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conca/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was one of the most successful painters working in Rome in the first half of the 18th century and was celebrated throughout Europe. He painted altarpieces and frescoes, creating an accomplished style that mediates between the grandeur of the late Baroque and the academic manner of Carlo Maratti. His smaller easel paintings

1144,"CONCA, Tommaso","(b. 1734, Roma, d. 1822, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conca_t/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His father was a painter and cousin to the more famous painter Sebastiano Conca; the two were Tommaso's first teachers in Baroque painting. In 1770, Tommaso was made member of Accademia di San Luca, Rome's guild of painters."
1145,"CONGNET, Gillis","(b. ca. 1538, Antwerpen, d. 1599, Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/congnet/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The son of a goldsmith of the same name, he trained as a painter with Lambert Wenselyns (active 1553) and possibly also with Antoon van Palermo (1503 or 1513-c. 1589), an Antwerp art dealer in whose house he lived. In 1561 he became a free master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Shortly afterwards he travelled to Italy, going first to Naples and Sicily and then to Terni, where he made frescoes with a painter named Stello. In 1568 he was registered as a member of the Accademia in Florence."
1146,"CONINCK, David de","(b. ca. 1644, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1701, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coninck/biograph.html,"
David de Coninck (or Koninck, also known as Rammelaer), Flemish painter. He was the pupil of Pieter Boel in 1659 in Antwerp where he became master in the Guild of St Luke in 1663. He stayed in Paris until 1669. Between 1671 and 1694 he lived in Rome where he belonged to the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome, and took the nickname (the so-called 'bent name') 'Rammelaer' (which means 'rattle')."
1147,"CONINXLOO, Gillis van","(b. 1544, Antwerpen, d. 1607, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coninxlo/biograph.html,"
Painter, draughtsman and collector, part of a Flemish family of artists whose members of at least six generations were artists, active from the late 15th century to the 17th. The family was foinded by Jan van Coninxloo I ( fl 1490). Gillis van Coninxloo (in fact Gillis van Coninxloo III) was the son of Jan van Coninxloo II. Van Mander, a contemporary of Gillis van Coninxloo III, wrote in 1604: 'He is, as far as I know, the best landscape painter of his time; his style is now frequently imitated in Holland.' His works works show the transition from Mannerist to early Baroque landscape."
1148,"CONSTABLE, John","(b. 1776, East Bergholt, d. 1837, Hampstead)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/constabl/biograph.html,"
English painter, ranked with Turner as one of the greatest British landscape artists. Although he showed an early talent for art and began painting his native Suffolk scenery before he left school, his great originality matured slowly. He committed himself to a career as an artist only in 1799, when he joined the Royal Academy Schools, and it was not until 1829 that he was grudgingly made a full Academician, elected by a majority of only one vote. In 1816 he became financially secure on the death of his father and married Maria Bicknell after a seven-year courtship and in the face of strong opposition from her family. During the 1820s he began to win recognition: The Hay Wain (National Gallery, London, 1821) won a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1824 and Constable was admired by Delacroix and Bonington among others. His wife died in 1828, however, and the remaining years of his life were clouded by despondency."
1149,"CONSTANT, Benjamin","(b. 1845, Paris, d. 1902, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/constant/biograph.html,"
Jean-Joseph-Benjamin Constant, French painter and printmaker. He spent his youth in Toulouse, where he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. A municipal scholarship enabled him to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1866. By the following year he was a student in the Ecole de la Rue Bonaparte under the history painter Alexandre Cabanel, and he competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome in 1868 and 1869."
1150,"CONSTANTINI, Ermenegildo","(b. 1731, Roma, d. 1791, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/constanx/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Rome, Velletri, Recanati and Città di Castello. He was a pupil of Marco Benefial (1684-1764). He contributed to the decoration of the Palazzo Borghese in Rome. He painted frescoes at the Chapel of the SS Sacramento at Velletri, and at the gallery of the Palazzo Antici in Recanati. He made an altarpiece with a copy of a San Nicola da Tolentino by Raphael, now in the Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello.



"
1151,"CONTE, Jacopino del","(b. ca. 1515, Firenze, d. 1598, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conte/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A pupil of Andrea del Sarto, he appears to have worked independently from around the time of Andrea del Sarto's death in 1530 and to have specialized at first in devotional works of moderate size. In such paintings as the Virgin in the Clouds (Berlin, Staatliche Museen), the Holy Family (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) and the Virgin and Child (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) he imposed a Michelangelesque monumentality and sculptural density on figure compositions that are reminiscent of the warm intimacy of Andrea del Sarto's Holy Families. This early style culminates in the Virgin and Child with Sts John the Baptist and Elizabeth (Washington, National Gallery of Art), the largest of his Florentine paintings in which the prominent figure of the Virgin in a rose-red gown dominates the sober domestic scene."
1152,"CONTE, Meiffren","(b. ca. 1631, Marseille, d. 1705, Marseille)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conte_m/biograph.html,"
Meiffren Conte (also Ephraim Lecomte), French painter. He was a still-life painter who undoubtedly studied in Italy where he was identified as ""Monsù Conti francese"". He is best recognized for his compositions that are crowded with elaborate and rich objects. Depicting rich goldsmithery mixed with nautilus shells was his speciality."
1153,"CONTI, Francesco","(b. 1681, Firenze, d. 1760, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of the protagonists of 18th-century Florentine painting. When very young, he was a follower of Simone Pignoni (1611-1698). In 1699 the Marquees Riccardi brought him to Rome, where, according to the biographers Francesco Maria Niccolò Gabburri and Orazio Marrini, writing respectively during his life and shortly after his death, was apprenticed by Carlo Maratti and Giovanni Maria Morandi (1622-1717). Back in Florence in 1705, the artist, supported by the powerful family of the Riccardi, became one of the leading artists in town, with commissions by personalities belonging to the Florentine major families, including Anna Maria Ludovica de' Medici."
1154,"CONTI, Domenico","(b. ca. 1742, Mantova, d. 1817, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/conti_d/biograph.html,"
Domenico Conti (Domenico Bazzani-Conti), Italian painter. He was trained as an artist in his native Mantua by Giuseppe Bazzani, whose surname he subsequently appended to his own. By the time of his apprenticeship to Bazzani, the latter's style had moved away from the classical style which he had learnt from the exemplars of Mantegna in Mantua, and had adopted a more exotic style typified by the ""Lunar"" canvases, moonlit and atmospheric pieces with silver tonality. Bazzani had become Director of the Mantua Accademia whilst the teacher of Conti (1767) and his style reverted to a more sombre and spiritual manner which was followed by his pupil."
1155,"CONTIN, Antonio","(b. 1566, Lugano, d. 1616, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/contin/antonio/biograph.html,"
Swiss/Italian architect and stonemason. He was born into a family of architects and sculptors from Lugano: his father was Bernardino Contin (1530-1596), his brothers Tommaso Contin (1570-1634) and Francesco Contin. He was the grandson of Antonio da Ponte whom he assisted with the construction of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. The collaboration with his grandfather started in 1591 and ended with the death of the latter in 1597."
1156,"CONTIN, Francesco","(b. 1585, Lugano, d. 1654, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/contin/francesc/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, part of a family of architects. The Swiss-born architect designed the Palazzo Mocenigo Casa Vecchia on the Grand Canal in Venice, built between 1623 and 1625. He designed also the interior of the Church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti in Venice (1634-37).

English landscape and marine painter, and gardener, the second of the eleven children of George Cooke, engraver and print publisher, and his wife, Elizabeth Harriet Eglinton (1785-1882). He was educated at Grove House School, Woodford, Essex, before receiving artistic training in the studios of his father, uncle, and family friends, during which he became deeply versed in works of the early nineteenth-century landscapists."
1158,"COOKE, George","(b. 1781, London, d. 1834, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cooke/george/biograph.html,"
English engraver, part of a family of artists, father of the painter Edward William Cooke. He was a skilled engraver who numbered John Sell Cotman, Augustus Wall Callcott and Clarkson Stanfield among his friends and whose engraved publications included The Thames (1811), The Botanical Cabinet (1817-33) and London and its Vicinity (1826-8). He is chiefly remembered today for The Southern Coast of England (1814-26), which he produced jointly with his brother William Bernard Cooke (1778-1855) and which contained 40 plates after watercolours by J. M. W. Turner and 40 by artists such as William Westall, Peter De Wint and William Collins.

On completion of his studies he embarked on a working tour of the Near East and North Africa, journeying first to Algeria followed by sorties into Morocco and Arabia."
1160,"COOPER, Abraham","(b. 1787, London, d. 1868, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cooper/biograph.html,"
English animal and battle painter. His life spans the great years of sporting painting: when he was born, Stubbs was establishing his reputation as the greatest of English painters; when he died, Landseer was retiring from painting. His work thus spans both the greatest of the Georgian and the best of the Victorian, and he has a place of especial honour amongst the sporting painters of this Golden Age."
1161,"COOPER, Thomas Sidney","(b. 1803, Canterbury, d. 1902, Vernon Holme)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cooper_t/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was encouraged in his ambition to become an artist by Sir Thomas Lawrence and the animal painter Abraham Cooper (no relation). He entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1823. He subsequently taught art in Brussels where he met Eugène Verboeckhoven, whose work had a profound influence on him. Through Verboeckhoven he came to appreciate the work of such 17th-century Dutch painters as Aelbert Cuyp and Paulus Potter. In 1831 he returned to London, exhibiting at the Royal Society of British Artists. He exhibited 48 pictures at the British Institution between 1833 and 1863. The majority of his work was, however, exhibited at the Royal Academy; from 1833 to 1902 he exhibited 266 works there without a break, and he remains the longest continuous exhibitor in the Academy's history. He was elected ARA in 1845 and RA in 1867. "
1162,"COORNHERT, Dirck Volkertsz.","(b. 1522, Amsterdam, d. 1590, Gouda)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coornher/biograph.html,"
Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert (also spelt Cuerenhert), Dutch printmaker, poet, writer, theologian and philosopher. His work as a printmaker began in Haarlem in 1547, when he made a woodcut for a lottery poster after a design of Maarten van Heemskerck. From then until 1559 Coornhert worked as Heemskerck's principal engraver. Initially he etched his plates, but during the 1550s he turned to engraving. He was possibly also responsible for the woodcuts after Heemskerck and the publication of Heemskerck's early prints. In addition, he engraved designs by Willem Thibaut (1524–97) in 1556–57, Lambert Lombard in 1556 and Frans Floris in 1554–57. During this period Philip Galle was his pupil."
1163,"COORTE, Adriaen",(active 1683-1707 around Middelburgh),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coorte/biograph.html,"

1165,"COPPENS, Augustin","(b. 1668, Brussel, d. 1740, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coppens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, engraver, draughtsman and tapestry designer active in Brussels. He specialized in landscape and city views. He is now mainly known for his tapestry designs and for his drawings and prints documenting the devastating effect on the civil buildings caused by the Bombardment of Brussels by French troops in 1695."
1166,COPPO DI MARCOVALDO,"(b. ca. 1225, Firenze, d. ca. 1274, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coppo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of the earliest about whom there is a body of documented knowledge. He served in the army of Florence and settled in Siena after his capture at the Battle of Montaperti (1260). In 1261 he painted the signed and dated Madonna and Child Enthroned (called the Madonna del Bordone) for the Servite church at Siena, and in 1274 he and his son Salerno painted a Crucifix for Pistoia Cathedral; both paintings still remain in their original locations. On the basis of these documented works two other outstanding paintings are attributed to Coppo: a Madonna and Child Enthroned in Sta Maria dei Servi in Orvieto, and a Crucifix in the Pinacoteca at San Gimignano."
1167,"COQUES, Gonzales","(b. 1614, Antwerpen, d. 1684, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coques/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Van Lerius found the artist's name in a baptismal register for the year 1614; however, an inscription on an engraved self-portrait of 1649 gives 1618 as his year of birth, and in 1666 he himself claimed to be 48. His name is listed in the archives of Antwerp's Guild of St Luke for 1627-28, the year he became a pupil of Pieter Brueghel the Younger. Later he studied with David Ryckaert the Younger. Coques was admitted to the painters' guild as an independent master only in 1640-41, this long delay suggesting that he travelled. He may have gone to England, for he was later given the nickname 'Little van Dyck', referring to the perceived influence on his work of Anthony van Dyck, who was in England after 1632."
1168,"CORDIER, Nicolas","(b. 1565, Saint-Mihiel, d. 1612, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cordier/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter, active also in Italy. He trained at Saint-Mihiel in the workshop of the Richier family, where he learnt the late Mannerist style current in Lorraine and much of northern Europe at the end of the 16th century. By c. 1590 he was working for Duke Charles III of Lorraine at Nancy, where he executed sculpture in wood (untraced). Late in 1592, at the expense of Charles III, he left for Rome, where he remained for the rest of his life."
1169,"CORDIER, Charles-Henri-Joseph","(b. 1827, Cambrai, d. 1905, Algiers)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cordierc/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He trained at the Petite Ecole (Ecole Spéciale de Dessin et de Mathématiques) in Paris, then with François Rude. He exhibited for the first time at the 1848 Salon, showing a plaster bust of Said Abdallah of the Darfour Tribe in Sudan. This was exhibited in the same year that slavery was abolished in all French colonies. It is now housed at The Walters Art Museum."
1170,"CORDOBA, Pedro de",(active in 1470s in Cordoba),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cordova/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. The son of Juan de Córdoba, he was active in Córdoba in the second half of the 15th century. He is known to have carried out an altarpiece in Córdoba Cathedral, an Annunciation and a Nativity. These two works are signed and dated 1475, with Canon Sanchez de Castro as donor.



"
1171,"CORINTH, Lovis","(b. 1858, Tapiau, d. 1925, Zandvoort)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corinth/biograph.html,"
German painter and writer. He grew up on his family's farm and tannery. As a child he showed interest in art, taking informal lessons in drawing from a local carpenter and caricaturing his primary school teachers. Corinth's father sent him to secondary school in the nearby city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), where he lived with his widowed aunt. A superstitious woman fond of story-telling, she possessed what Corinth later described as a coarse temperament and an unrestrained, 'demonic' humour. These qualities and his aunt's bohemian acquaintances, including fortune-tellers and soothsayers, fascinated the young Corinth, accustomed to his more reserved parents. In this environment Corinth began to develop the rich imagination and love of anecdote that came to play such an important role in the evolution of his art."
1172,"CORIOLANO, Cristoforo","(b. 1540, Nürnberg, d. ca. 1600, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coriolan/biograph.html,"
German engraver. He moved to Italy and changed his name from Lederer for that of Coriolano. In the Life of Marcantonio Raimondi, the biographer Vasari stated that Maestro Cristofano, after achieving some success in Venice, engraved on wood the portraits of the painters, sculptors, and architects, after Vasari's designs, for his Lives of the Painters, first published in 1568. Others consider them to be the work of Christopher Krieger. He also engraved the greater part of the figures in the Ornithology of Ulisse Aldrovandi."
1173,"CORMON, Fernand","(b. 1845, Paris, d. 1924, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cormon/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied initially in Brussels under Jean-François Portaels (1818-1895). In 1863 he returned to Paris, where for three years he was a pupil of Alexandre Cabanel and Eugène Fromentin. He made his début at the Salon in 1868 and in 1870 received a medal for the Marriage of the Niebelungen (1870; private collection). His painting the Death of King Ravana (1875; Musée des Augustins, Toulouse), taken from the Indian epic poem the Ramayana, was criticized for the choice of an obscure subject but was nevertheless awarded the Prix de Salon in 1875. Soon afterwards Cormon left France for Tunisia."
1174,"CORNACCHINI, Agostino","(b. 1683, Pescia, d. 1754, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cornacch/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, draughtsman and painter. He moved with his family to Florence in 1697, entering the workshop of Giovanni Battista Foggini, principal sculptor to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Early in his career he received some important commissions: in 1709, when the English antiquarian John Talman arrived in Florence looking for artists to illustrate Italy's most famous monuments of art, he chose Cornacchini to do a number of the drawings, and in 1710 Cornacchini signed and dated a marble standing statue of Clement XI (Urbino Cathedral). He was also patronized by the influential Francesco Maria Niccolò Gabburri, who commissioned from him, probably before 1712, stucco decorations (destroyed early 19th century) for his own Palazzo Giuntini. Gabburri accompanied Cornacchini when he departed for Rome in 1712, establishing him in the household of his uncle, Cardinal Carlo Agostino Fabbroni, who until 1720 provided Cornacchini with a studio, lodgings and an income."
1175,CORNEILLE DE LYON,"(b. 1500/10, The Hague, d. after 1574, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corneill/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish-born painter, active mainly at Lyons in France. He was a native of The Hague (in France he is still often known as ""Corneille de La Haye""), but he settled in Lyons in 1534 and in 1540 he became court painter to the Dauphin, later Henry II. Contemporary references to Corneille indicate that he had a considerable reputation as a portrait painter, but only one work survives that is unquestionably from his hand, a portrait of Pierre Aymeric (Louvre, Paris, 1553), authenticated by an inscription in the sitter's handwriting on the back of the picture. Many other works in a similar style go under his name. They are mostly small in scale and sharply naturalistic in manner, with the sitter usually set against a plain green or blue background.

1176,"CORNEILLE, Michel I","(b. ca. 1601, Orléans, d. 1664, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corneilm/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a French family of artists. Originally from Orléans, Michel Corneille I established himself in Paris as a painter of religious pictures, although he also carried out some interior decorations as well as cartoons for tapestries. He was a founder-member of the Académie Royale in 1648. His elder son, Michel Corneille II (1642-1708), who became the family's most successful member, was a prolific artist; like his younger brother Jean-Baptiste Corneille (1649-1695), he concentrated on religious pictures for both private and ecclesiastical patrons. Both these sons also practised as engravers."
1177,CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM,"(b. 1562, Haarlem, d. 1638, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, also known as Cornelis Cornelisz, who ranks with Hendrik Goltzius and Karel van Mander as one of the leading representatives of Mannerism in the Netherlands. The three artists founded the Haarlem Academy, which was a school for drawing from the nude. He is best known for his large biblical and historical pictures packed with athletic, life-size Italianate nudes in wrenched and sharply foreshortened positions. But he also did a few forceful portraits of individuals and groups which show that he was an important forerunner of Frans Hals. Both facets of his work can best be seen in the Frans Halsmuseum in Haarlem, where he spent most of his life, after traveling in France and the Netherlands, but not, apparently, in Italy.



"
1178,"CORNELIUS, Peter","(b. 1783, Düsseldorf, d. 1867, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corneliu/biograph.html,"
German painter, best known for the major part he played in the revival of fresco in the 19th century. After training at the Düsseldorf Academy Cornelius moved to Italy in 1811 and joined the Nazarenes in Rome. In 1819 he was called to Munich by Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (later Ludwig I), for whom he worked extensively, notably on a series of frescos in the Ludwigskirche (1836-39), including a Last Judgement that is larger than Michelangelo's in the Sistine Chapel. When this work was not well received Cornelius left Munich to work for Frederick William IV of Prussia in Berlin. His major undertaking there was a commission for frescos in a mausoleum for the royal family. The project was officially cancelled after the revolution in 1848, but Cornelius continued to work on his drawings for it for the rest of his life."
1179,"CORNELISZ VAN OOSTSANEN, Jacob","(b. ca. 1472, Oostzan, d. 1533, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corneliz/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter and designer. He worked mainly in Amsterdam, where he was the leading designer of woodcuts, liberating the Dutch woodcut from the miniature tradition and giving it a new power and breadth. Comparatively few of his works have been preserved: among the woodcuts is a series illustrating the Passion (1512-17) and among the paintings are a Self-portrait (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1533) and an Adoration of the Shepherds (Museo de Capodimonte, Naples, 1512) which contains pudgy angels playing toy-like instruments, singing and decorating with garlands an improbable Renaissance manger. Although his work is somewhat provincial, he marks the beginning of the great artistic tradition of Amsterdam, and his keenness of observation was to be one of the trademarks of later Dutch art. Jan van Scorel was his most important pupil. His rather conservative workshop later was run by his painter son, Dirck Jacobsz (c. 1497-1567).



"
1180,"CORNET, Jacobus Ludovicus","(b. 1815, Leiden, d. 1882, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cornet/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and engraver. He often depicted Dutch historic scenes and figures (particularly from the Dutch Golden Age), contributing several paintings to Jacob de Vos Jacobszoon's gallery of oil paintings depicting scenes from Dutch history. Cornet also painted and drew portraits, landscapes, interiors and a range of other subjects."
1181,"CORNIOLE, Giovanni delle","(b. ca. 1470, Pisa, d. ca. 1516, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corniole/biograph.html,"
Giovanni delle Corniole (Giovanni delle Opere) was an Italian lapidary. A lapidary (the word means ""concerned with stones"") is an artisan who forms stone, mineral, gemstones, and other suitably durable materials (amber, shell, jet, pearl, copal, coral, horn and bone, glass and other synthetics) into decorative items (e.g. cameos, cabochons, and faceted designs)."
1182,"CORONA, Leonardo","(b. 1561, Murano, d. 1605, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corona/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was first taught by his father, Michele Corona, an illuminator, and later entered the workshop of Master Rocco, a copyist of antique works, but the main influences on his development were the works of Titian, Veronese and Jacopo Tintoretto. Between 1577 and 1585 Corona painted three grisailles for the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Doge's Palace, Venice. These were rather clumsily modelled on the work of Veronese, but they nevertheless secured Corona the commission to decorate the walls of the same room with the story of the Doge Enrico Dandolo (destroyed)."
1183,"COROT, Jean-Baptiste Camille","(b. 1796, Paris, d. 1875, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corot/biograph.html,"
French painter. His early training, from 1822 onwards, was with the classicising landscape painters Michallon and Bertin, and in 1825 he went to Italy, via Switzerland, for two years. He spent most of his time in and around Rome, where he developed, through painting on the spot, his sensitive treatment of light, form and distance in terms of tonal values rather than by colour and drawing. In this he resembled Georges Michel (whom he knew), but never to the point of abandoning, for works to be exhibited, the traditional classical or religious subject; this he used as a disguise for his unconventional vision, although these carefully composed landscapes have little of the spontaneity of his sketches from nature."
1184,"CORRADINI, Antonio","(b. 1668, Padova, d. 1752, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corradin/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was trained in Venice and became one of the best known sculptors of his period in Venice. When called to Naples by Raimondo di Sangro, Antonio Corradini had come to the end of a career that had taken him through Germany, Austria, and Bohemia; his Rococo style was understandably permeated with foreign influences. He died in Naples where he did the greater part of his work. He excelled in veiled statues (Modesty, Sansevero Chapel, Naples). His bas-reliefs, in a very pictorial style, are extremely delicate.



"
1185,CORREGGIO,"(b. ca. 1490, Correggio, d. 1534, Correggio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/correggi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, named after the small town in Emilia where he was born. (His real name was Antonio Allegri.) His career is poorly documented and his training has to be conjectured on stylistic grounds. Echoes of Mantegna's manner in many of his early paintings indicate that he may have studied that master's work in Mantua, and he was influenced in these works also by Lorenzo Costa and Leonardo, adopting Costa's pearly Ferrarese colouring and, in the St John of the St Francis altarpiece (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, 1514), his first documented work, Leonardo's characteristic gesture of the pointing finger. Later he developed a style of conscious elegance and allure with soft sfumato and gestures of captivating charm. Correggio may well have visited Rome early in his career, although Vasari maintains that he never went there and the obvious inspiration of the paintings of Raphael and Michelangelo could be accounted for by drawings and prints that were known all over Italy. Although he worked mainly in provincial centres, he was one of the most sophisticated artists of his time, blending disparate sources into a potent synthesis.

"
1186,"CORT, Cornelis","(b. 1536, Hoorn, d. 1578, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cort/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish engraver who studied under Hieronymus Cock of Antwerp. About 1536 he went to Venice, where Titian employed him to execute the well-known copperplates of St Jerome in the Desert, the Magdalen, Prometheus, Diana and Actaeon, and Diana and Calisto. From Italy he wandered back to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567, proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced engravings from all the great masters of the time."
1187,"CORTE, Gabriel de la","(b. 1648, Madrid, d. 1694, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corte/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was, together with Bartolomé Pérez, the most important painter of flowers in Madrid during the reign of Charles II (1665-1700). However, unlike his rival, it appears that De la Corte did not enjoy the distinction of royal patronage. His earliest biographer, Antonio Palomino, who could have known the artist in his later years, writes that he was reduced to earning his living by selling his works on the open market and that he died in poverty in 1694. He was a highly prolific artist, a fact that is reflected by the large numbers of flower paintings by his hand known today. Although his works were popular among collectors of his time, his evident facility in his chosen genre of painting may have led him to overproduce and undersell his works. In contrast to his unfortunate professional circumstances, his flower pieces are exuberant, effusive works that exemplify the important decorative role that flower paintings had assumed by the latter part of the 17th century.



"
1188,"CORTE, Juan de la","(b. ca. 1590, Flanders, d. 1662, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corte_j/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter of Flemish origin. He probably trained in Antwerp, but by 1613 he was in the service of the Spanish crown and his long life was spent in Madrid. He specialized in the painting of landscapes, battle scenes and studies in perspective, genres that had a long tradition in Flanders but not in Spain. His paintings show a consistent style without particular development. Works by him dated between 1623 (Fiesta in the Plaza Mayor, Madrid; Madrid, Museo Municipal) and 1642 (the Destruction of Sennacherib's Army; Madrid, Museo Cerralbo) adhere faithfully to compositional arrangements in Flemish models of the circle of Sebastiaen Vrancx and Louis de Caullery."
1189,"CORTE, Niccolò da","(b. before 1507, Porlezza, d. 1552, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corte_n/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and mason, active also in Spain. His father was from Lake Lugano and da Corte probably received his training in the circle of Agostino Busti (c. 1483-1548) in Milan. It was no doubt here that he met Giovanni Giacomo della Porta, who was active in the Milan Cathedral stone masons' lodge. In 1528-29 da Corte was in Genoa and Savona. His first known work, the inscribed plaque and surrounding sculptural decoration above the portal of the Palazzo Andrea Doria, Genoa, was executed in 1528."
1190,"CORTESE, Cristoforo",(active c. 1399-before 1445 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cortese/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. A pivotal figure in early 15th-century Venetian manuscript illumination, he was first mentioned as a 'miniator' in the Mariegola (rule book) of the Scuola di Santa Caterina dei Sacchi, Venice (Venice, Museo Correr, MS. IV, 118), written around the turn of the 15th century. A note indicating his paternity ('filio ser Marci') in a document of 1420 indicates that he was a brother of Franceschina, wife of Giovanni di Francia. The latter has been identified with Zanino di Pietro, a painter who influenced Cortese's style."
1191,PIETRO DI CORTONA,"(b. 1596, Cortona, d. 1669, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cortona/biograph.html,"Pietro da Corrtona (originally Pietro Berrettini), Italian painter, architect, decorator, and designer, second only to Bernini as the most versatile genius of the full Roman Baroque style. He was named after his birthplace in Tuscany and probably had some training with his father, a stonemason, before being apprenticed as a painter in Florence. In 1612 or 1613 he moved to Rome.

"
1192,"CORTVRIENDT, Jan","(d. 1681, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cortvrie/biograph.html,"
Flemish master joiner and architect. He worked as a joiner on the monumental oak choir-stalls (1663) for the abbey of Groenendaal near Brussels. When the monastery was dissolved in 1783, the stalls were transferred to Notre-Dame in Vilvoorde. They are the earliest ones in the southern Netherlands that were executed in a mature Baroque style, employing life-sized figures for the first time, here in the form of angels carrying instruments of the Passion, placed against a high wainscot with twisted columns."
1193,"CORVI, Domenico","(b. 1721, Viterbo, d. 1803, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/corvi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver. After some early works in Viterbo and Palestrina, Corvi moved on to Rome to work under Francesco Mancini (c. 1679-1758), working in a Roman milieu where late-Rococo of Pompeo Batoni and the incipient Neoclassicism of Anton Raphael Mengs coexisted, and fashioned a style in between."
1194,"COSIJN, Jan","(b. 1646, Brussel, d. 1708, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cosijn/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect and sculptor whose name is attached to the reconstruction of the Grand Place of Brussels. He became master sculptor in 1678. He built the Bellona House in Brussels in 1697 for Prince Eugène of Savoy-Carignan. On the Grand Place the Maison du Roi d'Espagne and the Maison de la Brouette are attributed to him because of the resemblance to the Bellona House.

His style has many affinities with that of Tura and the same background of development from Mantegna and Piero della Francesca, but Cossa's work reveals a more genial temperament and relaxed urbanity. This found expression in the delightful frescoes of the Months in the Palazzo Schifanoia at Ferrara; Cossa, Roberti, and Tura are all thought to have contributed to the scheme, but Cossa seems to have been the leading master. In the early 1470s he moved to Bologna, where he painted an altarpiece for the Griffoni Chapel in the church of San Petronio (1473); the central panel is in the National Gallery, London.





"
1198,"COSSIERS, Jan","(b. 1600, Antwerpen, d. 1671, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cossiers/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. His earliest works were Caravaggesque genre scenes and later specialized in histories and religious subjects. He studied under Cornelis de Vos in Antwerp before travelling to Aix-en-Provence and then to Rome by 1624. By 1626 he had returned to Aix and had contact with, among others, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the famous humanist, who recommended him to Rubens. By 1627 he had settled back in Antwerp, and in 1628 he entered Antwerp's guild of St. Luke. In 1630 he married for the first time; he married a second time in 1640."

Italian painter, probably the son of Ippolito Costa (1506-1561), grandson of Lorenzo Costa the Elder. It is likely that his early training was with his father in Mantua in the period after the death (1546) of Giulio Romano, when the architect Giovanni Battista Bertani was a major influence. Three of Lorenzo's paintings are mentioned in a document dated 1560; in 1561 he was paid for a banner (untraced) for the chapter house of Mantua Cathedral."
1201,"COSTA E SILVA, José da","(b. 1747, Lisboa, d. 1819, Rio de Janeiro)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/costa_e/biograph.html,"

1202,"COSTA, Giovanni","(b. 1826, Roma, d. 1903, Marina di Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/costa_g/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied in the Neo-classical tradition in Rome with Vincenzo Camuccini, Francesco Podesti (1800-1895), and Francesco Coghetti (1802-1875); he employed the basic academic techniques of painting a scene or figure in mezza macchia, or half-tones, which he also applied to his landscape paintings."
1203,"COSTA LIMA, Joaquim da","(b. 1806, Porto, d. 1864, Porto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/costa_l/biograph.html,"
Portuguese architect and urban planner. He was the nephew and godson of Joaquim da Costa Lima Sampaio, architect of Oporto between 1822 and 1837 (the year of his death). He joined the Academia Portuense de Belas Artes in 1838, he was acting secretary in 1842 and director in 1853. Like the uncle and godfather, with whom he worked at the beginning of his professional life, Costa Lima was also appointed architect of the Public Works division of the Câmara do Porto, in 1853."
1204,"COSTER, Adam de","(b. ca. 1586, Mechelen, d. 1643, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coster/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Little is known about his life and training. He became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1607; it is assumed that he travelled to Italy in his formative years. Here he would have been in touch with the works of Caravaggio and his followers, which would have such an important influence on his style and subject matter. De Coster had strong personal ties with Italy as some of his close relatives emigrated to Italy where they worked as painters."

English miniaturist, draughtsman, dealer and collector, a pupil of Thomas Hudson. Probably the son of a schoolmaster, he showed a precocious talent for drawing and studied at Shipley's Drawing School in the Strand, where he won several prizes. He attended the Richmond House academy, set up by Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, where he met Giovanni Battista Cipriani. He first exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1760, showing there again between 1767 and 1779. He also showed at the Free Society of Artists between 1761 and 1766. In 1769 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, becoming an ARA in 1770, when he began to exhibit at the Academy, and RA the following year."
1208,"COT, Pierre-Auguste","(b. 1837, Bedarieux, d. 1883, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cot/biograph.html,"
French painter. He received his early artistic training in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Toulouse before settling in Paris in the 1850s. In Paris, Cot studied under Alexander Cabanel, Léon Cogniet (1794-1880), and William Bouguereau. Throughout the 1860s and 1870s, Cot established himself through his participation in the annual Salon, eventually winning several medals for his mythological, historical, and allegorical paintings, as well as his portraits."
1209,"COTELLE, Jean II","(b. 1642, Paris, d. 1708, Villiers-sur-Marne)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cotelle/biograph.html,"
French painter, draughtsman, miniature painter and engraver. He studied drawing with his father Jean Cotelle I (1607-76), an ornamental painter at the court of Louis XIII. He went on to learn miniature painting with Elisabeth Sophie Chéron and portraiture with Claude Lefèbvre. He spent the years 1662-70 in Rome under the protection of Anne, Princesse de Rohan-Guéménée, and in 1672 was received (reçu) by the Académie Royale as a miniature painter on presentation of the Entry of the King and Queen into Paris (untraced). In 1681 he painted the Marriage at Cana (untraced) as that year's 'May' (the picture commissioned annually by the Paris Goldsmiths' Corporation for the Cathedral of Notre-Dame). His portraits are now known only through engravings, such as that of the Princesse de Rohan-Guéménée made by François de Poilly I."
1210,"COTER, Colijn de","(b. ca. 1446, Bruxelles, 1538, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coter/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Contracts survive for two lost works by this artist: one of 1493, in the ledgers of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp, names a 'Colyn van Brusele' as a master of the Guild, commissioned by the Confraternity of St Luke to decorate the vault of its chapel in Onze Lieve Vrouw (later the cathedral); the other, in the accounts of the Confraternity of St Eligius, Brussels, reveals that Coter undertook in 1509-10 to paint the doors of a tabernacle, which was completed in 1511. The dates of these documents mark the known boundaries of Coter's artistic activity, but his surviving work suggests these may be extended from 1480 to 1525."
1211,"COTES, Francis","(b. 1726, London, d. 1770, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cotes/biograph.html,"
English painter and pastellist. He was the son of an apothecary and the elder brother of Samuel Cotes (1734-1818), a painter in miniature. Around 1741 he was apprenticed to George Knapton, who taught him to paint in oil and to draw in crayon, at which he became very accomplished. Rosalba Carriera had popularised crayon portraiture among Grand Tourists in Venice, and her example no doubt helped Cotes in his early work. Nevertheless, he did not imitate her soft modelling and delicate colour in such portraits as Elizabeth, Lady Carysfoot (1751; University of Michigan, Museum of Art, Ann Arbor), in which he used bold tones, strong lines and an almost universal portrait format, established in the 1740s and 1750s. He was fortunate in making crayon portraits of Maria Gunning and Elizabeth Gunning (1751; versions in National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, National Portrait Gallery, London; and elsewhere), as his work reached a wide public through engravings made after them."
1212,"COTMAN, Frederick George","(b. 1850, Ipswich, d. 1920, Felixstowe)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cotman/frederic/biograph.html,"
English painter, nephew of the painter and etcher John Sell Cotman (1782-1842). He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1868. He was a regular exhibitor of both oils and watercolours, showing at the Royal Academy from 1871 onwards. His The Death of Eucles (Town Hall, Ipswich) won him a gold medal in 1873. "
1213,"COTMAN, John Sell","(b. 1782, Norwich, d. 1842, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cotman/john/biograph.html,"
English painter and etcher. He moved from Norwich to London in 1798, aged 16, and became a member of Dr Monro's circle. As far as is known, he had no formal tuition in art, but by 1800 he was already accomplished enough to have six of his watercolours accepted for the annual Royal Academy exhibition."
1214,"COTTART, Pierre","(b. ca. 1630, d. 1701, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cottart/biograph.html,"
French architect and engraver. Although his name appears in the accounts of the king's works between 1670 and 1674, and he received a royal pension from 1697, his career is relatively obscure. His first engravings date from 1649, and his Recueil de plusieurs pieces d'architecture, consisting of 12 plates and dedicated to Charles de Rostaing, was reprinted in 1660. It included the chapel of the Fathers of Mercy (destroyed) in the Rue des Archives, for which Cottart had proposed an elevation incorporating in the lower part the ground floor erected by Charles Chamois. Germain Boffrand completed the building 40 years later."
1215,"COTTE, Robert de","(b. 1656, Paris, d. 1735, Passy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cotte/biograph.html,"
French architect. By 1676 de Cotte was working in the office of Jules Hardouin-Mansart who became premier architecte to Louis XIV. De Cotte became Mansart's most valued assistant in the Service des Bâtiments du Roi."
1216,"COUDER, Auguste","(b. 1790, London, d. 1873, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/couder/biograph.html,"
French painter. A pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault and Jacques-Louis David, he exhibited for the first time in the Salon of 1814 with The Death of General Moreau (Brest, Musée Municipal). In 1817 The Levite of Ephraim (Arras, Abbaye St Vaast, Musée des Beaux-Arts) was widely praised by the critics. In 1818 he received his first official commission, for the decoration of the vaulted ceiling of the vestibule to the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre (in situ)."
1217,"COURBET, Gustave","(b. 1819, Ornans, d. 1877, La Tour-de-Peilz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/courbet/biograph.html,"
French painter, born at Ornans, near the Swiss border of France. He was in Paris by 1839, working under a minor painter, in the so-called Ateliers Libres and in the Louvre, copying Dutch, Flemish, Venetian and Spanish pictures, as well as works by Delacroix and Géricault. Much later - characteristically - he claimed to have been self-taught. He exhibited at the Salon regularly only after the State bought his After Dinner at Ornans (1849, Lille), when the award of a medal exempted him from the jury system, until the privilege was abolished in 1857. He often exhibited in the provinces, which were generally less acidly critical than Paris, and he made many trips to Belgium, Holland and Germany between 1846 and 1868, exhibiting there with more success than in France."
1218,"COURT, Joseph-Désiré","(b. 1797, Rouen, d. 1865, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/court/biograph.html,"
French painter and museum director. In 1817 he entered the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under Antoine-Jean Gros. In 1821 he won the Prix de Rome with Samson Handed over to the Philistines by Delilah (1821; Paris, Ecole Normal Supérieur). He began exhibiting at the Salon in 1824 and in 1827 showed Scene from the Deluge (1827; Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts), painted while he was in Rome, and the Death of Caesar (Paris, Louvre). The latter proved a sensational success: it was initially bought by the Musée du Luxembourg, Paris, and was re-exhibited in 1855 before being sent to the Louvre. The subject derives from Plutarch and shows Antony stirring the Roman citizens to avenge the murder of Caesar. It was praised chiefly for its dramatic composition."
1219,"COURT, Jean de",(active 1555-1585),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/court_j/biograph.html,"
The Limoges enamellers signing 'Jean de Court' and 'Jean Court dit Vigier' are probably the same person, and probably identical with the court painter Jean de Court who was employed by the French royal court in 1558 and worked for Mary Stuart in 1562. This Jean de Court replaced François Clouet as peintre du roi in 1572 and is last recorded in 1585. No signed paintings by him are known.



"
1220,"COURTEYS, Pierre",(c. 1520-c. 1586),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/courteys/biograph.html,"
French enameler. He was one of the best enamel painters of Limoges, and an excellent designer and colourist, probably a disciple of Pierre Reymond. The dates affixed to his works range from 1550 to 1568. In 1559 he executed for the façade of the château of Madrid, built by Francis I and Henry II in the Bois de Boulogne, near Paris, twelve oval medallions of the Virtues and the gods of Olympus, with figures the size of life. Nine of these are now in the Hôtel de Cluny, and three are in England. They are the largest enamels which have ever been made at Limoges."

French painter, who together with his brother Guillaume were active  in Italy and often known by the Italian forms of the names, Giacomo and Guglielmo Cortese. They came from Burgundy and both had the nickname Il Borgognone or Le Bourguignon.

1224,"COURTONNE, Jean","(b. 1671, Paris, d. 1739, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/courtonn/jean/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the most important member of a family of architects active in Paris. His early work included adding a storey to the Hôtel de Sillery (1712) and additions to the Hôtel de Vendôme (1715) in the Rue d'Enfer, but his most significant contribution was the design of two hôtels particuliers in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the fashionable neighbourhood on the west bank of the Seine. About 1720 he drew up plans for the first of these, the Hôtel de Matignon (in the Rue de Varenne), built 1722-24 for Christian-Louis de Montmorency-Luxembourg, Prince of Tingry. Despite the lack of Classical orders on the exterior elevations of the corps de logis, the overwhelming effect of the Hôtel de Matignon, as observers at the time noted, was closer to that of a palace than an hôtel particulier."

Painter and designer, part of a French family of painters, draughtsmen and designers. From the 17th century until the 20th century, historians had fused two artists, father and son, into one personality that had become almost entirely mythical, with a career that spanned virtually the entire 16th century. Archival researches demonstrated that there had been an elder Jean Cousin, born probably no earlier than 1490 and surely not much after 1505, who died in 1560 or possibly 1561, and a younger Jean Cousin, his son, also an artist, who was a student at the University of Paris in 1542 and died around 1595. A seemingly unrelated sculptor of the same name was active in Paris in the 1540s but was dead by 1549. No work by him has been identified, but he was commissioned in 1541 to execute six statues for the cloisters of the convent of the Célestins in Paris."

Although few paintings can be securely attributed to Jean Cousin the Elder, he was a major figure in the classicizing trend of French art in the 1540s and 1550s. Jean Cousin the Younger is a more shadowy figure, who carried on his father's workshop and style into the second half of the 16th century."

Pieter Coustens (Pierre Coustain), Franco-Flemish painter and designer. He is first documented painting stained glass in Philip the Good's Burgundian castle of Argilly in 1448 and 1452. He was appointed a painter to the Duke in January 1454, just before he worked with Colard le Voleur, Master of the Entertainments at Hesdin, on fountains and other machines for the Banquet of the Pheasant in Lille. During the next years, he was responsible for painting the banners and heralds' tabards for several court festivities and funerals. He coloured statues of St Philip and St Elizabeth on the ducal palace in Brussels in 1462 and painted a Crucifixion and a Virgin and Child on the panels placed at the head and foot of the Duke's catafalque in 1467.

French historical and portrait painter, a pupil of Gros and Delaroche. He is chiefly remembered for his vast 'orgy' picture The Romans of the Decadence (Musée du Louvre, Paris), which was the sensation of the Salon of 1847. As with other 'one-picture painters', his reputation has sunk with that of his big work, which now is often cited as the classic example of the worst type of bombastic academic painting, impeccable in every detail and totally false in overall effect. His more informal works, however, are often much livelier in conception and technique, and as a teacher he encouraged direct study from landscape. Manet was his best-known pupil, and others included Puvis de Chavannes and Fantin-Latour.

Genre paintings inspired by Gerard van Honthorst and other Utrecht painters date from 1626 onward, but Van Couwenbergh did not join the Delft guild until 1627. in 1630 he married Elisabeth van der Dussen, whose father was a prominent brewer and East India Company officer who also held the civic offices of burgomaster and sheriff in Delft.

Spanish architect and sculptor. Recognized as an innovator by his contemporaries, he was one of the most important members of the first generation of Spanish Renaissance architects, who proved able to develop from the Gothic and Plateresque styles prevalent in the first decades of the 16th century to the purest unornamented style ultimately inspired by Sebastiano Serlio. His artistic evolution was not the result of a direct knowledge of Italian art but was acquired from the treatise literature and from the suggestions of other Spanish architects who, unlike him, had travelled to Italy."

He lived by teaching and published several books, of which the best-known is the Treatise on Landscape Painting and Effect in Watercolours (1813-14, reprinted 1922). His favourite painting ground was North Wales, but he visited Holland and Belgium in 1826 and France in 1829 and 1832. His effects are extremely broad, with a vigour of handling that sometimes appears forced, as if for exhibition."

From the age of 18 Coypel collaborated with Charles Errard le fils, who was considered the most important designer of decorative schemes in Paris, until Errard was appointed director of the Académie de France in Rome in 1666.

1243,"COYSEVOX, Antoine","(b. 1640, Lyon, d. 1720, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/coysevox/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, with Girardon the most successful of Louis XIV's reign. His style was more Baroque than Girardon's and Coysevox overtook his rival in popularity towards the end of the 17th century as the king's taste turned away from the classical. By 1679 Coysevox was working at Versailles, where he made numerous statues for the gardens and did much interior decoration, including a striking relief of Louis XIV in the Salon de la Guerre. His originality, however, is seen mostly in his portrait busts, which show a naturalism of conception and an animation of expression that look forward to the Rococo. This is particularly so with his portraits of friends, but even his formal commissions can be remarkably lively. The Wallace Collection, London, has an outstanding example of both his formal and informal portraits: the marble Louis XIV (c. 1686) and the terracotta Charles Lebrun (1676).

Frans Crabbe van Espleghem, Flemish printmaker. Friedländer first identified the Master of the Crayfish (Dutch: Crabbe) as Frans Crabbe in 1921. It seems likely that Crabbe met and was influenced by Albrecht Dürer during the latter's visit to Mechelen in June 1521. In 1539 Crabbe acquired the workshop of Nicolaas Hogenberg, he is recorded in Mechelen as a master in the Guild of St Luke and head of the Brotherhood of Our Lady. His work is transitional, combining late northern medieval subjects and compositions with a style and technique showing the influence of the Italian Renaissance. He was especially indebted to Lucas van Leyden in his concern for atmosphere and depth in landscape, and to Jan Gossart for Italianate figure types."

Netherlandish designer of stained-glass panes and windows in the sixteenth century. As well as being a glass artist, he also designed tapestries and drew maps. Crabeth was the son of glass painter Pieter Dircksz. From an extant drawing by Dirck it seems that the painter Jan van Scorel had considerable influence on his work. In 1550, Crabeth began receiving commissions for monumental projects. Together with his brother Wouter he worked in the period 1555-1571 on windows for St Jan's church in Gouda. These famous stained-glass windows survived the Iconoclast Fury, after which more windows were added. The cartoons for most of the windows have survived.

During his stay in Antwerp, he was strongly influenced by Jan Davidsz. de Heem. His small oeuvre consists of fruit and flower pieces and larger, more ambitious banquet pieces depicting fine foodstuffs and tableware, situated near the corner of a table. In these banquets, his choice of items invariably includes abundant displays of fruit, together with a joint of meat, or a lobster, crab or oysters."

In 1633, Adriaen Brouwer, a prominent genre painter, was imprisoned for tax debts at the Antwerp jail where his future pupil baked bread. Craesbeeck soon enrolled as both a baker and a painter in the Guild of Saint Luke. Eighteen years later he had moved to Brussels, where he was a master in the painter's guild and later became a town representative."

Schuchardt, who discovered his existence, credits him with an altar-piece at Weimar, signed with the monogram ""H. C."", and dated 1537. He died at Bologna in 1537. Luther mentions his death in his 'Table Talk,' and Johann Stigel, a contemporary poet, celebrates him as a painter.



"
1252,"CRANACH, Lucas the Elder","(b. 1472, Kronach, d. 1553, Weimar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cranach/lucas_e/biograph.html,"
Lucas Cranach the Elder was a German Renaissance painter and graphic artist who excelled in portraits and in female nudes. He was the foremost member of the family of artists by that name active in Saxony during the 16th century. Lucas Cranach adopted his surname from his birthplace, Kronach, a town of Upper Franconia in the diocese of Bamberg. His father and teacher was a painter by the name of Hans Moller or Maler (1448–1491/2). None of his work is known to survive, but his large house in Kronach on the Marktplatz suggests that he was successful. The name Maler ('Painter') has led to some uncertainty as to whether it was simply a reference to Hans's profession, but contemporary references to 'pictor Lucas Moller' or 'maler Moller' confirm that it had become the family surname. The still repeated belief that the name was Sonder or Sunder apparently results from a confusion with another family in Kronach, which was related to Lucas the Elder through marriage.

"
1253,"CRANACH, Lucas the Younger","(b. 1515, Wittenberg, d.1586, Weimar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cranach/lucas_y/biograph.html,"
German painter and designer of woodcuts, son of Lucas Cranach the Elder. His work was so closely modelled on that of his father that distinguishing the late style of Lucas the Elder from the early works of his son remains in most cases hypothetical. Having first been his father’s pupil and assistant, he remained in the workshop his entire career. His responsibilities increased over the 1530s, especially after the death of his older brother Hans in 1537. Lucas the Younger became the de facto head of the workshop in 1550, when his father left Wittenberg to join the deposed Saxon elector John Frederick in Augsburg. On his father’s death in 1553, he became sole proprietor and chief artist of this family enterprise.

Flemish painter and draughtsman. He was active in the southern Netherlands at the time when demand was high for decorative schemes embodying the tenets of the Counter-Reformation: altarpieces and other religious paintings form the largest part of his considerable oeuvre. To a significant extent he owes his reputation to the fact that he was one of the earliest and most consistent followers of Rubens, whose formal idiom he disseminated beyond Antwerp's artistic circles."

The family played a prominent part in the life of Rome from the 10th century, if not earlier, and by the 17th century were regarded as one of the oldest and most illustrious of the city's patrician families. Under the leadership of Virgilio Crescenzi (d. 1592) and his sons Giacomo Crescenzi (c. 1570-1638), Pietro Paolo Crescenzi, Giovanni Battista Crescenzi and Francesco Crescenzi, the family, which supported Filippo Neri, the founder of the Oratorians, was distinguished both for its dedication to the work of reform within the Church and for its interests in the arts. Cristoforo Roncalli ran an academy at the Palazzo Crescenzi, at which the Crescenzi brothers, among others, studied."

Milanese painter. Although he died young of the plague, his output was large and his work is considered to be one of the most typical expressions of the zealous spirit of the Counter-Reformation that affected Milan at this time. St Charles Borromeo at Supper in Sta Maria della Passione is his best-known work and in its simple composition and emotional directness reflects the ideals of painting advocated by the Council of Trent. Many other examples of his work are in the church. He was probably a relative of Giovanni Battista Crespi, whose work influenced him.

His nickname derived from his birthplace near Novara, but he was mainly active in Milan, where he was one of the leading artists of his time. During the 1590s he was in Rome, where he was befriended by Cardinal Federico Borromeo (nephew of St Charles Borromeo), who became his major patron after they returned to Milan together. Borromeo appointed him head of the painting section of the Accademia Ambrosiana, which he founded in 1620, and in 1629 put him in charge of the sculptural decoration of Milan Cathedral.

Italian painter and draughtsman. His individual and poetic art represents, with that of Marcantonio Franceschini, the last significant expression of the classical-idealist strain in Bolognese painting. His activity was almost wholly confined to Bologna, where he painted decorative frescoes, altarpieces and easel pictures for private collectors. Two qualities are paramount: a perfected finesse of handling and poetic suggestiveness of situation and mood. He sought the ideal beauty of the individual figure and was thus at his best in meditative pictures with few figures; his subjects combine grace of form and precision of contour with flesh that attains the surface delicacy of porcelain and colours that have a mineral-like refulgence. He was a prolific draughtsman with a distinct personal manner, who drew for pleasure as well as to prepare his compositions, usually using a quill-pen and producing shadowing by hatching."

In or about 1567 he was apprenticed to the Flemish Mannerist painter Lucas de Heere (c. 1534-c. 1584), then resident in England. De Critz stayed with him for at least four years; it was probably de Heere who introduced him to the statesman Sir Francis Walsingham (?1530-1590), for whom he worked in Paris (and perhaps in Italy) on at least six occasions (1582-88). He supplied his patron with several works by his own hand and perhaps by others. It may be inferred from his training and from his trips to France that de Critz was fully aware of European Mannerism and the school of Fontainebleau. Thus it may well be that his was the driving force behind the development in England of the exotic, courtly and highly mannered Elizabethan portrait style."
1267,"CRIVELLI, Carlo","(b. 1430/35, Venezia, d. 1495, Camerino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crivelli/carlo/biograph.html,"

Italian painter. He was born in Venice and always signed himself as a Venetian, but he spent most of his career working in the Marches, particularly at Ascoli Piceno, and he also lived for some time at Zara in Dalmatia (now Croatia). His paintings are all of religious subjects, done in a n elaborate, old-fashioned style that owes much to the wiry Paduan tradition of Squarcione and Mantegna and yet is highly distinctive. Their dense ornamentation is often increased by the use of gesso decoration combined with the paint. The finest collection of his works is in the National Gallery in London and includes the delightful and much reproduced Annunciation (1486).

"
1268,"CRIVELLI, Vittore","(b. ca. 1440, Venezia, d. 1501/2, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crivelli/vittore/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Carlo Crivelli. Like Carlo, Vittore always signed himself as a Venetian. He followed his brother to Zara, where he is documented from 1465. He probably spent some time in Carlo's workshop, although there is only one surviving collaborative work, a polyptych for the church of S Martino at Montesanmartino (in situ). In 1469 Vittore took on a pupil in Zara whom he agreed to train for eight years. In 1476 he bought a house there."
1269,"CRIVELLI, Taddeo","(active 1451, d. ca. 1479, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crivellt/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and painter (also Taddeo da Ferrara). Bertoni hypothesized a Lombard origin for the artist on orthographic grounds, and Crivelli's style seems to support this, although at least 20 years of his working life were spent in Ferrara. The earliest surviving document concerning Crivelli is his personal account book for 1451-57 (Modena, Archivio Storico). It is calculated that during this period Crivelli was engaged in more than 100 projects. In carrying out these commissions, he employed a sizeable shop of apprentices and assistants, including Cristoforo Mainardi (fl 1454) and Jacopo Filippo d'Argenta. In 1452 Crivelli contracted to illuminate 'uno trato sopra lo evangelio di san zoane che fe santo agostino' for Novello Malatesta. This has been identified with a copy of St Augustine's Sermons on the Gospel of St John (Cesena, Biblioteca Malatestiana)."
1270,"CRIVELLI, Angelo Maria",(d. ca. 1730),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crivellx/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Crivellone. He was the most important specialist in scenes with hunting, game, wild and domestic birds, animals, poultry and fish, active in Lombardy at the turn of the eighteenth century. For his vast and varied production - very popular among the petite noblesse and wealthy bourgeoisie of Milan - his points of reference were local painters such as Angelo Maria Rossi as well as northern European  artists of the caliber of Frans Snyders, Jan Fyt, Pieter Boel and Melchior d'Hondecoeter. His son Giovanni, called Crivellino (d. 1760), followed his father's footsteps and developed his themes, interpreting them in a more markedly decorative light, creating various cycles of large canvases designed to adorn the lavish salons of country villas."
1271,"CROFF, Giuseppe","(b. 1810, Milano, d. 1869, Torno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/croff/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. Little is known about his life. He lived and worked in Milan, but evidence suggests that he had also an active artistic career near Lake Como, in Italy's lake region."
1272,"CROME, John","(b. 1768, Norwich, d. 1821, Norwich)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crome/biograph.html,"
English painter, printmaker and collector, active in the city of Norwich. The son of a journeyman weaver, he was apprenticed to a coach and sign painter, Francis Whisler, from 1783 to 1790. He presumably continued in this trade and during the 1790s consolidated his artistic training."
1273,CRONACA,"(b. 1457, Firenze, d. 1508, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cronaca/biograph.html,"
Il Cronaca, byname of Simone del Pollaiuolo, Italian architect and stonemason, not related to Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo. According to Vasari, it was his accurate accounts of the marvels of Rome, where he studied, that earned him the nickname of 'Il Cronaca' ('The Chronicler'). In 1480 he returned to Florence, where he designed the courtyard and monumental cornice of the Strozzi Palace, the cornice reflecting his study of Roman architecture. He collaborated with Giuliano da Sangallo on a number of projects, including the Sacristy of Santo Spirito, the Casa Horne and the Palazzo Strozzi. The aisleless church of San Francesco al Monte, with its simple pietra serena articulation, shows his understanding of Classical architecture which he studied in Rome (1475-85), and is also related to the drawings and measurements he took from early Romanesque buildings in Florence, such as the Baptistery, which were thought in the Renaissance to be antique structures."
1274,"CROOS, Anthonie Jansz. van der","(b. ca. 1606, Alkmaar, d. ca. 1663, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/croos/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Though born and raised in Alkmaar, from 1632 on Croos lived and worked mostly in The Hague. He became member of the Guild of St. Luke in The Hague in 1647 and in Alkmaar in 1649. In The Hague he was co-founder of the Confrérie Pictura in 1656."
1275,"CROPSEY, Jasper Francis","(b. 1823, Rossville, d. 1900, Hastings-on-Hudson)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cropsey/biograph.html,"
American painter and architect. He was a practicing architect by 1843, but in that year he also exhibited a landscape painting, to favourable reviews, at the National Academy of Design, in New York. He greatly admired Thomas Cole for his dramatic use of the American landscape, but Cropsey brought to his panoramic vistas a more precise recording of nature."
1276,"CROSATO, Giovanni Battista","(b. ca. 1685, Treviso, d. 1758, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/crosato/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and stage designer. His earliest known work, the Flagellation of Christ (c. 1706; Venice, Museo Diocesano S Apollinia), for the Scuola del Cristo of S Marcuola, is a dark, shadowy painting that reveals the strong influence of tenebrist trends of the 17th century. Crosato, however, belonged to the generation of Venetian painters such as Jacopo Amigoni, Sebastiano Ricci and Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, who were developing a lighter, more colourful style. His tonality changed from the darkened shadows of the Flagellation to the light-filled frescoes for Stupinigi, the hunting palace of the Duke of Savoy, near Turin, which constitute his next known work. The most successful of these, the Sacrifice of Iphigenia (begun 1733), on the vault of the antechamber of the queen's apartment, is a highly dramatic work full of bright bold colours accentuated against the blue sky and white clouds. The gold, blue and red tones are effectively placed so as to lead the eye around the room and guide it through the narrative, which is related through the specific gestures or glances of a few figures, at the same time suggesting the idea of greater numbers. Equally direct is Crosato's use of sharply defined, highly saturated colours, which remain constant in their intensity and effective in providing visual unity; his linear style defines solidly modelled forms. Other rooms at Stupinigi decorated by him included the antechapel of S Umberto, with figures of hunters and lady companions, and the Sala degli Scudiere, with the story of Apollo and the Python on the ceiling. These works established Crosato's career in Savoy. He received further commissions for fresco cycles in the vestibule of the Villa Regina and in the Palazzo Reale in Turin."
1277,"CROSS, Henri-Edmond","(b. 1856, Douai, d. 1910, Saint-Clair)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cross/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. Born Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix, the only surviving child of Alcide Delacroix, a French adventurer and failed businessman, and the British-born Fanny Woollett, he changed his name in 1881, shortening and Anglicizing his birth name to Henri Cross. Later, in 1886, he adopted the name Henri-Edmond Cross."
1278,"CRUIKSHANK, George","(b. 1792, London, d. 1878, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cruiksha/biograph.html,"
English printmaker and draftsman, an artist famous for his political cartoons and prolific book illustrations. In his later career he made moral narratives in woodcut, especially in regards to the temperance movement. Cruikshank was also an actor."
1279,"CRUQUIUS, Nicolaas Samuel","(b. 1678, Vlieland, d. 1754, Spaarndam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cruquius/biograph.html,"
Nicolaas Samuel Cruquius (Kruikius), Dutch hydraulic engineer, land surveyor and amateur landscape painter. His original name was Nicolaas Kruik, but, like many well-educated men of his time, he Latinized his name to Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius. He was one of many promoters of a plan to pump the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem lake) dry.



"
1280,"CRUYL, Lieven","(b. ca. 1640, Gent, d. ca. 1720, Gent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cruyl/biograph.html,"
Flemish printmaker and architect. He studied theology, architecture, drawing and etching in Leuven. He was a priest in Wetteren near Ghent from 1660 to 1664. He was involved as an architect in the completion of the Saint Michael's Church, Ghent, the construction of which had been interrupted because of the iconoclastic troubles of the 16th century. He made a design for the unfinished western tower in a Brabantine Gothic style in 1662. The design was finally not implemented due to cost concerns."
1281,"CRUZ, Diego de la",(documented 1482-1500 in Burgos),https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cruz/biograph.html,"
Diego de la Cruz was a Spanish painter, probably of Flemish origin. He collaborated with the sculptor Gil de Siloé in polychromating various Castilian retables. Stylistically he belongs to the Hispano-Flemish school.



"
1282,"CSONTVÁRY KOSZTKA, Tivadar","(b. 1853, Kisszeben, d. 1919, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/csontvar/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. Although he died at the age of sixty, his creative period was very short. He started his art studies in 1894; he painted his major pictures between 1903 and 1909. His oeuvre consists of about one hundred paintings and twenty drawings - not too many, but his paintings were the first great summary of modern art in Hungary. Csontváry's decision to become a painter was influenced by his schizophrenia. He worked for fourteen years in order to become financially independent, and started to study painting at the age of forty-one: first in Munich under Simon Hollósy, then in Karlsruhe under Kallmorgen."
1283,"CUGNOT, Louis-Léon","(b. 1835, Paris, d. 1894, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cugnot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He obtained the Prix of Rome in 1859, jointly with Alexandre Falguière. He was resident of the Villa Médicis in Rome from 1860 to 1863.



"
1284,"CUIRIS, Juan Bautista","(active 1590s in Michoacán, Mexico)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuiris/biograph.html,"
Spanish artist, active in Mexico in the early colonial period when the pre-Hispanic art of feather painting flourished. He worked at one of the trade schools attached to the region's Augustinian monasteries under the auspices of Bishop Vasco de Quiroga (1470-1565). No biographical data are known about the artist.



"
1285,"CULLEN, Maurice Galbraith","(b. 1866, St. John's, Newfoundland, d. 1934, Chambly)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cullen/biograph.html,"
Canadian painter. In 1870 he moved with his family to Montreal, which became his principal home. After taking drawing lessons in local art schools and studying sculpture with Louis-Philippe Hébert (1850-1917) from 1884 to 1887, he went in 1888 to study in Paris. He was elected an associate of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1895."
1286,"CURRADI, Francesco","(b. 1570, Firenze, d. 1661, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/curradi/biograph.html,"

Italian painter, part of a family of artists, son of Taddeo Curradi (1529-1596), a sculptor. He produced many devotional works and had a large clientele. At their best, the works are distinguished by lucid draughtsmanship, simple compositions and elegant, melancholy figures.

"
1287,"CUSTODIS, Hieronymos","(d. ca. 1593, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/custodis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England. Born in Antwerp, he probably went to England because of religious persecution, perhaps soon after the surrender of Antwerp to the Duque de Alba in 1585. Three signed and dated portraits survive, all painted in 1589, among them those of Sir Giles Brydges, 3rd Lord Chandos, and his 14-year-old daughter Elizabeth Brydges, later Lady Kennedy (both Woburn Abbey, Beds). The elaboration of the dress, the cool colours and the meticulous delineation of jewellery are reminiscent of the work of Nicholas Hilliard, and Custodis also seems to owe something to the English portrait painter George Gower."
1288,"CUVILLIÉS, François de, the Elder","(b. 1695, Soignies, Hainaut, d. 1768, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuvillie/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer of Flemish origin, active in Germany. Cuvilliés was so diminutive in stature that it was as a court dwarf he first came to the notice of the currently exiled Max Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, who detected the young dwarf's aptitude and had him tutored in mathematics, then underwrote his further education with Joseph Effner (1687-1745) and sent him to Paris, 1720-24, where he trained in the atelier of Jean-François Blondel (1681-1756). On his return to Munich he was appointed court architect, at first in conjunction with Effner."
1289,"CUYCK VAN MYEROP, Frans","(b. ca. 1640, Brugge, d. 1689, Gent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuyck/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Ghent. His subjects were still-lifes (fruit and fish pieces), game pieces and trompe-l'oeil paintings. In 1665 he joined the painters' guild, where he was dean from 1679 to 1685.



"
1290,"CUYLENBORCH, Abraham van","(b. ca. 1610, Utrecht, d. 1658, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuylenbo/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He completed his early training in Utrecht in the studio of the leading Dutch Italianate painter of his day, Cornelis van Poelenburgh. The highly successful style of Poelenburgh was to exert an influence on the young Cuylenborch which was to remain with him throughout his career. He is recorded being made an independent master of the Guild of Saint Luke in Utrecht in 1639. 



"
1291,"CUYP, Aelbert","(b. 1620, Dordrecht, d. 1691, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuyp/aelbert/biograph.html,"

1293,"CUYP, Jacob Gerritsz.","(b. 1594, Dordrecht, d. ca. 1651, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/c/cuyp/jacob/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman, the son of a glass painter and a pupil of Abraham Bloemaert at Utrecht. He entered the Guild of St Luke in Dordrecht in 1617, the same year that he executed an important commission to portray the masters of the Holland Mint (Dordrecht, Museum van Gijn). He was the Guild's bookkeeper in 1629, 1633, 1637 and 1641 and, according to Houbraken, led Dordrecht's fine painters in their separation from the Guild in 1642. Jacob married Aertken van Cooten from Utrecht in 1618; his only child, Aelbert Cuyp, was born two years later."
1294,"D'OISY, Jean","(b. 1310, Valenciennes, d. 1377, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/d_oisy/biograph.html,"
French architect. He lived in the Duchy of Brabant and worked in the Brabantian style. He is noted for parts of the St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen (from 1335, 1342-1375).



"
1295,"D'ORBAY, François II","(b. 1634, Paris, d. 1697, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/d_orbay/biograph.html,"
French architect and printmaker, who worked closely with Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart. He was the son of François I d'Orbay, (died 1677), a mason."
1296,"D'ORSI, Achille","(b. 1845, Napoli, d. 1929, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/d_orsi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. The son of a small landowner, in 1857 he entered the Regio Istituto di Belle Arti in Naples, where he studied under the guidance of the sculptor Tito Angelini (1806-1878). He first exhibited in 1863, with the terracotta Wounded Soldier of Garibaldi (Naples, Capodimonte), a work inspired by Garibaldi's campaign against the Bourbon rulers of Naples. D'Orsi's main interest, however, was in subjects from everyday life, and this allied him to the contemporary artistic and literary current of Verismo. Among his works of this kind were his plaster statue of A Fisherman (1864; untraced) and the Old Woman at the Grave (terracotta, 1876; Naples, Accademia di Belle Arti), which have affinities with sculptures by his principal rival, Vincenzo Gemito."
1297,"DADDI, Bernardo","(b. ca. 1280, Firenze, d. 1348, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daddi/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter, the outstanding painter in Florence in the period after the death of Giotto (who was possibly his teacher). Daddi ran a busy workshop specializing in small devotional panels and portable altarpieces. His signed and dated works include a polyptych of The Crucifixion with Eight Saints (Courtauld Institute, London, 1348) and the works attributed to him include frescos of the Martyrdoms of SS. Lawrence and Stephen in Santa Croce. His style is a sweetened version of Giotto's, tempering the latter's gravity with Sienese grace and lightness. He favoured smiling Madonnas, teasing children, and an abundance of flowers and trailing draperies. His lyrical manner was extremely popular and his influence endured into the second half of the century.

1299,"DAFFINGER, Moritz Michael","(b. 1790, Wien, d. 1849, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daffinge/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. His father, Johann Daffinger (d. 1796), was a painter at the Kaiserliche Porzellanmanufaktur in Vienna and, at the age of 11, Daffinger was apprenticed there to his stepfather Philipp Krug and to Michael Weixlbaum. Daffinger studied and worked at the factory until 1812, also attending classes at the Akademie in Vienna under Hubert Maurer (1738-1818) and Heinrich Füger."
1300,"DAGNAN-BOUVERET, Pascal-Adolphe-Jean","(b. 1852, Paris, d. 1929, Quincey)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dagnan/biograph.html,"
French painter. He refused to leave France when his father Bernard Dagnan moved to Brazil in 1868, and he remained with his maternal grandfather in Melun (nr Paris). Later he added the maternal surname Bouveret to his own in gratitude for his grandfather's support, which enabled him to study in Paris."
1301,"DAHL, Johan Christian Clausen","(b. 1788, Bergen, d. 1857, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dahl/biograph.html,"
Norwegian painter, often called the discoverer of the Norwegian landscape. From 1824 until his death he was a professor at the Academy of Dresden, where he was a friend of Friedrich. The landscapes of Ruisdael were another influence on his Romantic outlook. Through his deep feeling for the grandeur of the landscape of his native country he was a pioneer of the new spirit of nationalism that characterized much Norwegian art in the 19th century.



"
1302,"DAHL, Michael","(b. ca. 1659, Stockholm, d. 1743, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dahl_m/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter, active in England. He studied under Martin Hannibal (d. 1741) and later with David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl. In 1682 he travelled to London, where he became acquainted with Godfrey Kneller and Henry Tilson, and in 1685 he left for Europe with the latter, working briefly in Paris before proceeding to Venice and Rome, where they stayed for about two years. In Rome Dahl converted to Roman Catholicism and gravitated towards the circle of Christina, former Queen of Sweden, who sat for him (Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincs)."
1303,"DAL ZOTTO, Antonio","(b. 1841, Venezia, d. 1918, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dal_zott/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti, then moved to Rome  to study with Pietro Tenerani. In 1864, the young artist received the commission for the funeral monument of the Giulay family. In the same year he won the Grand Prix of Rome. From 1870 he is professor of anatomy at the Scuola Veneta d'Arte, and from 1879 professor at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice."
1304,"DALEM, Cornelis van","(b. ca. 1530, Antwerpen, d. 1573, Breda)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalem/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of a cloth merchant living in Antwerp, but of Dutch origin. According to van Mander, Cornelis was learned in poetry and history and only painted as an amateur, not for a living. Documents in the Antwerp archives invariably refer to him as a merchant, never as a painter, which no doubt accounts for the small number of known paintings by him. In 1545 he was apprenticed to Jan Adriaensen and in 1556 became a free master of the Antwerp guild. In the same year he married Beatrix van Liedekercke, a member of an Antwerp patrician family. They lived in Antwerp until late 1565, when, apparently for religious reasons, they left for Breda, together with the artist’s mother, who had become a widow in 1561. In 1571 van Dalem, who was then living in a small castle near Breda, was accused of heresy.

Between 1560 and 1564 Bartholomeus Spranger was his pupil."
1305,"DALEN, Cornelis van, the Elder","(b. ca. 1602, Amsterdam, d. 1665, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalen/biograph.html,"
Cornelis van Dalen was a Dutch engraver. He was in England in 1631-1642. His more gifted son Cornelis van Dalen II was emigrated to England and died there. Cornelis van Dalen II was an artist of considerable stature, who engraved some of the most powerful portraits of his time.

Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, specialised in landscapes. He was the son and pupil of Willem Dalens (1628-1675), and the grandson of Dirck Dalens I, both of whom were landscape painters in Haarlem and Dordrecht and, later, in Amsterdam. His son was Dirck Dalens III."
1308,"DALENS, Dirck III","(b. 1688, Amsterdam, d. 1753, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalens/dirck3/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, specialised in landscapes. He was the son of Dirck Dalens II. He was born in 1688 after the death of his father, and continued the family's 150-year tradition of landscape painting into the fourth generation. He died in 1753, sixty-five years after the death of his father."
1309,"DALLE MASEGNE, Jacobello","(d. 1409, active in Emilia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalle_ma/biograph.html,"
Italian family of sculptors and architects. Jacobello [Giacomello; Jacobellus; Jacomelo] dalle Masegne (active from 1383; d. after 1409) and his brother Pierpaolo dalle Masegne (active from 1383; d. c. 1403) were the sons of Antonio dalle Masegne, a stonemason in Venice. They usually undertook and signed their major commissions together, as was the common practice in Venice for family partnerships. However, although there is no documentary evidence to prove it, it is possible to recognize their individual styles in separate sections of their collaborative works.



"
1310,"DALMATA, Giovanni","(b. 1440, Trau, d. 1510, Trau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalmata/biograph.html,"
Dalmatian sculptor, active in Italy and Hungary. He probably trained as a mason in a local workshop near Trogir (Trau). He moved to Rome in the 1460s, by which time his style was fully developed. Initially he may have worked with Paolo Romano. His earliest works include the side portal of the Palazzo Venezia, Rome, built for Cardinal Pietro Barbo (later Pope Paul II), and the lunette and other sculptures on the façade of the tempietto at Vicovaro. In 1469 he carved the Annunciation and statues of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist on the altar of the Madonna della Palla in San Giovanni at Norcia (Umbria)."
1311,"DALMAU, Luis",(active 1428-61),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalmau/biograph.html,"
Catalan painter, born and active mainly in Valencia. He was court painter to Alfonso V of Aragon, under whose patronage he went to Bruges in 1431 to study tapestry weaving. Dalmau's visit to Flanders is the first recorded contact of a Spanish painter with the Netherlandish school, and the only surviving  painting certainly by him, the Virgin of the Councillors is clearly inspired by Van Eyck.


"
1312,"DALOU, Jules","(b. 1838, Paris, d. 1902, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalou/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, popular under the Third Republic. He was associated with the naturalistic movement in French sculpture and often influenced by the Baroque."
1313,"DALSGAARD, Christen","(b. 1824, Skive, Jutland, d. 1907, Sorø)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dalsgaar/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He began his art studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen in 1841. In the same year he began private studies with painter Martinus Rørbye. These lessons continued until 1847. In 1843 he began his studies at the Academy's freehand drawing school, and the following year at the Academy's plaster school. Home during the summer and holidays, he busied himself by filling sketchbooks with studies of the local landscape, costumes and way of life. These formed a lifelong basis for his art. He also began collecting local folk costumes, another lifelong interest."
1314,"DAMMARTIN, Guy de",(died 1398),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dammarti/biograph.html,"
French architect and sculptor. He was one of the first architects in France at the service of the princes of the royal family to adopt the new style, in the 1380s: the Sainte-Chapelle de Riom and the Maubergeon tower of the Palais de Poitiers. He was the court master mason of Duke Jean de Berry, one of the king's uncles, who had residences in Bourges, Riom, Mehun-sur-Yèvre, and Poitiers, furnished in a princely manner. He entered the service of the Duke de Berry shortly before 1370, and in Poitiers at the end of the 1380s he restored the Early Gothic palace of the duke's forebears, the dukes of Aquitaine."
1315,"DANBY, Francis","(b. 1793, Killinick, d. 1861, Exmouth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/danby/biograph.html,"
Irish painter. He was a landowner's son and studied art at the Dublin Society. In 1813 he visited London, then worked in Bristol, initially on repetitious watercolours of local scenes: for example, View of Hotwells, the Avon Gorge (c. 1818; Bristol, Museum and Art Gallery). Around 1819 he entered the cultivated circle of George Cumberland (1754-1849) and the Rev. John Eagles (1783-1855). Danby's discovery of the 'poetry of nature' in local scenery and insignificant incident was influenced by the theories of Eagles, published as The Sketcher (1856), and, less directly, by those of William Wordsworth, who had been associated with Bristol earlier in the century."
1316,"DANCE-HOLLAND, Nathaniel","(b. 1735, London, d. 1811, Winchester)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dance/biograph.html,"
English painter and legislator. He was the third son of architect George Dance the Elder (1700-1768). Dance (he added the 'Holland' suffix later in life) studied art under Francis Hayman, and like many contemporaries also studied in Italy. There he met Angelica Kauffmann, and painted several historic and classical paintings. Dance remained in Rome for a decade, returning to London in 1765, having received further training from Pompeo Batoni."

His patrons in the 1720s included Capt. Richard Gifford, of whom he painted a small equestrian portrait (c. 1725; London, National Army Museum). In 1731 he took over Kneller's former studio and began painting large-scale portraits. His developing French style earned him the patronage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, as evidenced by a small portrait (c. 1732; London, National Portrait Gallery)."

Painter and designer, part of an Austrian family of artists, son of Josef Ulrich Danhauser, a furniture manufacturer. He was first taught drawing by his father and then studied history painting at the Vienna Akademie (1820-26). On leaving the Akademie he took up an invitation from his patron, the Archbishop of Eger in Hungary, László Pyrker, to visit Venice; he spent five months there and paid particular attention to the work of the Old Masters. When he returned to Vienna, Danhauser was under great pressure from his family to become more involved in the running of the furniture factory, but Pyrker invited him to Eger with a commission to paint a number of portraits and to restore paintings in the gallery of the Archbishop's Palace."

Daniele da Volterra (originally Daniele Ricciarelli), Italian painter, stuccoist and sculptor. He was called Volterra from the place of his birth. As a boy, he entered the studios of Bazzi (Il Sodoma) and of Baldassare Peruzzi at Siena, but he was not well received and left for Rome, where he found his earliest employment. He formed a friendship with Michelangelo, who assisted him with commissions, and with ideas and suggestions, especially for his series of paintings in one of the chapels of the Trinità dei Monti. By an excess of praise, his greatest picture, the Descent from the Cross, was at one time grouped with the Transfiguration of Raphael and the Last Communion of Domenichino, as the most famous pictures in Rome. His principal work was the Massacre of the Innocents, which he painted for the Church of St. Peter at Volterra now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence."
1325,"DANIELS, Andries",(active 1599-1640 in Flanders),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daniels/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of flower still-lifes who played an important role in the development of the genre of garland paintings in Antwerp. Little is known about his life. In 1599 he is registered at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of Pieter Brueghel the Younger. He may have participated in copying works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder during his period of apprenticeship. In 1602 he was registered as a master of the Guild."

French painter and draftsman. Orphaned at an early age, Henri-Pierre Danloux was raised by his uncle, an architect. Around 1770 he studied under a genre painter and a history painter. He followed one of them to Rome in 1775 and then traveled throughout Italy. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Danloux preferred drawing the Roman countryside and portraits instead of ancient monuments."
1327,"DANNECKER, Heinrich","(b. 1758, Stuttgart, d. 1841, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dannecke/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and collector. He received his initial artistic training (1771-80) at the Militärische Pflanzschule in Stuttgart, where he revealed a talent for drawing and sculpture. His most important tutors were the Belgian sculptor Pierre François Lejeune (1721-90) and the French painter Nicolas Guipal, an admirer of Mengs. Also of great importance to Dannecker were friendships with his fellow sculptor and rival Philipp Jakob Scheffauer (1756-1808), with the painter Philipp Friedrich Hetsch, and above all with the German writer Friedrich Schiller, who had a decisive influence on Dannecker's intellectual development."

Italian sculptor, architect and writer, part of a family of artists, scientists and writers. The members of the Danti family (originally the Rainaldi: the name was changed out of admiration for Dante Alighieri) are said to have pursued artistic and literary careers over several generations. Vincenzio Danti was a leading Florentine Mannerist sculptor, and one of the most distinguished sculptors in 16th-century Italy. He also wrote a celebrated treatise on proportion."
1330,"DARET, Jacques","(b. ca. 1404, Tournai, d. 1470)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daret/biograph.html,"

Jacques Daret was Netherlandish painter born at Tournai in around 1403, and, save for a few brief interludes, spent the rest of his life in the city of his birth. He was trained along with Rogelet de la Pature (assumed to be identical with Rogier van der Weyden) in Robert Campin's studio, where he spent fifteen years or so, before setting up as a master in his own right. Without being a genius in the strict sense of the term, he was yet an excellent artist with a thorough grasp of the techniques of his trade. In many ways, he was quite the equal of his more famous contemporaries, and was above all a supremely talented draughtsman. He was one of the stars of the Burgundian court, and was twice chosen in preference to all competitors when Philip the Good and Charles the Bold were looking for someone to organize a ceremonial occasion. His principal patron over a period of twenty years was the abbot of St Vaart, Jean de Clercq.

At an early age he copied works by Ruisdael and Poussin in the Louvre, while also pursuing an apprenticeship as an engraver. At this time he drew and painted mainly at Saint-Cloud and Clamart, near Paris, and in the Forest of Fontainebleau (1834-35). He went to Italy in 1835. He returned to Paris in 1836 and worked for François-Marius Granet in the painting restoration department of the Louvre."

1334,"DAUCHER, Adolf","(b. 1460, Wien, d. 1523, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daucher/adolf/biograph.html,"
Adolf Daucher the Elder, German sculptor, possibly the son of Bartholomäus Dauher (active 1476-1495 in Augsburg). Adolf probably worked in Ulm with the sculptor Michael Erhart, whose daughter Afra he married sometime prior to 1485. Their eight children included the sculptor Adolf Daucher the Younger (c. 1485-1557), who carved the choir-stalls (1550) and pulpit (1551) in the minster Schwäbisch-Gmünd, Hans Daucher and three other sons who were artists. In 1490 Adolf and his family moved to Augsburg, where he served initially as the manager of the property owned by the Cistercian monastery at Kaisheim. On 30 July 1491 he obtained Augsburg citizenship.



"
1335,"DAUCHER, Hans","(b. ca. 1485, Ulm, d. ca. 1538, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daucher/hans/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, son of Adolf Daucher. He was the finest sculptor in Augsburg during the 1520s. From October 1500 he resided with his uncle and teacher Gregor Erhart and probably travelled to Venice and northern Italy sometime prior to 1514, when he obtained Augsburg citizenship, married Susanna Spitzmacher and became a master sculptor. He is first mentioned in the city's tax records in 1516, at which time he was living in his father's house. Hans and Adolf probably shared a workshop until 1522, although Hans registered his first pupils in 1518 and 1521. During Easter week 1528, while Hans was in Vienna, the Augsburg officials raided his house and arrested Susanna and about 100 others during an Anabaptist celebration. Her subsequent fate is unknown, although approximately 100 Anabaptists left Augsburg for Strasbourg by 1529. It seems likely that she and the others were banished."

1337,"DAUMIER, Honoré","(b. 1808, Marseille, d. 1879, Valmondois)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/daumier/biograph.html,"
French caricaturist, painter, and sculptor. In his lifetime he was known chiefly as a political and social satirist, but since his death recognition of his qualities as a painter has grown. In 1830, after learning the still fairly new process of lithography, he began to contribute political cartoons to the antigovernment weekly Caricature. He was an ardent Republican and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in 1832 for his attacks on Louis-Philippe, whom he represented as 'Gargantua swallowing bags of gold extorted from the people'. On the suppression of political satire in 1835 he began to work for Charivari and turned to satire of social life, but at the time of the 1848 revolution he returned to political subjects. He is said to have made more than 4,000 lithographs, wishing each time that the one he had just made could be his last. In the last years of his life he was almost blind and was saved from destitution by Corot.

German architect and etcher who specialised in the Neoclassical style. He was born in Leipzig and educated by Adam Friedrich Oeser (1717-1799). In his hometown, where he had been the city's construction official most of his buildings have been built, such as the first concert chamber of the Gewandhaus (1781), the square now known as the Augustusplatz (1785) and the interior of the St. Nicholas Church (1794).

1341,"DAVENT, Léon",(active 1540-1556),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/davent/biograph.html,"
French engraver. Very little is known about his life and career. Only one of his engravings, the Apostles Contemplating Christ and the Virgin (1546) after Giulio Romano, bears a full name, 'Lion Daven'; all the others have merely the monogram 'L.D.', under which his work is usually catalogued (Master LD). Until Herbet's study, this monogram was taken to be the signature of the Fleming Léonard Thiry. Davent made engravings from 1540, turning to etching c. 1543-44. 221 plates are attributed to him.

1343,DAVID d'Angers,"(b. 1788, Angers, d. 1856, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/david_a/biograph.html,"
French sculptor (original name Pierre-Jean David) called after his birthplace to distinguish him from the painter Jacques-Louis David. The son of a sculptor, he won the Prix de Rome in 1811 and was in Rome until 1816, when he returned to France via London, in order to see the Elgin marbles (which had just been bought for the British Museum) and to meet Flaxman, to whom he carried a letter of introduction from Canova. Canova was the main influence on him and his rather chilly classicism is redeemed by his great technical skill. His Bourcke and Foy monuments (1821 and 1825, both in Pere Lachaise cemetery, Paris), the bloodless Racine (1827, La Ferté Milon, Racine's birthplace), and the bombastic Philipoemen (1837, Louvre) are examples of the Pompier (pompous) style, against which younger painters (though not sculptors) were already rebelling."
1344,"DAVID, Jacques-Louis","(b. 1748, Paris, d. 1825, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/david_j/biograph.html,"
French painter, one of the central figures of Neoclassicism. He had his first training with Boucher, a distant relative, but Boucher realized that their temperaments were opposed and sent David to Vien. David went to Italy with the latter in 1776, Vien having been appointed director of the French Academy at Rome, David having won the Prix de Rome. In Italy David was able to indulge his bent for the antique and came into contact with the initiators of the new classical revival, including Gavin Hamilton. In 1780 he returned to Paris, and in the 1780s his position was firmly established as the embodiment of the social and moral reaction from the frivolity of the Rococo. His uncompromising subordination of colour to drawing and his economy of statement were in keeping with the new severity of taste. His themes gave expression to the new cult of the civic virtues of stoical self-sacrifice, devotion to duty, honesty, and austerity. Seldom have paintings so completely typified the sentiment of an age as David's The Oath of the Horatii (Louvre, Paris, 1784), Brutus and his Dead Sons (Louvre, 1789), and The Death of Socrates (Metropolitan Museum, New York, 1787). They were received with acclamation by critics and public alike. Reynolds compared the Socrates with Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's Stanze, and after ten visits to the Salon described it as 'in every sense perfect'."
1345,"DAVID, Jérôme","(b. ca. 1605, Paris, d. ca. 1670, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/david_je/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He produced a considerable number of plates many of which are portraits. He is noted for having engraved works by Giovanni Battista Montano (1534-1621). His plates are executed with the graver in a clear firm manner. His brother Charles David (c. 1600-c. 1636) was also engraver, the brothers worked in the same style.



"
1346,"DAVID, Ludovico Antonio","(b. 1648, Lugano, d. after 1709)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/david_la/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and theorist. He went to Milan about 1665 to study painting under Francesco Cairo. A decade later he moved to Venice, where for the Lombard chapel of Santa Maria dei Frari he painted St Carlo Borromeo Distributing Alms to the Poor (in situ) in the dark, dramatic, fully Baroque manner of his teacher. David's other documented works in Venice are in Santa Maria del Carmelo and the Palazzo Albizzi a Sant'Aponal. While in Venice he also operated a highly successful art academy, remarkably, in competition with Pietro della Vecchia, a far more successful painter. Contemporary reports indicate that 'he contradicted della Vecchia at every turn', and that he played down the importance of drawing, making it secondary to the painter's own ideas. This attitude was highly radical, given that drawing was then considered the basis of an artist's education."
1347,"DAVIS, Richard Barrett","(b. 1782, Watford, d. 1854, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/davis/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was appointed animal painter to George IV from 1828, and had had close associations with the Royal Household for a number of years before. Davis' father, Richard Davis (1750-1825), had been huntsman to George III's private harriers from 1789, and when the hunt moved to Windsor at the turn of the century the young artist's talents caught the attention of the King. As early as 1805 he exhibited a painting of His Majesty in his Travelling Chariot Returning to Town from Windsor at the Royal Academy, followed by a picture of Mares and Foals in his Majesty's Stud at Windsor the following year. As well as painting the King's horses Davis clearly had access to the Royal Menagerie, and in 1827 painted a portrait of the Nubian Giraffe given to George VI by Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt (Royal Collection)."

English painter and writer. He was the son of the mezzotint engraver Philip Dawe who taught him engraving. He continued to concentrate on engraving when he entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1796, producing portraits until 1802, when he turned to history painting. In 1803 he won a gold medal and the following year made his début at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited until 1818, often showing such anecdotal and literary works as Imogen Found in the Cave of Belarius (Tate Gallery, London). He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1809 and a  Royal Academician in 1814 and soon afterwards returned to portrait painting."

Josse de Corte (also Giusto Le Court or Lecourt) was a Flemish sculptor who worked in Padua (altar in S. Giustina) and in Venice as a collaborator to Longhena. He had many commissions in Venice for decorating the palaces and churches. He followed the High Baroque style of Bernini.


"
1352,"DE FABRIS, Emilio","(b. 1808, Firenze, d. 1883, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/de_fabri/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He was most famous for his design of the west façade of the Santa Maria del Fiore, the Cathedral of Florence. The original façade design by Giotto was found outdated for the cathedral and so a series of three competitions were held to modify Giotto's original design, keeping with the main lines of the structure. The challenge for the competition was to create a façade which brought together two periods in architecture: the Gothic style, which had faded out, and the Renaissance style, which was more recent. In 1871, de Fabris's design won, and he immediately went to work embellishing the cathedral with red, green, and white marble.



"
1353,"DEÁK-ÉBNER, Lajos","(b. 1850, Pest, d.1934, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deak-ebn/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He studied in Munich and Paris. His first picture, Children with Parents, was exhibited in Vienna in 1873 where he met French painting and moved to Paris. He made friends with László Paál and Mihály Munkácsy in Barbizon. Munkácsy, J. Bastien-Lepage and J. F. Millet were of great influence on his development. From 1874 onwards, he spent summers in Szolnok and winters in Paris. He was an outstanding representative of the Szolnok art school. In his pictures from this period, peasants are portrayed with freshness and realism."
1354,"DEBUCOURT, Philibert-Louis","(b. 1755, Paris, d. 1832, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/debucour/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He was a protégé of Gabriel-Christophe Allegrain and was taught by Joseph-Marie Vien. His own preference was for genre painting in the Flemish style. In 1781 he was approved (agréé) as a member of the Académie Royale, Paris, on the basis of several works to be exhibited at that year's Salon; among these, the Charitable Gentleman (Paris, Galerie Cailleux) is a moralistic scene clearly inspired by Jean-Baptiste Greuze but using the technique of Isaack van Ostade. The pictures Debucourt exhibited at the Salons of 1783 and 1785 continued to draw their inspiration from Flemish art, then very popular in Paris, while remaining faithful to the realities of French peasant life. One of these works, The King's Act of Charity and Humanity (untraced; engraved in 1787 by Laurent Guyot), was accepted for exhibition in 1785 only after Debucourt had, by royal command, changed the title and made Louis XVI less easy to recognize."

French sculptor, son of the sculptor Jean Didier Debut (1824-1893). He studied under Henri Chapu at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1883 until the outbreak of the First World War."
1356,"DECAMPS, Alexandre Gabriel","(b. 1803, Paris, d. 1860, Fontainebleau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/decamps/biograph.html,"
French painter, draughtsman and printmaker. With his brother Maurice-Alexandre (1804-1852), the art critic and essayist, he spent some years of his youth at Orsay, in Picardy, 'in order to learn to rise early and know the hard life of the fields'. The artwork of the peasants stimulated an interest in drawing. He entered the atelier of Etienne Bouhot (1780-1862) in 1816. Towards the end of 1818 he left Bouhot to study under Alexandre-Denis Abel de Pujol, quitting his studio in 1819-20 in order to embark upon a career as an independent professional artist. Memories of Orsay remained his point of departure throughout his working life, and in this sense he was a self-trained artist. Nevertheless, he admired, and learnt from the art of such diverse artists as Raphael, Titian, Giambologna, Poussin, Rembrandt, Géricault and Léopold Robert."
1357,"DECKER, Coenraet","(b. 1651, Amsterdam, d. 1685, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/decker/biograph.html,"
Coenraet Decker was a Dutch etcher and engraver, student of Romeyn de Hooghe.



"
1358,"DECKER, Cornelis Gerritsz","(b. 1618, Haarlem, d. 1678, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/decker_c/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He is a relatively little-known Dutch landscape painter who was active in Haarlem. His work is in the manner of Jacob van Ruisdael who was his teacher. He also imitated the style of Jan Wynants and Philips Wouwerman.


"
1359,"DECKER, Paul the Elder","(b. 1677, Nürnberg, d. 1713, Bayreuth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/decker_p/biograph.html,"
German architect, printmaker, and designer. He is noted for his ornamental designs for goldsmiths' work, glass engraving, lacquer, etc. that were published in Nuremberg at the end of his life. His designs include chinoiseries and grotesques influenced by Jean Bérain I (1640-1711)."
1360,"DEDREUX, Alfred","(b. 1810, Paris, d. 1860, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dedreux/biograph.html,"
Alfred Dedreux (also spelt Alfred de Dreux), French painter and draughtsman. His father was the architect Pierre-Anne Dedreux (1788-1849); Alfred's sister, Louise-Marie Becq de Fouquières (1825-92), was also an artist. His uncle, Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy (1789-1874), a painter and intimate friend of Géricault, took Dedreux frequently to the atelier of Géricault whose choice of subjects, especially horses, had a lasting influence on him. During the 1820s he studied with Léon Cogniet (1794-1880), although his early style was more influenced by the work of Stubbs, Morland, Constable and Landseer, exposure to which probably came through Géricault and the painter Eugène Lami who lived in London in the mid-1820s."
1361,"DEFERNEX, Jean-Baptiste","(b. ca. 1729, Paris, d. 1783, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/defernex/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He stood outside the official academic establishment of French art in the 18th century, beginning his career as a modeller at the Vincennes-Sèvres porcelain manufactory, where he worked between 1754 and 1757, prior to the appointment of Etienne-Maurice Falconet as head of the sculpture studio. His task was to translate designs by François Boucher into clay models from which porcelain figures were made. Among his works for Sèvres are the Milkmaid and the Butter Churner (both Sèvres, Musée National de Céramique), reduced versions of the stone statuettes designed by Boucher for Mme de Pompadour's dairy at the Château de Crécy, near Abbeville. In 1760 Defernex became a member of the Académie de St-Luc and in 1762 exhibited at its Salon two talc statuettes in a similar charming manner, the Stone-cutter and its pendant, the Girl Shelling Oysters (both untraced)."
1362,"DEGAS, Edgar","(b. 1834, Paris, d. 1917, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/degas/biograph.html,"
French painter and sculptor. He was born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar de Gas into a wealthy banking family. His father, Pierre-Auguste-Hyacinthe de Gas was a manager of a branch of private bank belonging to Edgar's grandfather in Naples. His mother, Célestine Musson, was of Creole descent and came from New Orleans. Although prepared for the law, he abandoned it for painting, studying from 1853 to 1855 at the École des Beaux-Arts with Louis Lamothe and Hippolyte Flandrin, who passed on their valuable expertise on the works of Ingres.
"
1363,"DEGEN, Endris II",(active 1555-1583 in Augsburg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/degen/biograph.html,"
Endris (Andreas) II Degen, German goldsmith, active in Augsburg, one of the 16th-century prolific centres of goldsmithry in Germany. No biographical data are known about him.



"
1364,"DEGLER, Hans","(b. 1564, München, d. 1637, Weilheim)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/degler/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, one of the leading sculptors active in Weilheim. He may have been born in Munich and he probably trained with Adam Krumpper (c. 1576-1582), with whom he later collaborated. At least 25 projects are either signed or documented and another 13 are attributed to Degler; unfortunately, only about half of these survive. Degler's most famous and earliest creations are the high altar (1604), two side altars (1607) and pulpit (ca. 1608) in St. Ulrich und St. Afra, Augsburg. He also specialized in richly painted life-size statues of the Virgin and Child.



"
1365,"DEGOUVE DE NUNCQUES, William","(b. 1867, Monthermé, d. 1935, Stavelot)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/degouve/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter of French birth. After the Franco-Prussian war (1870-71), his parents settled in Belgium. Although self-taught, he was advised by Jan Toorop, with whom he shared a studio, and later lived with Henry de Groux (1867-1930). In 1894 he married Juliette Massin, a painter and Emile Verhaeren's sister-in-law, who introduced him to the circle of Symbolist poets. His art, which bears the influence of poetry, transfigures reality in the sense that it affords a view of the invisible."
1366,"DELABRIERRE, Paul Edouard","(b. 1829, Paris, d. 1912, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delabrie/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, an important member of the Animalier school in late 19th-century Paris. He studied art under the painter Jean-Baptiste Delestre (1800-1871) but found his true calling was with the rendering of three-dimensional sculpture. He was greatly influenced by the combat works of the great master Antoine-Louis Barye and many of Delabrierre's combat models show this violence of nature, which was very popular at that time. Many of the sculptures he executed often incorporated figures as well as animals."
1367,"DELACROIX, Eugène","(b. 1798, Charenton-Saint-Maurice, d. 1863, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delacroi/biograph.html,"
The greatest French painter of the Romantic movement. He was the son of a politician, Charles Delacroix, but there is some evidence to indicate that his real father was the diplomat Talleyrand, a friend of the family. His mother, Victoire Oeben, came of a family of notable craftsmen and designers."
1368,"DELAFOSSE, Jean-Charles","(b 1734, Paris, d. 1789, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delafoss/biograph.html,"
French decorative designer, engraver and architect. In 1747 he was apprenticed to the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Poullet (d. 1775), but he seems not to have completed his apprenticeship. By 1767 he styled himself 'architecte et professeur pour le dessin'. In 1768 he published the first volume of his most important work, the Nouvelle iconologie historique. It contains 110 plates, nearly all engraved by Delafosse himself, with designs for furniture, decorative objects and architectural ornament in the heavy, classicising, Louis XVI style. In addition, each design bears a particular, usually complex, symbolic or iconological meaning, pertaining to an almost encyclopedic range of subject-matter."
1369,"DELAISTRE, François-Nicolas","(b. 1746, Paris, d. 1832, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delaistr/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was a pupil of Félix Lecomte and of Louis-Claude Vassé. He won the Prix de Rome in 1772 and, after a year at the Ecole Royale des Elèves Protégés, completed his training at the Académie de France in Rome between 1773 and 1777. It was there that he probably first met the architect Pierre-Adrien Pâris, for whom he later worked and who owned several of his terracotta models (Besançon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). His best-known work, the group Cupid and Psyche, was originally executed in Rome (later marble version; Paris, Louvre); it is a graceful, rather precious treatment of a theme popular with Neo-classical sculptors, made for the collector Pierre-Marie Gaspard Grimod, Comte d'Orsay.



"
1370,"DELAMAIR, Pierre-Alexis","(b. ca. 1676, Paris, d. 1745, Châtenay-Malabry)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delamair/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the son of Antoine Delamair, architect and contractor to the Royal Works. He was involved with the embellishment of the city of Paris, and in 1699 he submitted designs for a pedestal for the statue (destroyed) of King Louis XIV in the Place Vendôme, Paris. In 1704 he began to build a town house at 142, Rue de Grenelle, Paris, for the Abbé de Pompadour; this was a single-storey building in which the articulation of the façade and sculptural decoration prefigured his later work."
1371,"DELANE, Solomon","(b. ca. 1727, Dublin, d. 1812, Dublin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delane/biograph.html,"
Irish landscape painter in a classical tradition. Solomon Delane (Delany; Delaney) was born in County Tipperary, the son of a Clergyman, Richard and his wife Sarah. He was brought up at Upper Coombe, Dublin, and received his training in the Dublin Schools under West, and where he also attended the Dublin Society's School of Landscape and Ornament under James Mannin. He won a prize at the Dublin Society in 1750, when he was placed second in the order of merit."
1372,"DELAROCHE, Paul","(b. 1797, Paris, d. 1859, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delaroch/biograph.html,"
French painter, one of the leading pupils of Gros. He achieved great popularity with his melodramatic history scenes, engravings of his work hanging in thousands of homes. Often he chose subjects from English history, as with two of his most famous works, The Little Princes in the Tower (Louvre, Paris, 1831) and The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (National Gallery, London, 1833). They are Romantic in flavour, but academically impeccable in their draughtsmanship and detailing. After a period when such pictures were totally out of favour, his work is once again being treated seriously.



"
1373,"DELAVALLÉE, Henri","(b. 1862, Reims, d. 1943, Pont-Aven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delavall/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. After university studies at the Sorbopnne, he studied at the college of art in Paris. In 1881 he visited Pont-Aven, where in 1886 he joined the group of artists influenced by Gauguin, especially Émile Bernard.  He painted impressionist, synthetist and occasionally pointillist paintings, but mainly worked as a graphic artist. In 1890 he exhibited at Durand-Ruel's. In 1891-1901 he visited Turkey, and he became a successful landscape and portrait painter. Thereafter he lived in the Oise valley and at Pont-Aven.



"
1374,"DELCOUR, Jean","(b. 1631, Hamoir, d. 1707, Liège)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delcour/biograph.html,"
Jean Delcour (or Del Cour), Flemish sculptor. At the age of 15 he became a sculpture pupil in Liège of the Carthusian monk Robert Arnold Henrard (c. 1616-1676) who after living for a while in Rome, had introduced a style in Liège based on the classicism of François Duquesnoy. Henrard may have encouraged his pupil to go to Rome himself, to improve his skills. In the 1650s Delcour spent several years in Rome, where he was influenced by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. He was back working in Liège by 1663, and would go on working there until his death, building up a lasting reputation as a gifted sculptor. He set up a workshop and sculpted wood, marble, and ivory for the wealthy leaders of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège."
1375,"DELEMER, Jean",(active mid 15th century in Tournai and Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delemer/biograph.html,"
Jean Delemer was a Flemish sculptor.  He was paid in 1428 for carving a life-size stone Annunciation group, painted by Robert Campin for St Pierre, Tournai. It is known that other pieces modelled by him were painted by Robert Campin. No other works by the sculptor have survived in Tournai, but a number of later Tournaisian sculptures appear to reflect lost works by Delemer."
1376,"DELEN, Dirck van","(b. 1604/5, Heusden, d. 1671, Arnemuiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the pupil of Frans Hals and Hendrick Aerts (active early 17th century). His work consists almost entirely of architectural paintings of imaginary palaces and church interiors. His earliest paintings of palace scenes were influenced significantly by the work of Hans Vredeman de Vries and his son Paul Vredeman de Vries. He also painted church interiors, in which he initially showed an influence of the paintings by Hendrick Aerts. His church interiors are also close in style to those of Bartholomeus van Bassen."
1377,"DELESPINE, Jean","(b. 1505, d. 1576, Angers)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delespin/biograph.html,"
Jean Delespine (also Jean de l'Espine), French architect. He was the master builder in the former province of Anjou, where about forty works are attributed to him. He was the student of Jean Mariau, an architect in Angers, to whom he succeeded, in 1535, as Commissaire des oeuvres et réparations de la ville of Angers."
1378,"DELFF, Cornelis Jacobsz","(b. ca. 1570, Gouda, d. 1643, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delff/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of Jacob Willemsz. Delff. He trained with Cornelis Cornelisz. in Haarlem. By 1610, he had settled in Delft where he spent the rest of his life. He entered the Guild of St Luke in 1613. He is one of the earliest painters of still-life, he was admired by his contemporaries for his singular depictions of kitchen interiors, the earliest of which dates to 1597.



"
1379,"DELFF, Jacob Willemsz I","(b. ca. 1550, Gouda, d. 1601, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delff/jacob1/biograph.html,"
Jacob Willemsz Delff I was the leading portrait painter in Delft at the end of the 16th century. He was the founder of a well-known Dutch family of artists. He came from Gouda and probably studied with Anthonie Blocklandt in Delft, where the young artist was admitted to the Guild of St Luke in 1575 and acquired citizenship seven years later. He had three sons by his marriage to Maria Nagel, all of whom became artists: the still-life painter Cornelis, the portraitist Rochus, and the engraver Willem. He immortalised his entire family grouped around his easel. The son of Willem, Jacob Willemsz Delff II was also a painter."
1380,"DELFF, Jacob Willemsz II","(b. 1619, Delft, d. 1661, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delff/jacob2/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of the engraver Willem Jacobsz Delff, and grandson of the Delft portraitist Jacob Willemsz Delff I. He was trained in the workshop of his other grandfather, Michiel Jansz. van Miereveld, another significant portrait painter in Delft at the beginning of the seventeenth century. After the death of Miereveld in 1641, the young Delff took over and lead the prosperous workshop which produced many portraits in the style of Miereveld.



"
1381,"DELFF, Willem Jacobsz","(b. 1580, Delft, d. 1638, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delff/willem/biograph.html,"
Dutch engraver. He was the son of the Delft portrait painter Jacob Willemsz. Delff I, from whom he presumably received his earliest artistic instruction. Because his earliest known work, an engraved portrait of Christianus Goesius ('Bailiff in Delft'; 1600), was made after a drawing by the Antwerp engraver Johan Wierix, it has sometimes been assumed that Delff studied engraving under this Flemish artist. This, however, is unlikely since the original drawing had been made over 20 years earlier. It is far more probable that Delff was taught engraving by a Dutch artist, possibly Hendrick Goltzius. In the first part of his career Delff devoted himself primarily to producing book illustrations. He also produced portrait prints after the work of such painters as Michiel Jansz. van Miereveld and Jan Anthonisz. van Ravesteyn.



"
1382,"DELL, Peter the Elder","(b. ca. 1490, Würzburg, d. 1552, Würzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dell/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, the leading sculptor in Würzburg during the second quarter of the 16th century. He was documented as a pupil of Tilmann Riemenschneider sometime between 1505 and 1510. His style owes more, however, to the powerful monumentality of Hans Leinberger, who probably employed him as an apprentice in Landshut around 1515. Before returning to Würzburg in 1534, Dell probably worked in Regensburg (c. 1520-21), the Lower Main River area (1520s) and Freiberg, Saxony (1528-33). While in Freiberg, he carved at least four limewood reliefs, of the Crucifixion, Resurrection and Holy Teaching (all Dresden, Grünes Gewölbe) and the Fall of the Rebel Angels (untraced), for Henry, Duke of Saxony. Other religious reliefs by Dell are in Berlin, Nuremberg and Stuttgart."
1383,"DELORME, Philibert","(b. ca. 1515, Lyon, d. 1570, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delorme/biograph.html,"
Philibert Delorme (also known as Philibert de L'Orme), French architect. He was one of the great Renaissance architects of the 16th century and, possibly, the first French architect to possess some measure of the universal outlook of the Italian masters but without merely imitating them. Mindful that French architectural requirements differed from Italian, and respectful of native materials, he founded his designs on sound engineering principles. He assimilated the orders of classical architecture and mastered their use; but, being a man with an independent, logical turn of mind and a vigorous personality, he fused the orders with a delicacy of invention, restraint, and harmony characteristic of purest French classicism."
1384,"DELOYE, Gustave","(b. 1838, Sedan, d. 1899, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deloye/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1857. The large number of allegorical, partly polychromatic statues, statuettes and groups of sculptures, busts and medallions bear witness to the extraordinary productivity of this artist. He worked for clients in Russia and Italy. He produced the caryatides of the Château de Chenonceaux and the Château de Boissière, as well as the monument of Garibaldi in Nice, left unfinished by Antoine Étex."
1385,"DELPY, Hippolyte-Camille","(b. 1824, Joigny, d. 1910, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delpy/biograph.html,"
French painter, a student of Charles François Daubigny. It was Daubigny, a friend of the Delpy family, who took the young Camille along with him on his strolls. Inspired by Daubigny and his creations, Camille's only childhood aspiration was to become a painter. In Paris, Daubigny introduced his young pupil to Corot. It was a moment of intense emotion when Corot admitted the young Delpy into his studio."
1386,"DELSENBACH, Johann Adam","(b. 1687, Nürnberg, d. 1765, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delsenba/biograph.html,"
German painter and engraver. He studied with the portrait engraver Augustin Fleischmann and attended the Nuremberg Painters Academy. He travelled in Saxony, and in 1710 arrived in Vienna and made copper engravings for Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. During the 1713 plague in Vienna he returned to Nuremberg. In 1718 he was again in Vienna and was appointed Court Engraver by the Prince of Liechtenstein. In 1721, after the death of the prince, he settled again in Nuremberg."
1387,"DELVAUX, Laurent","(b. 1696, Gent, d. 1778, Nivelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/delvaux/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor who went to London in 1717 to work with his fellow Fleming Scheemakers. In 1728 they went to Italy together, where Delvaux spent several years, on and off, before returning to Brussels, where he got a Court appointment in 1733. In Brussels he made a large number of statues for churches, several important pulpits (e.g. Ghent Cathedral, 1745), and a number of tombs; he worked on two tombs in Westminster Abbey with Scheemakers, and there are works, including terracotta models, in London and Brussels.



"
1388,"DEMARNE, Jean-Louis","(b. 1752, Bruxelles, d. 1829, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/demarne/biograph.html,"
Jean-Louis Demarne (also spelt de Marne), French painter. He went to Paris at the age of 12 after the death of his father, who had been in Brussels as an officer in the service of the Emperor of Austria. Having spent eight years studying history painting with Gabriel Briard (1729-1777), he entered the Prix de Rome in 1772 and 1774 but failed to win."
1389,"DEMIN, Giovanni","(b. 1786, Belluno, d. 1859, Tarzo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/demin/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Demin (or Giovanni de Min), Italian painter and engraver. He was born into a family of humble origin. In Padua, Demin first apprenticed with Paolo De Filippi, who noting his skills, and with the patronage of the Falier family of San Vitale, had him enrolled by 1804 at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice. There he studied alongside Francesco Hayez, and was a pupil of the painter Teodoro Matteini and Pietro Tantini. In 1808, Demin was awarded a stipend from the Academy to study in Rome. There he fell under the influence of Neoclassical artists such as Canova."
1390,"DEMMLER, Georg Adolph","(b. 1804, Berlin, d. 1886, Schwerin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/demmler/biograph.html,"
German politician and architect. Demmler, the illegitimate son of a chimney sweep, drew his first blueprint of a house when he was only 14 years old. He studied architecture at the Academy in Berlin, where Karl Friedrich Schinkel was his mentor. Demmler went on to enter the civil service as a young architect in Mecklenburg. Within only a year he was promoted from being a simple master builder to working as court architect for the Grand Duke."
1391,"DEMUT-MALINOVSKY, Vasily Ivanovich","(b. 1779, St. Petersburg, d. 1846, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/demut/biograph.html,"
Russian sculptor. He was the son of a carver and studied at the Academy of Arts from 1785 to 1800, where he very soon distinguished himself. In 1800 he produced the bronze low-relief Battle at Gangut for the base of Bartolommeo Carlo Rastrelli's monument to Peter I, placed in front of the Mikhaylovsky Castle in St Petersburg (in situ). In 1802-03 he executed the tombstone for Mikhail Ivanovich Kozlovsky (marble; St Petersburg, Sculpture Museum). Between 1803 and 1806 he worked in Rome under Antonio Canova. Success came to him with two colossal statues for the Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg."
1392,"DENÉCHEAU, Séraphin","(b. 1831, Angers, d. 1912, Angers)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/denechea/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied in the workshops of François Rude and especially David d'Angers. An artist of portraits, mythological and allegorical groups, he had numerous commissions from the French State, the Palais du Louvre, the Opéra de Paris, the Gare du Nord, and a number of Parisian and other churches (Saint Etienne du Mont, Notre Dame de la Croix de Ménilmontant, Cathedral of Moulins)."
1393,"DENIS, Simon-Joseph-Alexandre-Clément","(b. 1755, Antwerpen, d. 1812, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/denis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, regarded as an early practitioner of plein-air painting. He was trained in his native city of Antwerp, and moved to Paris in the 1770s. About ten years later he relocated to Rome, where he spent the majority of his career. Although Denis was not an official student of French landscape painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, he followed the elder and more famous artist's example. Denis's cloud studies probably predate Valenciennes' influential 1800 treatise on landscape, which emphasized direct observation from nature. Both men were among the first to produce oil-on-paper sketches outdoors, a practice that became increasingly popular in the 1800s. "
1394,"DENTE DA RAVENNA, Marco","(b. ca. 1486, Ravenna, d. 1527, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dente/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver. He was active in Rome during the early 16th century. Some early writers confused him with Silvestro da Ravenna, and his family name was unknown until its rediscovery by Zani. He studied with Marcantonio Raimondi and was strongly influenced by the latter's style. He often collaborated with Agostino Veneziano, another Marcantonio student who also had some influence on Dente's work. Dente was evidently born in Ravenna, although his birth date is undocumented. His earliest signed and dated print is inscribed 1515, suggesting that he was active from c. 1510 and was probably born in the late 15th century. He was killed in the Sack of Rome in 1527."
1395,DEODATO DI ORLANDI,(documented 1284-1315 in Lucca),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deodato/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was an eclectic and apparently prolific artist whose works record the transition from Italo-Byzantine painting of the 13th century to the Giottesque milieu of the 14th. They also indicate the importance of Florentine styles for Lucchese painting in his time. The earliest work attributed to him is a Crucifix with a living Christ (c. 1280; Pisa, Museo Nazionale di San Matteo), and if this attribution is correct it suggests that his early development was influenced by Berlinghiero Berlinghieri."
1396,"DEPPE, Ludwig",(active c. 1820 in Berlin),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deppe/biograph.html,"
German painter. He is known from only two signed paintings of 1820. No biographical data are available about him.



"
1397,"DERAND, Père François","(b. ca. 1588, Vic-sur-Seille, d. 1644, Agde)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/derand/biograph.html,"
French Jesuit priest and architect. Entering the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in 1611, he studied in Rouen and La Flèche, was ordained a priest in 1621 and studied theology in Paris (1621-22). He had also taught grammar at Rennes (1615-18) and mathematics at La Flèche (1618-21). He worked first as an architect at the Jesuit college in Rouen, where from 1622 to 1629 he was praefectus fabricae; then as architectus at the college in Rennes, where he supervised the building works; at the college of Orléans, for which he provided plans in 1632; and, above all, at the Jesuit church in Paris, Saint-Louis (now Saint-Paul-et-Saint-Louis). In plans for the latter he found himself in competition with Étienne Martellange. Both sets of plans were submitted to Rome; those by Martellange were preferred, and he began work on the church in 1627. Two years later, however, the Father Provincial brought in Derand, who found the building erected to a height of two metres. He finished it in 1641, including the vaults and the great façade on the Rue Saint-Antoine, the first stone of which was laid in 1634."
1398,"DERMOYEN, Willem",(active 1520-1530s in Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dermoyen/biograph.html,"
Dermoyen (also d'Armoyen or Moy), family of Brussels weavers and tapestry dealers, who played a leading role in the production in the period c. 1510-1550. In 1527 Christiaan was persecuted for heresy. The best known member is Willem, who supplied sets for Henry III of Nassau in 1532-33, François I of France in 1529-34, and to Mary of Hungary in 1535. In 1533 the firm sent Dermoyen and the painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst to Constantinople, and in the same year Willem, in partnership with the Antwerp merchant Pieter van de Walle, offered an edition of the Battle of Pavia to the sultan.



"
1399,"DERUET, Claude","(b. 1588, Nancy, d. 1662, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deruet/biograph.html,"
French painter. As a young man he went to Italy, where he executed a small fresco in the Villa Borghese, Rome. He seems to have learned little from his Italian sojourn, however, and almost all the influences on his style are traceable to his native Lorraine. He was the favourite court painter of Duke Henry II of Lorraine and also of Louis XIII of France, whose drawing master he became. A touching record of this latter relationship survives in the drawing by Louis XIII of Deruet in the Musée Historique Lorrain at Nancy. None of Deruet's important decorations for the Lorraine court survive, and his frescoes for the Carmelite church were destroyed with the building during the Revolution of 1789."

1401,"DESBOUTIN, Marcellin","(b. 1823, Cérilly, d. 1902, Nice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/desbouti/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker, collector and writer. He was born into a wealthy, aristocratic family, his parent were Bartholomew Desboutin, a bodyguard of Louis XVIII, and Baroness Anne-Sophie de Rochefort-Dalie Farges. He showed an early talent for drawing but initially trained and registered as a lawyer, though he never practiced. In 1845 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, studying first under the sculptor Louis-Jules Etex (1810-1889) and from 1847-48 under Thomas Couture."
1402,"DESCOURTIS, Charles-Melchior","(b. 1753, Paris, d. 1820, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/descourt/biograph.html,"
French printmaker. He was a pupil of Jean-François Janinet and, like him, specialized in the production of colour prints using aquatint and wash-manner. Among his earliest known works is a series of four engravings of views of Paris and Rome after paintings by Pierre Antoine de Machy, which appeared in 1784. He collaborated with Janinet on the illustrations for Vues remarquables des montagnes de la Suisse (1785), which were engraved after several artists. He is best known, however, for his four colour prints after the genre scenes of Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, notably the Village Wedding (1785) and its pendant, the Village Fair (1788). The subtle green tones of the landscape setting, complementing the white and red of the small figures, successfully convey the gentle mood of Taunay's rural scenes. The second pair, the Tambourine and the Brawl, both animated, slightly grotesque compositions, are less finely executed. Such prints of genre scenes were avidly collected by contemporaries."
1403,"DESHAYS, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1729, Colleville, d. 1765, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/deshays/biograph.html,"
French painter (also spelt Deshayes). He first trained with his father, Jean-Dominique Deshays, an obscure painter in Rouen. After a brief period at Jean-Baptiste Descamps's Ecole Gratuite de Dessin, he entered the studio in Paris of Hyacinthe Collin de Vermont c. 1740. There he acquired the foundations of the mastery of drawing for which he later became celebrated."

Like most of his contemporaries he formed his style on Donatello's work of the 1430s. He learnt from Donatello the practice of carving in very low relief, and the lively, thick-set figures of children on the Singing Gallery made by Donatello for Florence Cathedral (1433-39) provided models for Desiderio's own reliefs of the Madonna and Child.

Louis Desplaces was a French printmaker and draftsman. This little known artist was perhaps the most colourful of all the engravers of his time. He was an excellent interpreter of Rubens, Veronese and especially Largillière. His work (about 75 sheets) includes reproductions of paintings from the Galerie du Palais Royal, works for the Cabinet Crozat, and for the Recueil Jullienne, as well as various portraits and other pieces.

French painter of dogs, game, and emblems of the chase. In his early career he worked much as a portraitist, notably in 1695-96 at the court of Jan Sobieski (John III) in Poland, but on his return to France he took up hunting subjects and won the patronage of Louis XIV and Louis XV. He achieved considerable celebrity (he was well received on a visit to England in 1712) and in his field was rivaled only by Oudry. Although he continued the lavish Flemish tradition exemplified by Snyders, Desportes was among the first artists of the 18th century to make landscape studies from nature for his backgrounds, and because of this he was considered eccentric. His work is well represented in the Louvre (which has his self-portrait as a Huntsman, 1699) and in the Wallace Collection, London.

He learned his trade in Flanders in the workshop of Abraham Janssens together with his stepbrother Nicolas Régnier, with whom he moved to Rome in the first half of the 1620s. He was employed in Bologna around 1630 in the workshop of Guido Reni who exerted a crucial influence on him. He worked for a long time in the Veneto region and there is evidence of his presence in 1665 in Parma, where the significant paintings he left include a large altarpiece with the Madonna and Saints for the Cathedral and a canvas on the secular subject of Sacred Love Triumphing over Profane Love."

From 1775 to 1779 he exhibited at the Free Society, in 1777 at the Society of Artists and between 1782 and 1788 at the Royal Academy. His few known works are portraits; these show that while he maintained the directness of his father's work, he never managed to achieve his sophistication. The lists of his exhibited works include landscapes and copies from Old Masters (untraced).

1415,"DEVIS, Arthur William","(b. 1762, London, d. 1822, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/devis/william/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters, son of Arthur Devis. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1774 and soon attracted the attention of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He exhibited various drawings at the Free Society between 1775 and 1780 and at the Royal Academy in 1781-82. In 1782 he joined an expedition to the East Indies as a draughtsman.

Laurent-Benoît (also Laurentius Benedictus) Dewez, Flemish architect. He is considered the most influential architect in the Austrian Netherlands (present-day Belgium) from the second half of the 18th century. His architectural projects are of international stature and introduced a Neoclassical style, with Italian and English influences, to the region. He designed a large number of châteaux, abbeys and churches in southern Netherlands, many of which were damaged after the French Revolution."

Between 1891 and 1895 he studied art in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under Gérome, Bouguereau and Constant and at the Académie Julian. Here he particularly responded to the Impressionists in their use of bold colour and broken handling to convey the effects of light. He painted Impressionist landscapes in the environs of Paris, and he admired Monet. In 1897 he exhibited for the first time at the Salon."
1418,"DEWING, Thomas Wilmer","(b. 1851, Boston, d. 1938, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dewing/biograph.html,"
American painter. As a child he was interested in both drawing and in playing the violin; this early interest in music would later reappear in the themes of many of his paintings. By 1872, after a period of apprenticeship in a lithography shop, Dewing was listing his profession as ""artist."" He studied paintings in the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, especially the works of Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin.

On 17 July 1447 he was paid for gilding a temporary predella for Lippi's Coronation of the Virgin (Florence, Uffizi). At Prato he assisted Lippi on his fresco cycle in the choir of the parish church (now the cathedral) between 1452 and 1466. In July 1460 Diamante received payment on Lippi's behalf for the latter's completion of Pesellino's Trinity with Saints (London, National Gallery), and in the same month he is recorded as a Vallombrosan monk. At this time he probably executed the frescoes of St John Gualbertus and St Albert of Trapani beside the window of the choir of Prato Cathedral."

1422,"DÍAZ, Diego Valentín","(b. 1586, Valladolid, d. 1680, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/diaz/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and collector. He was the son and pupil of the painter Pedro Díaz Minaya (c. 1555-1624), who worked in Valladolid, the location of Philip III's court from 1600 to 1606. For more than 50 years, Diego Valentín Díaz was Valladolid's most important painter, producing a great number of religious works and portraits containing colourful imagery; many of these are widely dispersed in collections and churches throughout Spain. However, he is likely to have painted still-life and flower paintings over his long career, too. A number of flower paintings mentioned in his post-mortem inventory of 1661 were probably his own work."

French landscape painter of the Barbizon School. He was born of Spanish parents in Bordeaux. His earlier works were Romantic compositions in the manner of Delacroix, but later he became a painter of the forest. He spent much time at Barbizon and although he is the least exalted of the half-dozen great artists who are usually grouped round that name, he sometimes produced works of the highest quality."

German painter and etcher. He received his first training from his father, Johann Georg Dietrich (1684-1752), a court painter at Weimar, and was sent to Dresden at the age of 13 to study under the landscape painter Johann Alexander Thiele. In 1728 they travelled to Arnstadt to paint landscapes for stage sets. In 1730 Thiele presented his pupil to Frederick-Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, as a prodigy; Frederick-Augustus appointed him court painter and entrusted him to his minister Heinrich, Graf von Brühl, for whom he worked on some decorative paintings.

In 1575 he painted frescoes on the façade of the Brüderhof (destroyed. 1769).In 1589, he worked on the decoration of the Neu Bau (now Chambre de Commerce) in Strasbourg; the frescoes, known from engravings of the building and from descriptions, combined mythological and biblical scenes in an interesting iconographical relationship and emphasized the architectural structure of the façade. Dietterlin's only authenticated easel painting is the signed and dated Raising of Lazarus (?1582 or ?1587; Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle), which has the characteristics of northern Mannerism."
1433,"DIEUSSART, François","(b. ca. 1600, Armentières, d. 1661, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dieussar/biograph.html,"
François (Frans) Dieussart, Flemish sculptor. A fully-trained carver from an unknown artistic background in southern Flanders, he, a French-speaker, went to Rome in 1618, presumably to further his knowledge in the vibrant atmosphere for sculpture created by papal patronage. He was likely an active sculptor by the time he arrived in Rome. Bernini's novel types of bust seem particularly to have impressed Dieussart, who was commonly called 'Il Vallone' - 'The Walloon'."
1434,"DIJCK, Floris Claesz van","(b. 1575, Haarlem, d. 1651, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dijck/biograph.html,"

Abraham van Dijck (Dyck), Dutch painter and draughtsman. He is thought to have been a pupil of Rembrandt in Amsterdam c. 1650. There is no documentary evidence for this, but his earliest dated painting, the Presentation in the Temple (1655; private collection), shows that he had certainly seen examples of Rembrandt's work. He was an eclectic artist, given to following several models simultaneously. This is evident from two versions of Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath; one (1655-60; Copenhagen, Statens Museum for Kunst) is painted in horizontal format in the style of Barent Fabritius, while the other (1655-60; private collection) features large half-length figures in the manner of Nicolaes Maes. In another biblical scene, Benjamin and Judah (1655-60; Chicago, Art Institute), he followed the example of Rembrandt. His best works, such as Saying Grace (1655-60; Hannover, Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum) and the Old Prophetess (1655-60; Leipzig, Museum der Bildenden Künste), show old women either praying or sleeping and confirm that Maes was his main source of inspiration. Similar subjects are represented in the drawings attributed to him (e.g. Old Woman Seated, Holding a Book; New York, Pierpont Morgan Library)."

While working under the direction of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse on the sculptural decoration (1870-73) of the Brussels Bourse, he met Auguste Rodin, who employed him in his Brussels studio until 1877. At the Antwerp Salon of 1875 he exhibited Enigma (Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent), a seated female nude whose informal pose and lack of allegorical disguise were considered subversive. The following year he founded the group L'Essor in Brussels."

German draughtsman, painter, engraver, museum director and teacher. He was the eldest son of the Elector's head forester, Wolfgang Dillis, and godson of Maximilian III Joseph, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, who paid for him to attend the Gymnasium in Munich. In 1782, after studying theology in Ingolstadt, Dillis became a pupil of Ignaz Oefele (1721-1797) and Johann Jakob Dorner the Elder (1741-1813) at the Munich Zeichnungsakademie, supporting himself by giving drawing lessons to the children of noble families. His earliest surviving drawings from the 1770s (Munich, Stadtarchiv and Stadtmuseum) show villages around Munich. This evident gift for landscape was encouraged by Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753-1814), an American who worked for the Bavarian Elector and created the Englischer Garten in Munich. He commissioned Dillis to make drawings of the most interesting areas in the Bavarian mountains (almost all Munich, Staatliche Graphische Sammlung and Schloss Nymphenburg). Through Rumford, Dillis was able to accompany Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston, and his family to Salzburg in 1794. Following this, Dillis made the first of many journeys to Italy (1794-95)."

He worked in Moscow and the surrounding towns and in several northern monasteries, including those of Iosifo-Volokolamsky, Ferapontov and St Paul at Obnorsk (founded 1414). Paintings attributed to him represent the apogee of the classicizing style in Russian religious art, although by the end of his life much of his work was apparently done with the help of assistants. Various sources refer to Dionysius, but he is first mentioned in the Life of Pafnuty of Borovsk, which records that he decorated the cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin (Rozhdestvo bogoroditsy) in the Pafnutev Monastery in Borovsk with wall paintings (c. 1467; destroyed), together with the older icon painter, Mitrofan, and their assistants."

His landscapes show the influence of Marco Ricci in both composition and colouring as well as technique; like Ricci he often executed gouaches. A large collection of these works can today be found in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Venice and in the Museo Civico in Padua."
1444,"DIZIANI, Gaspare","(b. 1689, Belluno, d. 1767, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/diziani/gaspare/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. His earliest training was in Belluno with Antonio Lazzarini (1672-1732), the last exponent in the Veneto of Baroque tenebrism. Having moved to Venice, he joined the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini and later that of Sebastiano Ricci, who was in Venice until 1715 and exerted the strongest influence on his development; presumably Diziani was familiar with Ricci's many paintings in Belluno before becoming his pupil. Between 1710 and 1720 he painted a group of eight pictures that included the Mary Magdalene for S Stefano, Belluno, and the Entry into Jerusalem for S Teodoro, Venice. His speed of production and technical assurance are demonstrated especially in his preparatory oil sketches, with colour applied in rapid and spirited penlike strokes. He was also working as a scenery painter in many Venetian theatres, an employment that led to commissions first in Munich (1717) and later in Dresden, where he was highly acclaimed."
1445,"DO, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1617, Valencia, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/do/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active in Italy. An Adoration of the Shepherds (c. 1623; Naples, Capodimonte) was attributed to Do by de Dominici in 1742 and remains the only work the attribution of which is widely accepted. Yet modern scholars who have reconstructed his career believe him to have made a major contribution to Neapolitan painting in the first half of the 17th century."
1446,"DOBSON, William","(b. 1610, London, d. 1646, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dobson/biograph.html,"English painter. He was described by his contemporary Aubrey as 'the most excellent painter England hath yet bred', and as such he succeeded van Dyck as Court Painter in 1642 and to some of the position of van Dyck, whose assistant he may have been. It is, however, not certain that he was van Dyck's pupil (an early Self-Portrait is markedly Rembrandtesque), or even that he was appointed Serjeant Painter. His impasted and robust style is more Italianate than van Dyck's, and may have been formed on a study of the superb Titians and other Venetian pictures in Charles I's collection.

"
1447,"DODIN, Charles-Nicolas","(b. 1734, Versailles, d. 1803, Sèvres)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dodin/biograph.html,"
French miniature painter. For nearly half a century Charles-Nicolas Dodin worked as a miniature painter at the porcelain manufactory of Vincennes-Sevrès, where he was considered one of the best artists. The fine quality of his work was early recognized by the managers of the royal manufactory, which meant that there were soon examples of it in the best French and other European collections, including those of Louis XV and the last two royal mistresses, Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry, as well as Louis XVI and his brothers Louis Stanislas Xavier, comte de Provence (later Louis XVIII), and Charles Philippe, comte d'Artois (later Charles X).

Netherlandish engraver, part of a family of printmakers from Deventer. The members of the family were Joannes, Lucas, Baptista and Joannes the Younger."
1449,"DOLCI, Carlo","(b. 1616, Firenze, d. 1686, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dolci/biograph.html,"He was the leading painter in Florence in the mid-17th century, and an exponent of the restrained style of Late Baroque comparable with Sacchi's Roman works. Dolci was extremely precocious and one of his finest pictures is the portrait, painted when he was 16, of Fra Ainolfo dei Bardi (1632, Florence, Pitti). Nevertheless, he later became very neurotic and felt himself to be professionally inadequate. Most of his later works are small devotional pictures often painted on copper in an extremely finicky and detailed manner. When Giordano was in Florence in 1682 he said jokingly that his own virtuoso style had brought him a fortune of 150,000 scudi, but that by spending so much time on his works Dolci would starve; an idea that preyed on Dolci's mind."
1450,"DOLENDO, Zacharias","(b. 1561, Leiden, d. ca. 1602, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dolendo/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish engraver, part of a Dutch family of engravers active in the 16th and 17th centuries. He made several portraits as well as engravings after Abraham Bloemaert, Jacob de Gheyn, Bartholomaeus Spranger, Hendrick Goltzius and Karel van Mander.

He was Annibale Carracci's favourite pupil and one of the most important upholders of the tradition of Bolognese classicism. After studying with Calvaert and Lodovico Carracci he went to Rome (1602) and joined the colony of artists working under Annibale Carracci at the Palazzo Farnese. His only undisputed work there is the Maiden with the Unicorn, a charming, gentle fresco over the entrance of the Gallery.

Italian painter, probably identical with the anonymous master named Master of the Langmatt Foundation, a name coming from the series of thirteen vedute owned by the Langmatt Foundation in Baden near Zurich. He is best known for his pictorial representations of views of Venice and its surroundings. His name is recorded in the records of the fraglia or guild of Venetian painters in 1757, and it often appears as the painter of many works sent by the art dealer Giovanni Maria Sasso to the English minister John Strange in the second half of the eighteenth century. He was active at least 1770."
1453,DOMENICO DI AGOSTINO,"(d. 1369, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/domenico/agostino/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, active in Siena. He designed the chapel on the Piazza del Campo (the main square of Siena). He also designed the unfinished Gothic façade of the Baptistery, built in the 14th century beneath the cathedral's choir, left unfinished in 1355.

Sienese painter, some of his paintings were long attributed to his tutor, Taddeo di Bartolo. According to Vasari, although unconfirmed by other sources, he spent a period of time in Florence and had even worked in the Carmine church, where he is said to have painted the main altar (lost). He painted one of the most beautiful panels of the Early Renaissance, the Madonna dell' Umiltà. It is signed and dated 1433 and is one of the earliest truly Masaccesque paintings for which we have a firm date."
1455,DOMENICO DEI CAMMEI,(active c. 1500 in Milan),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/domenico/cammei/biograph.html,"
Italian gem engraver. Vasari in the 1568 edition of his Lives wrote of a group of artists who engraved cameos and gems, and he cited specifically one Domenico dei Cammei (Domenico of the Cameos), a Milanese, who made a portrait of Duke Ludovico il Moro in intaglio on a ruby."
1456,DOMENICO DA CORTONA,"(b. ca. 1470, Cortona, d. ca. 1549, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/domenico/cortona/biograph.html,"
Italian woodworker and architect, active in France. He was apparently the son of a goldsmith from Cortona nicknamed Beccaloro, a nickname he inherited and which was changed in France to Boccador. In 1495 he was among the 22 artists and artisans brought from Naples by Charles VIII, King of France, which suggests that he was one of the Tuscans who had settled in Naples in the service of the house of Aragon. A tradition preserved in Cortona in the 18th century maintained that he was trained by Giuliano da Sangallo."

Italian painter. He took his name from his teacher, a carver in bone and ivory named Michelino. He was elected to the Compagnia di S Luca in 1442 and joined the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali on 26 October 1444. In 1459 he received payment from Lorenzo Pucci for a processional banner (untraced) for a confraternity based in S Francesco, Cortona. Four years later he was paid for some figures of saints (untraced) for a cupboard belonging to the Compagnia di S Maria della Purificazione e di S Zanobi, a Florentine confraternity of which he had been a member since 1445."
1458,DOMENICO DI PARIS,(active 1443-1501 in Ferrara),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/domenico/paris/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, bronze-caster and wood-carver. A pupil and son-in-law of Niccolò Baroncelli, he followed his master from Padua to Ferrara. That he was called 'Domenico del Cavallo' in later documents attests to his considerable role in the making of the bronze equestrian monument to Niccolò III d'Este, Marchese of Ferrara (destroyed 1796), which was begun by Baroncelli in 1443 and dedicated on 2 June 1451."

Domenico da Tolmezzo (also referred to as Domenico Mioni, or Dominico di Candido), Italian painter and sculptor (wood carver). He is considered as the leader of the Tolmezzo School, a large group of artists from Friuli active in the second half of the fifteenth century. They combined the Renaissance innovations in Veneto with the influences of Venetian Gothic. An example of this style is the St Lucy Altarpiece (Galleria d'Arte Antica, Udine)."

Hungarian painter. He learnt to paint at M. Meytens, V. Fischer and Sambach in Prague and Vienna. First he lived in Vienna and painted portraits. He moved to Pest in 1810 and painted some remarkable classicist portraits, e.g. Ferenc Kazinczy (1812) and Benedek Virág (1815). His mythological compositions (Resting Venus, Orpheus and Euridike,  and Proserpina) after English copper engravings and altar-pieces were mostly inferior to his portraits.

Dutch painter. We have very little documentary information about this painter, active in Amsterdam. He was a portraitist and genre painter, and his distinctive style of painting and a significant body of published prints reveal a recognizable artistic personality. His works reflect the influence of Thomas de Keyser.

Dorffmeister (Dorfmeister or Dorffmaister) István was a Hungarian painter of Austrian origin. He was a student of the Vienna Academy where he learnt his trade between 1751 and 1759. In 1760, at a very tender age he worked under Maulbertsch in Kromériz. In 1761 he was already in Hungary (Türje, murals in the Premonstratensian church). In 1762 he settled down in Sopron and worked until his death 35 years later almost exclusively for Hungarian patrons. Working in the tradition of Troger's school, he was the most prolific master of Hungarian Baroque painting, indeed the second most popular Baroque painter in the country after Maulbertsch. However, while Maulbertsch's primary patrons were leading members of the Hungarian clergy, Dorffmeister took commissions from everyone ranging from bishops through different monastic orders to town and village communities."

Louis Dorigny, part of a French family of painters, draughtsmen and printmakers. Michel Dorigny (1616-1665) was one of the principal collaborators with Simon Vouet and probably the best engraver of his works. After Vouet's death, he became an independent painter of considerable reputation. Had he not died at a relatively young age, he might have rivalled Charles Le Brun as an important history and decorative painter during the reign of Louis XIV. His sons Louis Dorigny and Nicolas Dorigny (1658-1746) were also painters and printmakers."

He served his apprenticeship with Georges Lallemant and from 1638 was associated with Simon Vouet, in the following decade making etchings after about 80 of his works (e.g. ceiling paintings for the chapel of the Hôtel Séguier, Paris). He was also active as a painter and was one of Vouet's principal collaborators on his altarpieces and decorative schemes (e.g. staircase of the Hôtel Hesselin, Paris) until the death of the Premier Peintre in 1649. The previous year he had married Vouet's second daughter."

Dosso Dossi and his less talented younger brother Battista Dossi were the leading painters at the court of Ferrara under Alfonso I d'Este and Ercole II d'Este. Their father was a native of the Trentino who became bursar at the court of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara and whose property, the Villa Dossi in the province of Mantua, gave the brothers their surname. Their activities were typical of Renaissance court artists: decorating palazzi and villas with frescoes and canvases, usually on mythological or poetic themes; providing designs for tapestries, theatre sets, festival decorations, banners, coins and tableware; painting portraits and small-scale devotional works; gilding their employer's furniture and decorating and varnishing carriages and barges. Most of this work, mentioned in ducal records, is now lost. They also painted altarpieces and, when permitted to do so by the Duke of Ferrara, larger decorative projects for other patrons."

Gerrit (also spelled Gerard) Dou, Dutch painter. In 1628 he became the first pupil of the young Rembrandt, basing his early work closely on his master's. After Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, Dou developed a style of his own, painting usually on a small scale, with a surface of almost enamelled smoothness. He was astonishingly fastidious about his tools and working conditions, with a particular horror of dust. Some of his pictures were painted with the aid of a magnifying glass."
1480,"DOUFFET, Gérard","(b. 1594, Liège, d. 1660, Liège)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/douffet/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was trained in Liège in the late Mannerist tradition of Jean Taulier. He is said to have worked in Rubens's studio in Antwerp in 1612-14, but this seems very doubtful since a painting dated 1615 is quite unlike Rubens. A 'Gerardo Fiammingo' is recorded in Rome between 1615 and 1623, who cannot be identified as either Gerrit van Honthorst or Gerard Seghers, since both had already returned north, it is thought therefore that this might be a reference to Douffet. He must have moved in the circles of Bartolomeo Manfredi and Nicolas Tournier and known other northern artists in the city such as Dirck van Baburen and David de Haen. He can be documented with certainty in Valentin de Boulogne's studio in 1620-22 and it has been suggested that the two artists collaborated on the Taking of Christ with the Malchus Episode at around this time."

This circle was active in the first half of the sixteenth century in Kalkar, a town in the Lower Rhine region of Germany near the Dutch border (near Kleve). His masterpiece, the Seven Sorrows Altarpiece in the church in Kalkar was executed in 1518-22. Although he worked with tough, unyielding oak, he achieved spacial effects that really can only be created in limewood and other softer kinds of works.

He left for a period of study in Italy and was in Rome with Joseph Wright of Derby from 1773 to 1774. When he next exhibited at the Royal Academy (1777) he was living in Cambridge, but from 1778 to 1804 his considerable annual contribution to the Academy exhibitions was sent from various London addresses."

In 1752 he arrived to complete his artistic education at the Académie de France in Rome, where he discovered the art of Raphael and of Domenichino, as well as that of such Baroque masters as Pietro da Cortona, Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena. He also stayed in Parma and visited Venice, Bologna and Turin. His experiences in Italy confirmed him in his lifelong vocation for large-scale history painting."

German sculptor. He came to Berlin in October 1827 and trained in the studio of Christian Daniel Rauch who influenced him greatly for many years, and at the Königliche Akademie der Künste. In early works such as the marble relief based on Goethe's Fifth Roman Elegy (1832; Heidelberg, private collection) and the marble and bronze group Nymph Catching a Butterfly (1837-9; Luxembourg, Palais Grand-Ducal) he shows his preference for themes that connect him with ancient art and the German art of the 16th century. The style of these works is, to a large extent, drawn from works by Rauch, although Drake lent his portrayals a genre character and softened classical strictness with gentler modelling and an emphasis on expression."

His early works reflects the influence of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger and the Flemish David Vinckboons. He continued the tradition of Flemish landscape painting. He was the teacher of his son, Cornelis Droochsloot (1630-1673)and Jacob Duck.


"
1493,"DROST, Willem","(b. ca. 1630, Germany, d. after 1680, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/drost/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman and printmaker, possibly of German origin. Almost nothing is known of his life, and only half a dozen paintings (and an even smaller number of etchings) are recognized as being by him. According to Houbraken, he was a pupil of Rembrandt, possibly in or shortly before 1650. All the works that are dated are of the 1650s, and it would seem that at this time Drost was one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented followers. His earliest dated paintings are two pendants of 1653: the Portrait of a Man (New York, Metropolitan Museum) and the Portrait of a Woman (The Hague, Museum Bredius). An early etching signed w drost 1652 is probably a self-portrait, in which Drost portrayed himself as a young man drawing. His Portrait of a Young Man in the Wallace Collection, London, bears a false Rembrandt signature.



"
1494,"DROUAIS, François-Hubert","(b. 1727, Paris, d. 1775, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/drouais/francois/biograph.html,"
French portrait painter. He trained under Boucher (among others) and became a rival to Nattier as a fashionable portraitist. His portraits have a gracious and artificial charm and at their best bear comparison with those of Boucher. He was particularly successful with children, but his best known painting is probably the very grand portrait of Mme Pompadour in the National Gallery, London (1763-64), completed after the sitter's death. His father, Hubert (1699-1767) and his son, Germain (1763-1788) were painters.



"
1495,"DROUAIS, Jean-Germain","(b. 1763, Paris, d. 1788, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/drouais/jeangerm/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of painters. His father, Francois Hubert Drouais, and his grandfather, Hubert Drouais, were well-known portrait painters; and it was from his father that he received his first artistic instruction. In 1778 enrolled at the Académie Royale, becoming a pupil of Nicolas-Guy Brenet. Around 1781 he entered Jacques-Louis David's studio as one of his first pupils. The following year, though not officially entered for the competition, he painted that year's Prix de Rome subject, the Return of the Prodigal Son (Paris, St Roch), presumably as a trial for his own edification. The picture has a friezelike composition and reveals both the influence of Jean-François Peyron and David as well as debts to Poussin and Italian 17th-century sources."
1496,"DROUOT, Edouard","(b. 1859, Sommevoire, d. 1945, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/drouot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. Early in his career, Drouot was a successful painter, in addition to his sculpture, receiving an honourable mention at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1900. Drouot studied in Paris under Emile Thomas (1817-1882), a sculptor who received numerous state commissions and produced portraits, monuments, allegorical and mythological works in marble and bronze. Drouot also studied under Mathurin Moreau, one of the renowned family of sculptors in bronze and marble. "
1497,"DU BROEUCQ, Jacques","(d. ca. 1505, Mons, d. 1584, Mons)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/du_broeu/biograph.html,"
Jacques Du Broeucq (or Dubroeucq), Flemish sculptor and architect. He is considered as one of the most important Renaissance artists in the Southern Netherlands. He is known as the teacher of Giambologna in Antwerp."
1498,"DUBBELS, Hendrik Jakobsz.","(b. 1621, Amsterdam, d. 1707, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubbels/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He worked in Amsterdam as a painter of seascapes and winter landscapes from c. 1641 until his death. He also did chalk and ink drawings of the same subjects. His earliest paintings were seascapes executed in the style of Jan Porcellis and using the restricted palette associated with the 'tonal' phase of Dutch painting. From c. 1650 to 1653 Dubbels was employed in the studio of Simon de Vlieger, where he developed close artistic contacts with Jan van de Capelle and Willem van de Velde II, and de Vlieger's influence can be seen in the scenes of Amsterdam and its environs that Dubbels painted independently until c. 1658-60. He worked mainly for other Amsterdam marine painters: he was in the studio of Willem van de Velde I until 1672-3, when van de Velde and his son emigrated to England. After that Dubbels worked with his former pupil, Ludolf Backhuysen.


"
1499,"DUBOIS, Jacques","(b. 1694, Pontoise, d. 1763, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubois/jacques/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker. He was a descendant of a family of French ébénistes, probably learned the craft in the workshop of his half-brother, Nöel Gérard, an important cabinetmaker and dealer of the 1720s and 1730s."
1500,"DUBOIS, René","(b. 1737, Paris, d. 1799, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubois/rene/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker. René Dubois followed his father Jacques Dubois, becoming a master ébéniste when he was only eighteen years old. He continued to work for his father, using his father's stamp of I DUBOIS, and directed the family workshop with his mother after Jacques's death in 1763. Nine years later Dubois's mother relinquished control of the workshop, selling the existing stock to her son, who agreed to pay her an annuity."
1501,"DUBOIS, Ambroise","(b. ca. 1542, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1614, Fontainebleau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubois_a/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in France. He was one of the painters of the Second Fontainebleau school. By 1595 (and possibly earlier) he was established at Fontainebleau, where he contributed to the decoration of the Galerie d'Ulysse (destroyed) and the Galerie de Diane (constructed 1600, destroyed 1810); fragments of the latter have been incorporated into the Galerie des Assiettes. In 1606 he embarked on the decoration of the Queen's apartment (destroyed) for Marie de' Medici. The first book that the Queen was said to have read in French was a version of the story of Tancredi and Clorinda from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberate, and the apartment was decorated with episodes from this romance; the heroic portrayal of the warrior woman Clorinda must have been congenial to the Queen. The surviving pictures are now divided between Fontainebleau and the Musée du Louvre. Dubois also decorated the Oval Chamber (now the Salon Louis XIII) with scenes from the story of Theagenes and Chariclea from the Aethiopica of Heliodorus.



"
1502,"DUBOIS, Paul","(b. 1829, Nogent-sur-Seine, d. 1905, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubois_p/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter. He studied law and art. After his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts he went to Rome and in 1860 he first contributed busts to the Salon in Paris. For his first exhibited statues, The Infant St John the Baptist and Narcissus at the Bath (1863), he was awarded a medal of the second class. His statue of the Infant St John was bought by the Musée de Luxembourg. A Florentine Singer of the Fifteenth Century (depicted in doublet and hose playing a lute), for a time one of the most reproduced statuettes in Europe, was shown in 1865. The Virgin and Child was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in France in 1867. The Birth of Eve was produced in 1873, and was followed by striking busts of Jean-Jacques Henner, Dr Parrot, Paul Baudry, Louis Pasteur, Charles Gounod and Léon Bonnat, remarkable alike for life, vivacity, likeness, refinement and subtle handling."
1503,"DUBOIS-DRAHONET, Alexandre-Jean","(b. 1791, Paris, d. 1829, Versailles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duboisdr/biograph.html,"
French painter. Born and raised in Paris, Alexandre Dubois-Drahonet was a student and disciple of Neo-classical French master, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and first exhibited at the Salon in 1822. The young artist painted the future Queen of England (Queen Victoria) when a girl, commissioned by William IV in 1832 as part of a much larger commission of some ninety portraits of officers and soldiers in uniform (now in the Royal Collection, Windsor). It was part of the commission to paint a series of pictures illustrating recent changes in the uniforms and weapons of the British Army."
1504,"DUBOIS-PILLET, Albert","(b. 1846, Paris, d. 1890, Le Puy-en-Velay)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duboispi/biograph.html,"
French painter and army officer. (His real name: Albert Dubois.) He pursued a military career at the Ecole Impériale Militaire at Saint-Cyr, from which he graduated in 1867. He fought in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and was held prisoner in Westphalia by the Germans; upon release he joined the Versailles army and participated in the suppression of the Commune. Following various assignments in the provinces, in late 1879 he was appointed to the Légion de la Garde Républicaine in Paris."
1505,"DUBORDIEU, Pieter","(b. ca. 1609, l'Île-Bouchard, d. 1678, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubordie/biograph.html,"
Pieter Dubordieu (also Pieter du Bordieu), Dutch painter, active mainly in Leiden. He was born in l'Isle de Bouchard, France, and apparently received his training there. He was doubtless trained in the tradition of his day, a combination of minute Flemish realism with a feeling for decorative colour characteristic of the French court style in the sixteenth century."
1506,"DUBOS, Marie-Jeanne Renard","(b. 1701, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubos/biograph.html,"
Marie-Jeanne Renard Dubos was a French graphic artist, pupil of Charles Dupuis (1685-1742). She worked in Paris, and was one of the few women engravers of the time. She executed several prints for the book Versailles immortalisée, published in 1720.



"
1507,"DUBREUIL, Toussaint","(b. ca. 1561, Paris, d. 1602, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubreuil/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. He was a pupil at Fontainebleau of Ruggiero de Ruggieri (d. after 1597) and was also trained by Martin Fréminet's father, a rather mediocre painter in Paris. Dubreuil became Premier Peintre to Henry IV and is usually identified as a member of the so-called second Fontainebleau school, together with Ambroise Dubois and Martin Fréminet. These artists were employed by the king to decorate the royal palaces, their functions being similar to those of Rosso Fiorentino and Primaticcio earlier at Fontainebleau under Francis I. Dubreuil's death meant that many of the projects in which he was involved had to be completed by assistants. Despite this and the fact that the majority of his finished work has since been lost, he is considered an important link between the Mannerism of Primaticcio and the classicism of Nicolas Poussin and his contemporaries in the following century.



"
1508,"DUBUCAND, Alfred","(b. 1828, Paris, d. 1894, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubucand/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was a proficient Animalier sculptor producing well modeled groups of animals and equestrian subjects. Dubucand studied art under Justin Marie Lequien (1796-1881) and was also a student of the master, Antoine-Louis Barye."
1509,"DUBUFE, Claude-Marie","(b. 1790, Paris, d. 1864, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubufe/claude/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of artists, father of Edouard Dubufe. His father, a chef d'institution, educated him for a career in the diplomatic service. At the age of 19 he was nominated vice-consul and was on the point of leaving for America when David (who had given Dubufe some instruction) persuaded his father to allow him to train as a painter. Dubufe received no further support from his father and paid for his lessons with David by playing the violin in an orchestra. He made his Salon début in 1810 with A Roman Allowing his Family to Die of Hunger rather than Touch a Sum of Money Entrusted to his Keeping; like Achilles Protecting Iphigenia (Salon of 1812) and Christ Calming the Tempest (Salon of 1819), this picture has disappeared."
1510,"DUBUFE, Edouard","(b. 1820, Paris, d. 1883, Versailles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dubufe/edouard/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of artists, son of Claude-Marie Dubufe. He was trained by his father and then by Paul Delaroche. He first appeared at the Salon in 1839 with the Annunciation, a Huntress and a portrait, winning a third class medal. He followed this in 1840 with an episode in the life of St Elisabeth of Hungary, which won him a second class medal; in 1844 he won a first class medal with Bathsheba and a genre scene set in the 15th century (all untraced). Until the 1840s, he painted primarily historical and biblical scenes, then switched to portrait painting.



"
1511,"DUCA, Giacomo del","(b. ca. 1520, Cefalù, d. 1604, Cefalù)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duca/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, architect, bronze-caster and garden designer. He was part of an Italian family of artists. Of Sicilian origin, they were active in Central Italy, mainly in Rome, in the second half of the 16th century."
1512,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,"(b. ca. 1255, d. 1319, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duccio/biograph.html,"
Duccio di Buoninsegna was the first great Sienese painter, and he stands in relation to the Sienese School as Giotto does to the Florentine; yet without the powerful naturalism that makes the art of Giotto so revolutionary. Rather, Duccio sums up the grave and austere beauty of centuries of Byzantine tradition and infuses it with a breath of the new humanity which was being spread by the new Orders of SS. Francis and Dominic."
1513,"DUCHÉ DE VANCY, Gaspard",(1756-1788),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duche/biograph.html,"
French painter who is noted for his images of the voyage of exploration of Jean-Francois Galaup, comte de La Perouse in the late 18th century. After studying art in Vienna, Duché de Vancy exhibited in Paris and at the Royal Academy in London. He went on to complete portraits of European royalty and architectural views of Naples and Rome.
 
As official artist Gaspard Duche de Vancy recorded the French voyage of explorer Jean Francois Galaup de la Pérouse, from 1785 to 1788. In 1786 he was the first professional artist known to have painted a view of California. He vanished with the expedition in Oceania in 1788.



"
1514,"DUCK, Jacob","(b. ca. 1600, Utrecht, d. after 1660, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher. He was long confused with Jan le Ducq (1629/30–76). In 1621 he was listed as an apprentice portrait painter in the records of the Utrecht Guild of St Luke. His teacher was probably Joost Cornelisz. Droochsloot (1586–1666). The St Job's Hospital in Utrecht acquired a Musical Company by him in 1629. By 1630–32 he was a master in the guild. Like Pieter Codde, he painted guardroom scenes, in which the figures and their interactions are apparently full of underlying symbolic meaning. He also painted merry companies (e.g. c. 1630; Nîmes, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and domestic activities, such as Woman Ironing (Utrecht, Central Museum), employing motifs perhaps symbolic of domestic virtue. He placed his figures in high, bare interiors in which the deep local colours of the foreground stand out well against the cool, greyish-brown background. Only a few of his etchings are known, depicting figures in contemporary dress. Between 1631 and 1649 Duck's presence is documented in Utrecht, Haarlem and Wijk bij Duurstede. Afterwards, and probably by 1656, he was living in The Hague. He was buried at the monastery of St Mary Magdalene in Utrecht.


"
1515,"DUCQ, Joseph-François","(b. 1762, Ledegem, d. 1829, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/ducq/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. Having a natural gift for drawing, he studied at the Academy of Bruges with Paul De Cock [1724-1801] and obtained a first prize in 1786. He left for Paris to study with Joseph-Benoît Suvée. During the Revolution he returned to Bruges in 1792 where he became a member of the local Jacobin Club and played a political role during the last days of the first French occupation. He returned to Paris and received a second Prize of Rome in 1800. He stayed in Rome from 1807 to 1813 and became there the official painter at the court of Eugène de Beauharnais, the viceroy of Italy. After another stay in Paris (1813-15) he settled in Bruges where he was named director of the Academy of Painting. He was also the court painter at the court of William I."
1516,"DUCREUX, Rose-Adélaide","(b. 1761, Paris, d. 1802, Santo Domingo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/ducreux/biograph.html,"
French painter and musician. She was the eldest daughter of the well-known portraitist Joseph Ducreux (1735-1802), principal portraitist to Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), who had traveled to the Queen's native Vienna to paint her in 1769. Rose-Adélaide studied with her father. Since they were not members of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, both Joseph Ducreux and his daughter were excluded from the official Salon until 1791, when the doors were opened to all."
1517,"DUFRESNOY, Charles Alphonse","(b. 1611, Paris, d. 1668, Villiers-le-Bel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dufresno/biograph.html,"
French painter and poet. He was a pupil of Vouet and Perrier. In 1633 he moved to Rome, where he executed architectural paintings. Twenty years later he left Rome for Venice, where he studied the Venetian masters. In 1656, having returned to Paris, he was commissioned by Sanguin to decorate the church at Raincy. He subsequently died of paralysis."
1518,"DUGHET, Gaspard","(b. 1615, Roma, d. 1675, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dughet/biograph.html,"French landscape painter, draughtsman, and etcher, born of French parents and active in Rome (called also Gaspard Poussin). He is one of the most difficult seventeenth-century artists to identify and define, even though he achieved success in his lifetime and his pictures continued to be in demand for two centuries after his death. He became associated with Nicolas Poussin (whose surname he adopted) at an early age because Poussin married Gaspard's sister, Anne-Marie Dughet, in 1630. It is assumed that Gaspard was taught to paint by his illustrious brother-in-law in the early 1630s, in spite of the fact that Poussin at that time was totally preoccupied with mythological and religious subject-matter, and had not turned his attention to landscapes. It is likely, therefore, as nothing but landscapes survive from Gaspard's hand, that he was the initiator of the classical landscape painting. These earliest essays may well be the group of pictures formerly put together as The Silver Birch Master, although there is now a theory that these works represent Poussin's earliest landscapes.

1519,"DUGONI, Antonio","(b. 1827, Cividale, d. 1874, Friuli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dugoni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born in a poor family. He began his studies in 1841 in Udine, then he attended for four years the Academy in Venice where he was a pupil of Ludovico Lipparini, Michelangelo Grigoletti (1801-1870) and Odorico Politi (1785-1846)."
1520,"DUJARDIN, Karel","(b. 1622, Amsterdam, d. 1678, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dujardin/biograph.html,"
Dutch Romanist painter and etcher, best known for his spirited representations of Italian peasants and shepherds with their animals. Karel Dujardin was baptised in the Lutheran Church in Amsterdam on 27 September 1626. He was the son of the candlemaker ('smeersmelter') Charel Dujardin and Cathalyne Borckhout. Houbraken reported that he was a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem."

Dumonstier (also spelt Du Monstier; Dumontier; Dumoustier; Du Moustier] was a French family of artists. At least 11 artists of this name are known, working variously as painters, draughtsmen, designers, goldsmiths and sculptors, and active from the 16th century to the 18th. The exact relationships of some family members are difficult to determine; these include Cosme Dumonstier I (d. 1552), a goldsmith known to have worked for Rouen Cathedral; Étienne Dumonstier I (fl. Rouen, c. 1501), an illuminator working at the château of Gaillon for Cardinal Georges d'Amboise; Cardin (or Carentin) Dumonstier, a sculptor mentioned in the accounts of the Bâtiments du Roi from 1540 to 1550; and Charles Dumonstier, active in the mid-18th century as a painter and engraver: his works include portraits of Louis XV and Marie Leczinska (Paris, Louvre). The main branch of the family began with the painter and illuminator Jean Dumonstier (d. c. 1535), whose son Geoffroy Dumonstier (c. 1510-1573) followed his profession. Another son, Meston Dumonstier (fl. c. 1535), was a goldsmith in Rouen. Geoffroy's sons Étienne Dumonstier II (c. 1540-1603), Pierre Dumonstier I and Cosme Dumonstier II (c. 1545-1605), as well as Cosme and Etienne's respective sons, Daniel Dumonstier and Pierre Dumonstier II (c. 1585-1656), are best known as portrait draughtsmen working for the French court. Daniel's sons Etienne III and Nicolas were also artists. The last member of this branch was Nicolas's son Louis Dumonstier (b. 1641), a mediocre reproductive engraver."

The first in a long line of sculptors was Pierre Dumont (d. 1737), who was a member of the Accademia di S Luca, Rome, and sculptor to Leopold, Duke of Lorraine (reg 1697-1729), for whom he provided decorative work in, among other places, Nancy (1719; destroyed). The career of his son François Dumont, was cut short by a tragic accident. François's son Edme Dumont, grandson Jacques-Edme Dumont and great-grandson Augustin-Alexandre Dumont were all winners of the Prix de Rome for sculpture."
1525,"DUMONT, Jacques","(b. 1701, Paris, d. 1781, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dumont/jacques/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker, part of the Dumont family of artists (mainly aculptors). He was the son of Pierre Dumont (died c. 1737),  a court sculptor to the duke of Lorraine, and the brother of the sculptor François Dumont. He was called ""le Romain"" from his youthful residence at Rome."
1526,"DUMONT, François","(b. 1751, Lunéville, d. 1831, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dumont_f/biograph.html,"
French miniature painter. He was left an orphan when quite young, with five brothers and sisters to support. He was for a while a student under Jean Girardet, and then set up a studio for himself. In 1784 he journeyed to Rome, returning after four years careful study, and in 1788 was accepted as an Academician and granted an apartment in the Louvre. He married the daughter of Antoine Vestier, the miniature painter, and had two sons, Aristide and Bias, both of whom became painters."
1527,"DUNOUY, Alexandre Hyacinthe","(b. 1757, Paris, d. 1841, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dunouy/biograph.html,"
French painter. Relatively little is known about the early career of Dunouy, as we cannot be sure in whose studio he learnt his art. In 1781 he exhibited a landscape, otherwise unidentified, at the Exposition de la Jeunesse, and it is evident he found the means to travel to Italy early, as in 1787 he showed a View of San Cosinata at the Salon de l'Élysée. His finished works suggest the influence of Hackert, whom he may have encountered in Naples, and we may assume that he was exposed to the work of Valenciennes."
1528,"DUPÉRAC, Etienne","(b. ca. 1525, Bordeaux, d. 1601, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duperac/biograph.html,"
French painter, engraver and garden designer. He went to Rome in 1550 and stayed there for over 20 years, soon becoming acknowledged as a first-rate engraver and designer. His work provides an invaluable record of later 16th-century Rome, telling much about the state of the ancient ruins, contemporary architecture and urban planning, especially the work of Michelangelo. Many of Dupérac's engravings were published by Antoine Lafréry. Those depicting the work of Michelangelo were published in 1569 after the latter's death (1564); they give a useful insight into Michelangelo's original, unrealized intentions for such projects in Rome as the Capitoline Hill and St Peter's. It has been shown that Dupérac designed and painted part of the decoration of the loggia of Pope Pius IV in the Vatican."

Duplessis was a French painter who studied with Subleyras in Rome 1745-49. Returning to France he pursued a career as portraitist in Paris, while retaining close links to his home town of Carpentras. After 1774 Duplessis won favour at the court of the new king, Louis XVI, and painted portraits of the entire royal family, as well as of Gluck (1775, Vienna) and Benjamin Franklin (1779). While in Paris, he dispatched altar paintings to the cathedral of Carpentras, as well as decorative landscape paintings to the local hospital. He retired to Carpentras from 1792 to 1796.

1530,"DUPRÉ, Giovanni","(b. 1817, Siena, d. 1882, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupre/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and writer. He was among the foremost sculptors in Tuscany in the generation after Lorenzo Bartolini. His early experiments in naturalism attracted such hostile criticism that he was forced to abandon this style in favour of a sensual neo-Greek manner. His later works are marked by a richly expressive eclecticism.



"
1531,"DUPRÉ, Jules","(b. 1811, Nantes, d. 1889, L'Isle-Adam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupre_j/biograph.html,"
French painter, one of the chief members of the Barbizon school of landscape painters. If Corot stands for the lyric and Rousseau for the epic aspect of the poetry of nature, Dupré is the exponent of her tragic and dramatic aspects."
1532,"DUPRÉ, Julien","(b. 1851, Paris, d. 1910, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupre_ju/biograph.html,"
French painter. He devoted his artistic career to the depiction of French peasant women, and he is regarded as the closest follower of Jules Breton. He received his academic training from renowned artists such as Isidore Pils, Henri Lehmann and Desire-Francois Laugée (1823-1896)."
1533,"DUPRÉ, Louis","(b. 1789, Versailles, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupre_l/biograph.html,"
French painter, especially noted for his travels in Greece and the Ottoman Empire and his numerous paintings with Orientalist and Philhellene themes. He became the official painter to Jérôme Bonaparte in Kassel (Westphalia) in 1811. In this capacity he received a pension to stay in Italy, then to discover Greece and Constantinople, where he stayed between February and September 1819."
1534,"DUPUIS, Nicolas-Gabriel","(b. ca. 1698, Paris, d. 1771, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupuis/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He was the younger brother of the engraver Charles Dupuis (1685-1742). He first worked as a dyer and for many years engraved plates of ornaments intended for printing on silk. With his brother he worked in the workshop of Gaspard Duchange, whose daughter he married in 1737; he collaborated with his master in the execution of several large works, including the Coronation of Louis XV); parts of Raphael's cartoons of the Acts of the Apostles (London, Hampton Court, Royal Collection); and Jean de La Fontaine's Fables after Jean-Baptiste Oudry."
1535,"DUPUYS, Pierre","(b. 1610, Montfort l'Amaury, d. 1682, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dupuys/biograph.html,"
French painter. All of his dated pictures are from the second part of his career, and indicate by their style that he was deeply influenced by his contemporary Louise Moillon, though his pictures are usually a little less precise and crisp than that celebrated painter's work. Three of his pictures were recorded in the seventeenth century in the collection of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm at Brussels. Dupuys was received into the French Academy in Paris in 1663.



"
1536,"DUQUE CORNEJO, Pedro","(b. 1678, Sevilla, d. 1757, Córdoba)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duque/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor and painter. He was the disciple of his grandfather Pedro Roldán. He was born in Seville and worked mostly in his home city (church of the Sagrario, Palace of San Telmo and the local Cathedral), He worked also in Granada and Madrid (statues in Santa Maria de El Paular, after 1725). In Córdoba he executed the choir at the Mosque-cathedral.



"
1537,"DUQUESNOY, Francois","(b. 1597, Bruxelles, d. 1643, Livorno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duquesno/francois/biograph.html,"Flemish sculptor, active mainly in Roma where he settled in 1618. He was a friend of Poussin. sharing a house with him for some time, and became a leading figure in circle devoted to classical art. Alongside Algardi he came to be recognized as the outstanding sculptor in Rome after the great Bernini (who employed him on the decoration of the Baldacchino in St Peter's in 1627-8). and as with Algardi, his style was much more restrained and less Baroque than Bernini's.

"
1538,"DUQUESNOY, Jérôme, the Elder","(b. ca. 1570, Le Quesnoy, d. 1641, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duquesno/jerome1/biograph.html,"
Jérome Duquesnoy the Elder (or Hieronymous Duquesnoy I) was a Flemish sculptor who played a large part in the artistic revival in the Southern Netherlands following the religious and iconoclastic disturbances of the 16th century. Documentary sources show that he was busily engaged and charged with sculptural commissions for all the major churches as well as for government buildings. None of this has survived. His style has to be judged mainly by the work he did outside Brussels, notably the marble tabernacle in Sint-Martinuskerk in Aalst."
1539,"DUQUESNOY, Jérôme, the Younger","(b. 1602, Brussel, d. 1654, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duquesno/jerome2/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor and architect, son of Jérôme Duquesnoy the Elder. He was trained in Brussels by his father. In 1618 he went to Rome to complete his training with his brother François. He separated from the latter as a result of a dispute, and he seems to have traveled to Madrid, Lisbon and Florence. From 1641 to 1643 he worked again in his brother's studio in Rome. After his death, he returned to Brussels where he began a brilliant career. His brother's moderately Baroque works remained a model for him for the rest of his life. Together with Artus Quellinus I and Rombaut Pauwels  (1625-1700), he helped spread this style in the Netherlands."
1540,"DURAMEAU, Louis-Jean-Jacques","(b. 1733, Paris, d. 1796, Versailles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/durameau/biograph.html,"
French painter. The son of a copperplate printer, he worked with the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Defernex before entering the Académie Royale in 1754, where he studied under Jean-Baptiste Pierre. After three unsuccessful attempts he won the Grand Prix de Rome in 1757 with Elijah Raising the Shunammite Woman's Son from the Dead (École des Beaux-Arts, Paris). He studied (1757-60) at the École des Elèves Protégés in Paris under Carle van Loo, afterwards transferring to the Académie de France in Rome."
1541,"DURAND, Asher Brown","(b. 1796, Springfield Township, d. 1886, Maplewood)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/durand/biograph.html,"
American painter and engraver. He played a leading role in formulating both the theory and practice of mid-19th-century American landscape painting and was a central member of the Hudson River School. Five years older than Thomas Cole, he matured considerably later as an artist. After an apprenticeship (1812-17) with Peter Maverick, he began his career as an engraver, attaining eminence with plates after John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence (1820-23) and John Vanderlyn's Ariadne (1835), the latter so accomplished that the chronicler William Dunlap claimed it would win Durand immortality as an engraver. As with many contemporary artists, his training was based on drawing, an experience that influenced his insistence on the importance of outline and precise rendering."
1542,"DURAND-BRAGER, Jean Baptiste Henri","(b. 1814, Dol-de-Bretagne, d. 1879, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/durand_b/biograph.html,"
French painter and photographer. He was an adventurous soul, which was inherited, from his father, the explorer Jean-Baptiste Leonard Durand. He explored the world's reaches and if not for some fateful moments he would have settled into a naval career rather than that of an artist. His repertoire contains scenes from his youthful travels to the coast of Africa, Asia and South America, including being shipwrecked in Senegal. To avoid these traumas and hardships, his father encouraged him to study art, as he had been convinced of his son's great natural talent. He became a painter of naval subjects and he studied under Théodore Gudin after which he entered the atelier of the French painter Eugène Isabey."
1543,"DURANTINO, Guido",(active 1519-1576 in Urbino),https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/durantin/biograph.html,"
Guido Durantino (meaning Guido of Castel Durante) was established as a potter in Urbino by 1519 and by 1553 had adopted the name Fontana. His three sons, Nicolò Fontana (died 1565), Camillo Fontana (died 1589) and Orazio Fontana (c. 1510-1576), also took part in the business, as did Nicolò's son Flaminio Fontana. The workshop was one of the most influential in the area during the 16th century."

French sculptor. Son of a sculptor of the same name (1729-1816) and a pupil of François-Joseph Bosio, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1818 and won the Prix de Rome in 1823. Among his works executed at the Académie de France in Rome is Orestes Mad (marble, c. 1825; Avignon, Musée Calvet), a colossal head modelled after the Antique that is at the same time a self-portrait, and Mercury Inventing the Lyre (marble; destroyed), an elegant statue much praised at the 1831 Salon."
1546,"DUSART, Cornelis","(b. 1660, Haarlem, d. 1704, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dusart/biograph.html,"

Dutch genre painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He was the son of the organist at St Bavo in Haarlem and one of the close friends and last pupils of Adriaen van Ostade. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St Luke on 10 January 1679 and served as its dean in 1692. Dated pictures by Dusart have survived from almost every year between 1679 and 1702. Some of his earliest pictures of peasants relied heavily on compositions by van Ostade. On van Ostade's death Dusart inherited his pictures and completed a number of them.



"
1547,"DUSEIGNEUR, Jehan","(b. 1808, Paris, d. 1866, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duseigne/biograph.html,"
Jehan Duseigneur (also Jean-Bernard du Seigneur), French sculptor. At the age of 14, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, became successively the pupil of François-Joseph Bosio, Louis Dupaty (1771-1825) and Jean-Pierre Cortot (1787-1843). At 16, he was awarded the ""third medal"". The education he received is classic because Bosio was a student of Canova. However, he moves away from the classical school, looking into the Middle Ages for chivalrous and Christian new inspirations. He follows with great interest the anatomy lessons and is attracted to the forms dictated by the nature."
1548,"DUVET, Jean","(b. ca. 1485, Dijon, d. after 1561, Langres)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duvet/biograph.html,"
French goldsmith and engraver. He was the son of Drouhot Duvet, a goldsmith active in Dijon at the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th. He was admitted as a master goldsmith in Dijon in 1509, but most of his career was in Langres. From 1540 onwards he lived in Geneva, where he worked for the city council and might therefore have become a Protestant."
1549,"DUVIVIER, Jan Bernard","(b. 1762, Bruges, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duvivier/biograph.html,"
Bernard Duvivier was a Flemish/French painter of the Neoclassical period, who was born in Bruges, Flanders, but became a celebrated painter in Paris, where he was appointed professor at the Ecole Normale.

1550,"DUYFHUIJSEN, Pieter Jacobsz.","(b. 1608, Rotterdam, d. 1677, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duyfhuij/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, called Colinchovius. In 1625-1627 he may have studied with Johannes Torrentius in Haarlem, otherwise he was active in Rotterdam. He was known as a genre painter, painted peasant genre scenes, farm still-lifes, animal paintings, portraits, and religious subjects.



"
1551,"DUYNEN, Isaac van","(b. 1628, Dordrecht, d. ca. 1680, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duynen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was a painter of still-lifes, particularly of still-lifes of fish and fruit. He was probably the pupil of Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp. He travelled to Rome in 1651-1657. In 1657 on his return to the Netherlands he settled in The Hague and became a member of the Confrerie Pictura in 1665. He was a follower of Pieter van Noort (1602-after 1662) and Jan Davidsz. de Heem.


"
1552,"DUYSTER, Willem Cornelisz.","(b. 1599, Amsterdam, d. 1635, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/duyster/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of genre scenes and portraits, active mainly in his native Amsterdam. Most of his paintings depict soldiers, sometimes in action, but more usually drinking, gaming, or wooing. His delicate skill at painting textiles, his ability to characterize individuals, and his power to express subtle psychological relationships between them, suggest that if he had not been carried off by the plague in his mid 30s he might well have rivalled Terborch.


"
1553,"DYCE, William","(b. 1806, Aberdeen, d. 1864, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dyce/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, scientist and art administrator. He studied in London and Rome where he was influenced by the Nazarenes and he is said to have painted a Madonna in 1828 (now lost), which may have helped to transmit the new German ideas to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded in 1848)."
1554,"DYCK, Sir Anthony Van","(b. 1599, Antwerpen, d. 1641, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/d/dyck_van/biograph.html,"
Sir Anthony van Dyck was a Flemish painter who was one of the most important and prolific portraitists of the 17th century. He is also considered to be one of the most brilliant colourists in the history of art."
1555,"EAKINS, Thomas","(b. 1844, Philadelphia, d. 1916, Philadelphia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eakins/biograph.html,"
American painter, photographer, and sculptor, best known for his precise, exacting paintings in the tradition of the Barbizon School and Velázquez. He studied with Gérome and others in Paris from 1866-1869, but returned to Philadelphia in 1870 where he painted local figures and scenes that emphasized emotional truth and visual fact. He visited Spain, where he was drawn to the works of Velázquez. His interest in science led to probably his best-known painting, The Gross Clinic (1875), showing the famous surgeon in the operating theater. The picture shocked contemporaries with its frank depiction of blood."
1556,"EARL, Ralph","(b. 1751, Shrewsbury, d. 1801, Bolton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/earl/biograph.html,"
American painter, active in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont, and also in England (1778-85), when his loyalty to the British put his life in danger in his homeland. He painted landscapes and battle scenes of the Revolution, but was primarily a portraitist. Although his style became softer and more sophisticated after studying with West in London, his work generally has a sincerity and freshness of vision that makes him one of the finest American artists of the 18th century. His presentation of character is extremely forthright and his portraits convey the immense pride his New England sitters took in their possessions. Earl's personal life was a disaster. He was imprisoned for debt and died an alcoholic after deserting both of his wives in turn. Other members of his family were artists, notably his brother James (1761-96) and his son Ralph E. W. Earl (c. 1785-1838).



"
1557,"EARLOM, Richard","(b. 1743, London, d. 1822, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/earlom/biograph.html,"
English printmaker. Taught by Giovanni Battista Cipriani, he worked in mezzotint, etching and occasionally stipple. His mezzotints of flowers and still-lifes after the Dutch artists Van Os and Jan van Huysum are also found printed in colours or coloured by hand."
1558,"EBERLEIN, Johann Friedrich","(b. 1695, Dresden, d. 1749, Meissen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eberlein/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and modeller, trained in England, active in Meissen where he worked as the first assistant modeller to Johann Joachim Kändler from 1735-1749.  His engagement by the manufactory was directly linked to the production of the animal figures of the ""Japanese Palace"". The influence of Kändler's style is constantly evident in all Eberlein's pieces. Although a talented artist and capable of developing subtle individual nuances in his work, Eberlein can be mainly credited for helping to form a new, unified style at the Meissen manufactory. Owing to his close working relationship with Kändler, it is difficult to separate their work.



"
1559,"EBERLEIN, Gustav Heinrich","(b. 1847, Spiekershausen, d. 1926, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eberleix/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, painter, and poet. He was the son of a border guard. At the age of eight, his family moved to Hannoversch Münden, which would be his home for the remainder of his life, despite many years spent elsewhere. His parents lacked the money to provide him with formal artistic training, so he obtained instruction wherever possible, especially from the local goldsmith. In 1866, thanks to the patronage of a pastor who had recognized his talents, he was able to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Nuremberg. In 1869, he went to Berlin on a scholarship. Three years later, another scholarship enabled him to study in Rome."
1560,"ECKARDT, Christian Frederik Emil","(b. 1832, København, d. 1914, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eckardt/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, active during the Golden Age of Danish art, the period of such Danish thinkers and artists as Hans Christian Andersen, Soren Kierkegaard, and Bertel Thorvaldsen. He became a painter of luminous marine views."
1561,"ECKERSBERG, Christoffer Wilhelm","(b. 1783, Blakrog, d. 1853, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eckersbe/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. After being trained in Copenhagen and studying in Paris (1810-13) under Jacques-Louis David, he continued his studies in Rome (1814), where he executed a masterly portrait of his friend Thorvaldsen (Royal Academy, Copenhagen, 1815). Returning to Copenhagen in 1816, he occupied himself mainly with portraits, minutely rendering the features of his models with a Neoclassic feeling for c1arity and purity of line. He also painted many landscapes, however (as he had done in Rome), and as an influential teacher at the Copenhagen Academy (from 1818) he introduced painting from nature into the curriculum. He also executed some religious themes and subjects from Danish history in Christiansborg Palace."
1562,"EDELFELT, Albert","(b. 1854, Kiala Estate, d. 1905, Haikko)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/edelfelt/biograph.html,"

Pieter van Edingen, known as Van Aelst, Flemish tapestry-maker. He was one of the most famous and outstanding tapestry weavers and dealers in Brussels at the beginning of the 16th century, and he run the most important workshop of his period. He was commissioned by Pope Leo X to execute the tapestry series Acts of the Apostles after the design of Raphael for the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. He also had commissions from the courts of Madrid and Vienna."
1564,"EDLINGER, Johann Georg","(b. 1741, Graz, d. 1819, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/edlinger/biograph.html,"
Johann (Josef) Georg Edlinger was an Austrian portrait painter. He was the son of Josef Edlinger, a gardener, and his wife Therese. His father recognised his creative abilities and he received the first artistic lessons in his home town. In 1752 he became an apprentice of the church painter Embert. At 17 he left the workshop and wandered during the following three years in Austria and Hungary. Then he returned to Graz. In 1765 he went to Vienna and became an assistant in the studio of the painter Tuchmeyer. At the end of 1774 he became a student of the court painter Franz Ignaz Oefele at the Royal School of Drawing in Munich. In 1775 in Munich, Edlinger married Maria Anna Barbara Wels, and they had six children."
1565,"EECKHOUT, Gerbrand van den","(b. 1621, Amsterdam, d. 1674, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eeckhout/biograph.html,"
Dutch biblical, genre, and portrait painter, a gifted and favourite pupil of Rembrandt, to whom he remained a close friend. His usual style is based so closely on that of his master that many of his pictures have passed as works of Rembrandt himself. Eeckhout was one of the most successful of this school in adopting the broader and bolder technique of Rembrandt's mature style, though he seldom approached the master in humanity or depth of feeling."
1566,"EERTVELT, Andries van","(b. 1590, Antwerpen, d. 1652, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eertvelt/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He enrolled as a member of Antwerp's Guild of St Luke in 1609. In 1615 he married Catherine Vlieger (d. 1627), after whose death he went to Genoa, where he worked for Cornelis de Wael. By c. 1630 he was back in Antwerp, where he had his portrait painted by Anthony van Dyck (1632; Schaezlerpalais, Augsburg). In 1633 Eertvelt married Elisabeth Boots, probably a daughter of the Antwerp painter Jan Boots (b. before 1620)."
1567,"EGAS, Enrique, the Elder","(b. ca. 1455, Toledo, d. 1534, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/egas/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect and sculptor, son of the Flemish sculptor Cueman Egas (active c. 1440-1495 in Spain), originating from Brussels. He received his training in Toledo, then worked in the service of the Catholic monarchs.  He (or Pedro Gumiel) was responsible for the creation of the ""Cisneros Style,"" in which Gothic, Renaissance and Mudejar elements are combined."
1568,"EGCKL, Wilhelm","(b. ca. 1512, Augsburg, d. 1588, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/egckl/biograph.html,"
Wilhelm Egckl (also Eckl; Egkl; Eggl; Oegckhl), German architect-builder. He is first recorded (20 June 1558) in Munich, where he was an official of the ducal armoury (Zeugwart). While still occupying this position he was also put in charge of the construction of a ballroom, the Georgssaal (destroyed). When the Georgssaal was completed in 1560, Egckl was appointed Master Builder to Duke Albert V of Bavaria (reg 1550-1579), in control of all building schemes; he evidently held this position until his death, even under Duke William V (reg 1579-1598)."
1569,"EGELL, Johann Paul","(b. 1691, Mannheim, d. 1752, Mannheim)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/egell/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and stuccoist. He was trained by Balthasar Permoser in Dresden and returned to his native city of Mannheim around 1720 to become official sculptor to the electoral court. In this capacity he was involved in furnishing Schloss Schwetzing and the park being built by Elector Charles Philip. His allegorical stucco reliefs on the walls of the monumental staircase are among the most successful creations of early 18th-century German decorative art. Egell also designed and carved furniture for the Schloss."
1570,"EGERI, Carl von","(b. ca. 1510, ?, d. 1562, Zürich)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/egeri/biograph.html,"
Swiss glass-painter and designer. In 1536 he settled in Zurich, where he later represented his guild on the Greater Council and held other civic honours. In 1542 and 1555 he was commissioned to make stained-glass windows for the Rathaus. These constructed a powerful new civic iconography for post-Reformation Zurich. Banner-bearing citizens, with finely detailed armour and portrait heads, are set against abstract patterned grounds, the whole framed in elaborate arches. Appropriate biblical scenes of loyalty to the state (e.g. Judith and Holofernes) fill the corners. Two impressively drawn lions occupy a roundel (1542) surrounded by the arms of the Zurich domains. In a 1557 window (Zurich, Geshaus Schneggen) of similar design, the lions are instead fully Mannerist, with elongated bodies and twisted mouths. Von Egeri evidently adapted his style to the job; in his Muri Abbey windows (1557) St Martin and St George ride tranquil Paolo Uccello horses, while the large figures are set against blue skies surmounting perfectly rendered landscapes."
1571,"EGMONT, Justus van","(b. 1601, Leiden, d. 1674, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/egmont/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and tapestry designer. He was initially a pupil of Caspar van den Hoecke (d. 1648). After a period in Italy, sometime after 1618, he joined the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens. He is one of the few artists whose collaboration with Rubens is documented. He is mentioned several times between 1625 and 1628, for example in 1625, when he was involved in the installation of some of the 44 decorative panels ('the Medici Cycle') commissioned from Rubens in 1622 by Marie de' Medici for the Palais de Luxembourg in Paris. He may also have collaborated in painting some of the panels. In 1628 he became a Master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Immediately afterwards he left for Paris, where he acquired a considerable reputation, not only as a painter but also as a print publisher. In 1648 he was one of the founders of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. After 1649 various Flemish archives mention him again: first in Brussels (until c. 1655) and then in Antwerp, where he settled.

Dutch painter and draughtsman. He was first trained by his father, Jan Ekels the Elder, and from 1774 to 1781 attended the Amsterdam Tekenacademie. He won prizes in the annual competition for life drawing in 1779 and 1781. In 1776 he went to Paris for two years to further his studies before returning to Amsterdam. Possibly influenced by the revival of interest in Dutch 17th-century art, he became a painter of portraits, genre pieces and 'moderne gezelschappen' (modern conversation pieces). In 1783 he travelled along the Rhine in Germany with his friends Daniel Dupré (1752-1817) and Jacques Kuyper (1761-1808), visiting the collections at Düsseldorf and Mannheim. After his return in 1784 he became an active member of the Felix Meritis society.



"
1576,"ELIAERTS, Jan Frans","(b. 1761, Deurne, d. 1848, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eliaerts/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter of still-lifes with flowers and fruit. He studied at the Academy in Antwerp then in Paris where he stayed for longer time. He produced large compositions with fine details using a powerful palette. His works are in the museums of Antwerp and Ghent.



"
1577,"ELIE de BEAUMONT, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1732, Carentan, d. 1786, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elie/biograph.html,"
French lawyer and garden architect, friend of Voltaire. A lawyer in 1752, he joined the Parliament of Normandy before moving to Paris, where he acquired a certain celebrity when he made headlines by publishing his famous memoir to rehabilitate the name of the unfortunate Calas, executed wrongly in 1762."
1578,"ELINGA, Pieter Janssens","(b. 1623, Bruges, d. before 1682, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elinga/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam between 1657-1682. He was known for long as Pieter Janssens. He was specialized in painting interiors similar to those made by Pieter de Hooch. His interiors are calm, the figures are motionless. He painted also many simple still-lifes in the style of Willem Kalf.


"
1579,"ELMES, Harvey Lonsdale","(b. 1814, Chichester, d. 1847, Jamaica)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elmes/biograph.html,"
English architect, son of the architect James Elmes (1782-1862). After serving some time in his father's office, and under a surveyor at Bedford and an architect at Bath, he became partner with his father in 1835, and in the following year he was successful among 86 competitors for a design for St George's Hall, Liverpool. The foundation stone of this building was laid on the 28th of June 1838, but, Elmes being successful in a competition for the Assize Courts in the same city, it was finally decided to include the hall and courts in a single building. In accordance with this idea, Elmes prepared a fresh design, and the work of erection commenced in 1841. The design may have been influenced in part by published works of von Klenze and Schinkel, some of whose monumental buildings Elmes saw during a study-visit in 1842."
1580,"ELSÄSSER, Sigmund",(d. ca. 1587),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elsasser/biograph.html,"
Sigmund Elsässer was a court painter of Archduke Ferdinand II. He recorded pageants, weddings, and other court festivities.



"
1581,"ELSEVIER, Louys Aernoutsz","(b. 1618, Leiden, d. 1675, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elsevier/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of a painter and innkeeper in Leiden. He joined the Leiden guild in 1645. In the same year he married Helena Waelpot, the daughter of a prominent printer in the university town. In 1646 he registered in the painters' guild in Delft, he served as headman in 1669 and 1673. In 1648 the artist, who also dealt in dyes and pigments, bought a house called 'The Blue Dog' just beside the choir of the Oude Kerk in Delft. He was buried in the Oude Kerk in 1675."

"
1583,"ELSNER, Jakob",(c. 1460-1517),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/elsner/biograph.html,"
German painter and illuminator. He began his training in the Upper Rhine, near Konstanz, and settled in Nuremberg, apparently establishing his reputation as a portrait painter by 1490. Several portraits have been attributed to him. In each of these rather broadly painted portraits the physiognomy is boldly articulated. There is an application of unblended highlights near the eye at the left, and the tip of the nose, and outlining the lips. The eyes are prominent, wide lower lips, the chin is modeled with broad strokes of light and dark paint, and the neck shows strong tonal contrasts."
1584,"EMBRIACHI, Baldassare degli",(active 1390-1409 in Florence and Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/embriach/biograph.html,"
Italian carver, part of a family of entrepreneurs and carvers. The precise location and the organization of the workshop is unknown, although c. 1431 there was evidently a workshop in Venice, in the area of S Luca, where various members of the family are recorded. The family had links with Florence until the end of the 15th century, particularly with the church of S Maria Novella, where Baldassare Embriachi was recorded as a benefactor, and where his descendant Lorenzo d'Antonio di Messer Manfredi degli Embriachi was buried in 1483.



"
1585,"ENDEN, Maarten van","(b. 1605, Antwerpen, d. 1673, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/enden/biograph.html,"
Flemish printmaker and publisher in Antwerp. In 1630 he became a member of the Guild of Antwerp. He was the first publisher of Van Dyck's Iconography. He was an important figure in Antwerp until the mid 1650s. His brother-in-law was Pieter de Jode II. His brother was a doctor.



"
1586,"ENDER, Johann","(b. 1793, Wien, d. 1854, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/ender/johann/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter who learnt to paint at the Academy in Vienna. First, he painted pictures on historic subject matters, later, on Isabey's influence, he began to paint miniature pictures. He accompanied the Hungarian Count Széchenyi on his trips to Greece and Italy. He was a teacher of the Art Academy in Vienna. He painted Civilization of Hungary for the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He painted altar pictures, too. Eduard and Thomas, his two sons, were painters, too.



"
1587,"ENDER, Thomas","(b. 1793, Wien, d. 1875, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/ender/thomas/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. Johann Thomas Ender and his twin brother Johann Nepomuk were born into a Silesian family in Vienna. In 1806 both enrolled in the St-Anne Academy of Fine Arts. From 1810 Thomas studied under the renowned watercolourist Laurenz Janscha. It was here that he started to paint landscapes in the open air. In 1817 his landscapes won the Emperor's gold medal, which in turn earned him the patronage of Prince Metternich. In 1817-1818 he became a draughtsman of the Austrian scientific expedition that travelled to Brazil with the daughter of Emperor Francis I of Habsburg, Leopoldina, who married the crown prince of Brazil, Dom Pedro, the future King Pedro IV of Portugal. During his stay in Brazil, Thomas made hundreds of drawings and watercolours that are to be found in the collection of the Akademie der Künste in Vienna today. In 1832, he married Therese Árvay, daughter of an official of Buda castle. From 1837 we find Thomas in Vienna again as ordinary professor of landscape painting but he often left the city for Italy and the course of the Danube."
1588,"ENGEL, Carl Ludwig","(b. 1778, Berlin, d. 1840, Helsinki)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/engel/biograph.html,"
German architect, active in Finland. He studied in Berlin under Schinkel, and arrived in Finland from Estonia where he was a town architect of Tallinn."
1589,"ENGEL, Josef Franz","(b. ca. 1776, Wien, d. 1827, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/engel_j/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect. Together with Joseph Hardtmuth and Joseph Kornhäusel, he was the court architect to the princes of Liechtenstein. They created an architecture of follies, pavilions, miniature palaces and all the other accoutrements of an English garden in Feldsberg (Valtice) and Eisgrub (Lednice) in Moravia."
1590,"ENGELBRECHTSZ., Cornelis","(b. ca. 1462, Leiden, d. 1527, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/engelbre/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, the leading artist of his day. He is thought to have trained in Brussels and seems to have returned home through Antwerp. Although his style shows the influence of the Italianate tendencies prevalent of Antwerp, Engebrechtsz.'s work has a deeper intensity of feeling that is Gothic rather than Mannerist in spirit. Contorted linear rhythms and resonant colouring characterize his highly personal art, which is closer to the Master of the Virgo inter Virginis than to any Antwerp artist. The altarpieces of the Crucifixion and The Lamentation in the Municipal Museum, Leiden, are typical of his works. Lucas van Leyden was his greatest pupil and tends to overshadow his achievements. The other pupils in his large studio included his three sons, Pieter, Cornelis, and Lucas, as well as Lucas van Leyden's brother, Aertgen.



"
1591,"ENGERT, Erasmus","(b. 1796, Wien, d. 1871, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/engert/biograph.html,"
Austrian Biedermeier painter and restorer. Born in Vienna, he studied at the local academy, then went to Italy. After his return he painted portraits and historical paintings, including copies of older masterpieces. In 1843, he was curator of the Art Gallery of the Belvedere in which position he was dedicated to restoration. In 1857 he became director of the gallery and published a catalogue. His administrative skills allowed too little time for his art."
1592,"ENSINGEN, Ulrich von","(b. ca. 1365, Swabia, d. 1419, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/ensingen/biograph.html,"
German architect and sculptor. He belonged to a family of architects who came from Ensingen near Ulm, Wurtemberg, and who shared as master-builders in the construction of the most important Gothic buildings of the fifteenth century in Southern Germany. Ulrich, the founder of the family, is known from the year 1391. Apparently he learned his craft in the stonemason's guild of Ulm, and was also a pupil of Master Heinrich the Younger of Ulm. In 1391 he was asked to take charge of the work on the Milan cathedral, but he seems to have stayed in Ulm, where he was architect of the cathedral until his death. At first his engagement at Ulm was for five years only, but in 1397 he was appointed master architect for life."
1593,"ENSOR, James","(b. 1860, Oostende, d. 1949, Oostende)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/ensor/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter, printmaker and draughtsman. Trained in Brussels, he spent most of his life in his native Ostend. In 1883 he joined a group known as Les Vingt (The Twenty) and began depicting skeletons, phantoms, masks, and other images of grotesque fantasy as social commentary. His Entry of Christ into Brussels (1888), painted in smeared, garish colours, provoked outrage."
1594,"ENZOLA, Gianfrancesco di Luca",(active 1455-1478 in Parma),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/enzola/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith and medalist. Gianfrancesco di Luca Enzola is recorded as working as a goldsmith, medalist and die engraver between 1455 and 1478. Nothing is known of his pupilage or the sources of his style, but he was an artist of some originality on two counts. He was the first medalist to produce struck portrait medals in the Renaissance, and he was sufficient enough as a sculptor to have anticipated the extraordinary portrait effigies of Niccolò Fiorentino's school of the late fifteenth century. The earliest medals by Enzola date between 1455 and 1471 and portray Francesco I Sforza of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and the rulers of Berceto, Forli, and Faenza. These medals were originally struck, although struck specimens are exceedingly rare."
1595,"EPINAY, Prosper d'","(b. 1836, Pamplemousses, Mauritius, d. 1914, Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/epinay/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was born a British subject and was the son of a prominent advocate in Mauritius. From 1857 to 1860 he studied caricature with the sculptor Jean-Pierre Dantan in Paris, and in 1861 he worked in the Rome studio of Luigi Amici (1813-1897). He was active in Rome and London between 1864 and 1874 but from the mid-1870s increasingly turned his attention from London to Paris."
1596,"ERDMANNSDORFF, Friedrich Wilhelm von","(b. 1736, Dresden, d. 1800, Dessau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erdmanns/biograph.html,"
German architect. He travelled with his friend and patron, the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau in the British Isles (1763-64, where he imbibed Palladianism and aspects of the Picturesque, especially from English landscaped gardens), and Italy (1761-66, and 1770-71, where he absorbed Neoclassicism, notably from Winckelmann and Clérisseau)."
1597,"ERHARD, Johann Christoph","(b. 1795, Nürnberg, d. 1822, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erhard/biograph.html,"
German painter, etcher, and draftsman. He began his apprenticeship with the Nuremberg copper engraver Ambrosius Gabler (1762-1834). There he learned the etching and developed a special passion for the landscape. In this time, Erhard closely followed the artists Johann Adam Klein (1792-1875) and Georg Christoph Wilder (1797-1855). He undertook excursions with them to the surrounding areas, to study nature. The Russian troops, who were frequently drawn through Nuremberg from 1812 to 1814, gave him the opportunity to draw horses and military groups."
1598,"ERHART, Gregor","(b. 1460/79, Ulm, d. 1540, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erhart/gregor/biograph.html,"
German sculptor in wood and stone, trained in late Gothic style but subsequently influenced by the Renaissance. He was the son of Michael Erhart (active 1469-1522 in Ulm) and he is recorded for the first time in 1494 in Augsburg. However, it is probable that before 1497 he worked in his father's workshop at Ulm and received his training there. His participation in the execution of the Blaubeuren Altarpiece is presumed. In Augsburg he held the foremost place at the beginning of the 16th century."
1599,"ERHART, Michael",(active 1469-1522 in Ulm),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erhart/michael/biograph.html,"
Michael Erhart, German sculptor, is attested as a sculptor in Ulm between 1469 and 1522. His son Gregor (1460/79-1540), also a sculptor, is recorded for the first time in 1494 in Augsburg. He was the most significant sculptor, after Hans Multscher, active in Ulm in the last third of the 15th century. His masterpiece is the Blaubeuren Altarpiece, executed in 1494-94 with the contribution of his son, which marks the culmination of the mature Ulm style of Michael Erhart, beyond which his later sculptural works show no further advance.



"
1600,"ERIKSEN, Vigilius","(b. 1722, København, d. 1783, Rungstedgard)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eriksen/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, active also in Russia. He was apprenticed to the portrait painter Johann Salomon Wahl in Copenhagen. In 1755 he competed unsuccessfully for the gold medal at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen with a historical painting, Lot and his Wife (untraced). In a letter he complained that the rules did not allow him to enter a portrait, a genre more suited to his talents. Presumably in 1756 he completed the portraits of the registrar of the royal art collections, Lorenz Spengler and his Wife (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen). These portraits already show the specific features of Eriksen's style, characterized by precise rendering of the sitter, distinct modelling of form and a cool virtuosity in the unemphatic treatment of dresses and accessories."
1601,"ERRI, Agnolo degli",(active 1442-1497 in Modena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erri/agnolo/biograph.html,"
The Modenese painter Agnolo degli Erri (sometimes referred to as Angelo), Italian painter documented from 1442 to 1497, worked largely in the territory of the Este. Often collaborating with his younger brother, Bartolomeo, and Bartolomeo's son, Pellegrino, Agnolo decorated Estense residences in Modena, Sassuolo, and San Martino in Rio. In 1449 he made miniatures for the Oratorio dell'Ospedale in Modena; he also carried out minor and decorative works for the municipal government there."
1602,"ERRI, Bartolomeo degli",(active 1460-1479 in Modena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/erri/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Bartolomeo degli Erri, and his brothers Bartolomeo Bonascia and Agnolo are considered key figures of the Quattrocento period in Modena.  It has proved impossible to distinguish the hand of each in individual works, most of which were commissioned from them and probably executed in collaboration."
1603,"ES, Jacob van","(b. ca. 1596, Antwerpen, d. 1666, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/es/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Together with Osias Beert and Clara Peeters, he was one of the leading representatives of the archaizing trend in Flemish still-lifes. His birthplace is known from the text on an engraving by Wenceslaus Hollar after a painting by Jan Meyssens (1612-70). Van Es became a master in Antwerp in 1617 but did not join the Guild of St Luke until 1645. Jacob Gillis and Jan van Thiene were his pupils in 1621 and 1623 respectively. He enjoyed a certain esteem among fellow artists, for Jacob Jordaens, Cornelis Schut the Elder and Deodaat del Monte were godfathers to his children. Numerous mentions of works by van Es in inventories of 17th-century Antwerp collectors further testify to his success; the inventory of Rubens's collection, for instance, includes two still-lifes by van Es.



"
1604,"ESCALANTE, Juan Antonio Frias y","(b. 1633, Cordoba, d. 1670, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/escalant/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was an outstanding figure in decorative Baroque art. When quite young he moved from Andalusia to Madrid, where he apparently worked with and was influenced by Francisco Rizi. His artistic development reveals an increasing admiration for Veronese, Tintoretto and Titian, although elements of the style of Alonso Cano persist. Among his first works is Andromeda and the Dragon (c. 1659; Madrid, Prado), whose mannerist elements derive from an engraving of the subject by Agostino Carracci. The two brilliant works St Catherine of Alexandria (Madrid, Las Maravillas) and Road to Calvary (Museo de la Real Academia de San Fernando, Madrid), signed and dated 1660, are executed with an agile and self-assured technique, in colours that stem from Venetian painting."
1605,"ESCHWEGE, Wilhelm Ludwig von","(b. 1777, Aue, Saxony, d. 1855, Wolfsanger)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eschwege/biograph.html,"
Baron von Wilhelm Ludwig Eschwege was a German engineer, mineralogist and architect."
1606,"ESPINOSA, Juan de",(documented 1628-1659 in Madrid),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/espinosa/biograph.html,"
Spanish still-life painter. Following the lead of Juan Fernandez El Labrador, Juan de Espinosa, who belonged to the same generation as Antonio Ponce, earned a reputation as a specialist in still-life paintings with grapes. An inventive master, he surprised his admirers with a wide variety of types of picture.



"
1607,"ESPINOSA, Juan Bautista de","(b. ca. 1590, ?, d. ca. 1641, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/espinosb/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Details of his life are scarce. He is documented in Madrid and Toledo between 1628 and 1659. He was probably an orphan of humble origins, being brought up by Eugenia de Lievana, sister of the Madrid silversmith Onofre de Espinosa. He married in 1628, the same year as Antonio Ponce, who was probably of a similar age, and like Ponce appears to have specialised in still-lifes in response to the demand for such works following the death of Juan van der Hamen in 1631."
1608,"ESQUIVEL Y SUÁREZ DE URBINA, Antonio Maria","(b. 1806, Sevilla, d. 1857, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/esquivel/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He began the studies of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Seville, where he was educated in the style of Murillo. In 1831, he moved to Madrid, where he received academic merit in the competition at the Academy of San Fernando. In 1837 he actively participated in the founding of the Artistic and Literary Lyceum in Madrid. In 1839, in Seville he became ill that left him almost blind. He was supported by his colleagues and friends, and, fortunately, he regained vision in 1840."
1609,"ESSELENS, Jacob","(b. ca. 1627, Amsterdam, d. 1687, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/esselens/biograph.html,"
Dutch draughtsman and painter. He was referred to as a 'painter' on the occasion of his (late) marriage on 11 April 1668, but in the will drawn up after the death of his wife in 1677 he is called a 'merchant'. He did indeed trade in silks and velvets. As an artist, he was self-taught and should probably be considered an amateur. His textile business occasioned visits, among other places, to Italy, France, England and Scotland, where he made accomplished landscape drawings. Panoramic views of English towns (Chatham, Greenwich, London, Rochester and Rye) dating from the 1660s were later included in the Atlas van der Hem (Vienna, Österreich)."
1610,"ESTEVE Y MARQUES, Agustín","(b. 1753, Valencia, d. ca. 1820, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/esteve/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He may have been the son of a Valencian sculptor of the same name, Agustín Esteve, documented between 1764 and 1767. He attended the school of the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos, Valencia, and in 1772 went to Madrid to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he won a prize, although he was not to have an important academic career. He established himself in Madrid, where the ducal houses of Osuna and Alba were the first to give him commissions. One of these was for the portrait of Dona Joaquina Tellez-Giron (1784; Madrid, Museo del Prado), daughter of the 9th Duque de Osuna, painted when she was 13. For more than 25 years Esteve y Marques painted portraits, mainly for aristocratic circles, among whom his simple, flattering and uncritical style was well accepted.



"
1611,"ETEX, Antoine","(b. 1808, Paris, d. 1888, Chaville)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/etex/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, painter, etcher, architect and writer. The son of a decorative sculptor, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1824 as a pupil of Charles Dupaty (1771-1825), moving in 1825 to the studio of James Pradier. Ingres also took an interest in his education, and Etex's gratitude towards him and Pradier was later expressed in projects for monuments to them (that to Pradier not executed, that in bronze to Ingres erected Montauban, Promenade des Carmes, 1868-71). He is best known as a sculptor. Among his works are two large groups, Resistance and Peace, on the Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, Paris; Géricault's tomb; and the monument to Ingres at Montauban.



"
1612,"ETTY, William","(b. 1787, York, d. 1849, York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/etty/biograph.html,"
English painter. Born into a Methodist family, he was the seventh child of a miller and baker in Feasegate, York, and in 1798 he was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck, publisher of the Hull Packet. Financial support from his uncle, a banker, allowed him to go to London in 1805, where he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1806. For a year, in 1807-8, he was a pupil of Thomas Lawrence, who greatly influenced him. Following the death of his uncle in 1809 he became financially secure. From 1811 he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and the British Institution and in 1816 worked in the studio of Jean-Baptiste Regnault in Paris."
1613,"EVENEPOEL, Henri","(b. 1872, Nice. d. 1899, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/evenepoe/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter and printmaker. His mother died when he was two, and he was brought up by his severe but cultivated father, a senior civil servant and musicologist. He studied in Brussels under the architect Ernest Acker (1852-1912) at the Académie des Beaux-Arts (1889-90), the painter Ernest Blanc-Garin (1843-1916) and the decorative painter Adolphe Crespin (1859-1944), then entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris on 21 October 1892 as a pupil of Pierre Victor. Galland. Galland died in November 1892, and Evenepoel was admitted to Gustave Moreau's atelier on 14 March 1893. There he came into contact with Georges Rouault and became friendly with Henri Matisse. For more than four years Evenepoel was very close to Moreau, a demanding teacher who appreciated his sensitivity and determination and encouraged him to develop a distinct artistic personality."
1614,"EVERDINGEN, Allaert van","(b. 1621, Alkmaar, d. 1675, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/everding/allaert/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape and marine painter. He worked with Savery in Utrecht and Molyn in Haarlem. In the 1640s he visited Scandinavia, where he developed a taste for subjects inspired by the scenery there - above all mountain torrents - and helped to popularize such themes in the Netherlands. Jacob van Ruisdael, in his pictures of majestic waterfalls, was one of the artists influenced by him. Allaert was also a fine etcher."
1615,"EVERDINGEN, Caesar van","(b. 1617, Alkmaar, d. 1678, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/everding/caesar/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the elder brother of Allaert van Everdingen. He painted portraits and historical pictures, and was attracted by the south not the north. Although he never went to Italy, he captured the spirit of Italian art better than many of his countrymen who crossed the Alps: witness his beautiful Four Muses with Pegasus (c.1650), part of the decoration of the royal villa - the Huis ten Bosch - at The Hague. Van Everdingen's work represent a high point in Dutch Classicism."
1616,"EVERSDIJCK, Willem","(b. ca. 1616, Goes, d. 1671, Middelburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eversdij/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of the painter Cornelis Eversdijck (c. 1580-c. 1644) and Francyntje Zagarus. He was first the pupil of his father, then in 1653 he is documented in Antwerp as the pupil of Cornelis de Vos. In 1653 he joined the Guild of St Luke in Middelburg, the city where he spent his entire career. He was a portraitist, several signed portraits of the members of his family are known from the 1660s. A group portrait in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam entitled Allegory of the Flowering of the Dutch Fishery is also attributed to him.



"
1617,"EWORTH, Hans",(active 1540-1574 in England),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eworth/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England. 'Jan Euworts' was listed in 1540 as a freeman of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp, but by 1545 he had moved to England, where until 1571 his name, spelt in a wide variety of ways (e.g. Eeworts, Eottes, Euertz, Evance, Eworts, Ewotes, Ewout, Ewoutsz., Eywooddes, Hawarde, Heward, Huett etc), appeared in numerous naturalization, tax and parish documents. About 35 paintings are generally attributed to him, consisting primarily of dated portraits of the English gentry and nobility. The majority are signed with the monogram HE, which led to their being attributed to the Flemish painter Lucas de Heere during the 18th and 19th centuries.

1618,"EXNER, Johan Julius","(b. 1825, København, d. 1910, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/exner/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He was an extremely successful and popular genre painter who began his training in 1839 at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. Later in his career, he studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, commonly referred to as the Father of Danish Painting."
1619,"EYCK, Hubert van",(died 1426),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eyck_van/hubert/biograph.html,"
In the past, art historians, for various reasons, have sometimes cast doubt on the existence of Hubert Van Eyck. Today, however, no one still seriously claims that the elder brother of Jan, Lambert and Margareta Van Eyck never existed. He was born at Maeseyck, near Mons, though the date of his birth is unknown. The name Hubert itself, which was not common in Ghent, may well indicate his foreign origin. A few facts can be gleaned from his tombstone, which is now in the Lapidary Museum in St Bavo's Abbey. An inscription engraved on a copper plate which has since disappeared but which was once affixed to the stone, recorded 18 September 1426 as the date of his death. However, the most crucial piece of information to have come down to us is the quatrain inscribed on the frame of the Adoration of the Lamb, the Van Eyck brothers' most celebrated work. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432. It states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vyd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The quatrain was discovered in 1823. Although its authenticity was once contested it is now generally recognized as genuine.

1620,"EYCK, Jan van","(b. before 1395, Maaseik, d. 1441, Bruges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eyck_van/jan/biograph.html,"

Jan van Eyck, the most famous and innovative Flemish painter of the 15th century, is thought to have come from the village of Maaseyck in Limbourg.

"
1621,"EYCK, Barthélemy d'",(active 1444–1469 in France),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eyckbart/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in France. The son of Ydria Exters 'd'Allemagne' (d 1460) and the stepson of Pierre du Billant, he is first recorded on 19 February 1444 as a witness with Enguerrand Charonton in Aix-en-Provence and described as 'magister Bartolomeus de Ayck pictor', inhabitant of Aix. From c. 1447 he was 'peintre et varlet de chambre' at the court of René I, King of Naples (reg 1438-42) and Duke of Anjou (reg 1434-80). Between 1447 and 1449 Barthélemy worked at René's château of Tarascon (Bouches-du-Rhône) in a room close to the Duke's own apartments. There his activities may have included supervising fellow artists, providing designs and perhaps painting the ceiling decoration of the Royal Apartments in the east wing of the château (de Mérindol). In 1451 Barthélemy travelled in the Duke's entourage to Guyenne, and in 1456 he was at Angers, which he visited on a number of other occasions."
1622,"EYCK, Gaspard van","(b. 1613, Antwerpen, d. 1673, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eyckgasp/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, specialized in seascapes and naval combats. In 1625, his name appears in the register of the St Luke Guild in Antwerp as the pupil of Andries van Eertvelt, an in 1632-33 as master. He went to Italy where he worked in Genoa. From Italy he went to Spain. In 1656, he suffered a mental crisis and he was placed under the tutelage of his brother, Hendrik van Eyck. Later he moved to Brussels where he lived until his death."
1623,"EYNDE, Jan van den",(active 1660-1700),https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eynde/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect, possibly related to the Antwerp family of sculptors of the same name. His major work was the new abbey church at Averbode, for which he was awarded the commission in 1644 after Lucas Faydherbe's plans had been rejected. The ground-plan of this Baroque church combines a centralized cruciform space to the west for the laity with a deep choir, necessary for Norbertine choral services. Van den Eynde probably based this combination of central and axial plans, resulting in an imposing and spacious interior, on other Flemish Baroque churches.

1624,"EYSERBECK, Johann August","(b. 1762, Vogelheerd, Luisium, d. 1801, Berlin-Charlottenburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/eyserbec/biograph.html,"
German garden architect, Prussian court gardener. He was the son of Johann Friedrich Eyserbeck, who directed the garden design in Wörlitz. Friedrich Wilhelm II summoned him from Dessau to modernize the royal gardens of Prussia in a scenic manner.



"
1625,"EZQUERRA, Jerónimo Antonio","(b. ca. 1660, Madrid, d. 1733, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/e/ezquerra/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Although very little known about his life, he must have been a prominent member of the Madrid painting scene of the early 18th century. He was the son of an unknown Lucas de Ezquerra from the town of Pomar (Burgos), who was unrelated to the world of painting, and not of the painter Domingo de Ezquerra as has sometimes been assumed. His life and painting indicate a clear link with Juan Carreño de Miranda. In her will of 1686, Carreño's widow bequeathed him a sword and dagger that had belonged to her husband - an obvious testament to their close personal relationship - while their artistic link can be seen in his Immaculate Conception, signed in 1710, in the convent of Clarissan nuns in Olite (Navarre), which is faithfully based on the models created by Carreño."
1626,"FABBRINI, Giuseppe Antonio","(b. ca. 1740, Firenze, d. ca. 1795, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabbrini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. There are known frescoes by him in on the vault of the nave of he church in the monastery of Vallombrosa. In 1780 he painted an Assumption of the Virgin on the polygonal cupola in the same church."
1627,"FABER VON CREUZNACH, Conrad","(b. ca. 1500, Kreuznach, d. ca. 1553, Frankfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/faber/biograph.html,"

1628,"FABISCH, Joseph-Hugues","(b. 1812, Aix-en-Provence, d. 1886, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabisch/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. In 1840, he settles in Saint-Étienne where he is professor of drawing at the university of the city. He leaves the city for Lyon in 1845 where he becomes professor of the École des Beaux-Arts."
1629,"FABRE, François-Xavier","(b. 1766, Montpellier, d. 1837, Montpellier)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabre/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker and collector. He was taught by the painter Jean Coustou (1719-91) in Montpellier before entering, in 1783, the studio of David, to whose artistic principles he remained faithful all his life. His career as a history painter began brilliantly when, in 1787, he won the Prix de Rome for Nebuchadnezzar Ordering the Execution of Zedekiah's Children (Paris, Ecole Normale Supérieur des Beaux-Arts). This early success was consolidated by the four years he spent at the Académie de France in Rome and by the enthusiastic reception of his Death of Abel (1790; Montpellier, Musée Fabre) at the Salon of 1791."
1630,"FABRIS, Michele","(b. ca. 1644, Pozsony, d. 1684, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabri/biograph.html,"
Hungarian sculptor, active in Italy, born in Pozsony, that time the capital of Hungary, presently Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Known as Ongaro (the Hungarian) came to Venice around 1662. Details of his artistic training in his formative years are not known."
1631,"FABRIS, Pietro",(active 1756-1779 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabris/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver. He worked in Naples for most of his life, but frequently added the phrase 'English painter' to his signature. He is noted for landscapes and genre scenes that illustrate events at the royal court and picturesque scenes of Neapolitan life, including pedlars, fishermen, picnickers and dancers. His works were popular with the British, Americans, and Europeans making the Grand Tour."
1632,"FABRITIUS, Barent","(b. 1624, Midden-Beemster, d. 1673, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabritiu/barent/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman, brother of Carel Fabritius. Like Carel, he was first taught painting by his father, also learnt carpentry and practised as an artisan in Midden-Beemster in 1641. He is documented in Amsterdam in 1643 and 1647, though it is not known if, like his brother, he was also a pupil of Rembrandt. Nevertheless, his style is similar to that of the Rembrandt school. He must have been trained in the second half of the 1640s. His work is reminiscent of the style of his brother, who clearly influenced and may also have instructed him."
1633,"FABRITIUS, Carel","(b. 1622, Middenbeemster, d. 1654, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fabritiu/carel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists. Pieter Carelsz. (1598–1653) was a teacher and talented amateur painter, who apparently used the nickname 'Fabritius' (from Lat. faber: 'craftsman'). His son Carel Fabritius, despite his early death, had a great influence on late 17th-century Dutch painting. Pieter's second son Barent Fabritius was a lesser artist, much influenced by Rembrandt and by his own brother. A third son, Johannes Fabritius (1636–after 1693), was a still-life painter."
1634,"FACCHETTI, Pietro","(b. ca. 1537, Mantova, d. 1619, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/facchett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born to a poor family in Mantua. He trained with Lorenzo Costa the Younger, then moved to Rome and joined the studio of Scipione da Gaeta (1544-1598), where he gained fame as a portrait painter."
1635,"FACCINI, Pietro","(b. ca. 1562, Bologna, d. 1602, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/faccini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He began to paint around the age of 30 and produced only about a dozen paintings, datable between 1590 and 1602. Malvasia mentioned his training in the Carracci Academy in Bologna, which ended c. 1594 when Faccini, envious of Annibale Carracci's rapid success, opened his own school."
1636,"FAGAN, Robert","(b. 1761, London, d. 1816, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fagan/biograph.html,"
Irish painter, archaeologist, and art dealer. Although art historians consistently include Fagan within the ranks of Irish portrait artists, there is no written record of his connection with Ireland, although his father, a Covent Garden baker, was believed to have been born in Cork and Fagan himself claimed to be Irish."
1637,"FALCIATORE, Filippo",(documented 1718-1768 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falciato/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Naples. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Vaccaro, and then of his son, Domenico Antonio Vaccaro (1678-1745), an artist whose influence was to pervade all his early work, inspiring small pictures bathed in clear, silvery light and azure tonalities that gradually shaped his 'neo-Mannerist' Rococo style. His early works are mostly scenes from the Old and New Testament, now dispersed among public and private collections both in Italy and abroad. In these works, while following the footsteps of the master, he updated the schemes with a new sensitivity."
1638,"FALCONETTO, Giovanni Maria","(b. 1468, Verona, d. 1535, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falcon/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect. He was one of the foremost painters working in the Renaissance style in Verona in the early 16th century and is notable for his employment of antique themes. His later architectural works are an important feature of the city of Padua. His work prepared the architectural climate for the large-scale shift of interest to antiquity, which reached a climax in the next generation of architects in northern Italy, especially in the work of Andrea Palladio.


"
1639,"FALCONE, Bernardo",(active 1659-1694),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falconbe/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He probably came from Lugano. By tracing his sculptures, it is possible to gain intermittent knowledge of his whereabouts. In 1659 he was in Venice, where he carved a Virgin, a St Dominic and a St Thomas for the high altar of SS Giovanni e Paolo. From 1664 to 1671 he was in Turin. He contributed to the sculptural decoration of the Palazzo Reale's park with a marble Hercules (1699-71; Museo Civico d'Arte Antica, Turin), which originally formed part of a group (untraced), executed in collaboration with Bernardo Paleari and Bernardino Quadri. The figure, 3.3 m high, is related stylistically to Falcone's contemporaneous St Sebastian (c. 1660; Scalzi, Venice). An exaggerated musculature, typical of late Mannerist style, characterizes both."
1640,"FALCONE, Aniello","(b. 1607, Napoli, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falcone/biograph.html,"
Neapolitan painter. He was one of the most prominent artists in Naples in the generation before the plague of 1656 (in which he died), and did religious paintings, some in fresco, for several churches in the city. His only complete surviving fresco cycle, however, is the History of Moses in the Villa Roomer at Barra, and he is now remembered mainly as the first specialist in battle pieces, a genre that won him an international reputation and in which he inspired his pupil Salvator Rosa. Falcone was also an outstanding draughtsman.



"
1641,"FALCONET, Étienne-Maurice","(b. 1716, Paris, d. 1791, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falconet/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and writer on art, a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. Falconet was perhaps the most quintessentially Rococo of all French sculptors, his forté being gently erotic figures such as the celebrated Bather (1757) in the Louvre. Like many other of his works, this was reproduced in porcelain by the Sèvres factory, of which he was director from 1757 to 1766, a position that he gained through the influence of his patron Mme de Pompadour."
1642,"FALDA, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1643, Valduggia, d. 1678, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falda/biograph.html,"
Italian draughtsman and printmaker, active in Rome. He was apprenticed to the painter Francesco Ferrari as a child and was mentored by Gian Lorenzo Bernini when he moved to Rome at the age of fourteen. His early work was noticed by the printmaker and publisher Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi, who took Falda on as an apprentice at his print shop. Members of the de Rossi family were the principal publishers of prints in Rome during the seventeenth century, and almost all of Falda's work was published at this shop. There, Falda learned all the technical skills of engraving and etching, while also honing his realistic, illustrative style of drawing. De Rossi also put Falda in contact with emerging figures of the Roman art world, such as Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Falda finished his training at the age of 20, subsequently beginning his career as a printmaker."
1643,"FALGUIÈRE, Jean Alexandre Joseph","(b. 1831, Toulouse, d. 1900, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/falguier/biograph.html,"
Jean Alexandre Joseph Falguière (in short Alexandre Falguière), French sculptor and painter. He was a student of François Jouffroy in Paris, then spent the period 1860 to 1867 in Rome. He was regarded as the successor to Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, and the first Realist of nineteenth-century French sculpture. His restrained classical, and in most cases female mythological figures - the Dianas, nymphs, and bacchantes - made him extremely popular."
1644,"FANCELLI, Cosimo","(b. ca. 1620, Roma, d. 1688, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fancelli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was one of four sons of Carlo Fancelli (c. 1566-1640), a stonecutter from Arezzo. He and his older brother, Giacomo Antonio Fancelli (1619-71), also a sculptor, were trained by Bernini and often worked together on the same projects. Cosimo may have helped his brother to carve reliefs for the decoration of pilasters in the nave of St Peter's, Rome (1647), and the colossal statue of the Nile for the Fountain of the Four Rivers (1648-50; Rome, Piazza Navona); both projects were designed and supervised by Bernini. Cosimo also worked closely with Pietro da Cortona from 1648 until the latter's death in 1669, and between 1667 and 1669 with Bernini, Carlo Rainaldi and Johann Paul Schor. He was one of the most prolific Roman sculptors of his generation, and he specialized in providing stucco sculpture for large projects designed by architects and decorators. His style was derived from that of the artists with whom he collaborated.



"
1645,"FANCELLI, Luca","(b. ca. 1430, Settignano, d. after 1494)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fancellj/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He trained as a stonecutter but was involved more with architecture than sculpture. Several contradictory references by Vasari relate to Fancelli's early career and attribute to him the construction of the Palazzo Pitti, the tribune of SS Annunziata and other Florentine buildings designed by Brunelleschi and Alberti. Vasari's proposal, however, lacks documentary confirmation, since Fancelli moved c. 1450 to Mantua, where he entered the service of Ludovico II Gonzaga, 2nd Marquis of Mantua. While there he supervised the construction of Alberti's churches of S Sebastiano (from 1460) and S Andrea (from 1472); his personal contribution to these buildings, especially S Andrea, which was begun only shortly before Alberti's death, should not be underestimated.


"
1646,"FANTACCHIOTTI, Odoardo","(b. 1811, Roma, d. 1877, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fantacch/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, renowned for his refined marbles which revived Renaissance-inspired subjects in the Neoclassical period. These skills are highlighted in a low-relief carving of the Virgin and Child in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. So impressive was his technique that it was initially thought the relief may have been by Donatello when the museum purchased it from a private collection. It was suggested at the turn of the century that it postdated the Renaissance, and Sir John Pope-Hennessy later attributed it to Fantacchiotti's hand."
1647,"FANTI, Sigismondo",(active 1510-1530 in Ferrara),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fanti/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, astrologer, mathematician, and writing-master from Ferrara. In 1514 he published Theorica et Practica de modo scribendi fabricandique omnes litterarum species (Venice: Giovanni Rosso, 1514). This was the first illustrated manual on the art of writing, and the first book illustrated with calligraphic models of the alphabet. It provided practical advice on selecting implements, making ink, on the correct way of holding the pen, and on spacing letters."
1648,"FANTIN-LATOUR, Henri","(b. 1836, Grenoble, d. 1904, Orne)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fantin/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He studied with his father, Jean-Théodore Fantin-Latour (1805-1875), from 1846 and then with Horace Lecocq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897) at the Petite École de Dessin in Paris from 1850 to 1856. His apprenticeship was based on copying the Old Masters before beginning to study from nature. He had a growing enthusiasm for the Italian painters, particularly Titian and Veronese, whom he copied in the Louvre from 1852. The Dream (1854; Grenoble, Musée Grenoble) is one of the first of a series of imaginary scenes in which Fantin-Latour concentrated on the theme of vision, which he later continued in his representations of scenes from various operas. He met François Bonvin and Félix Bracquemond in 1853 and went to the École des Beaux-Arts in 1854, but he left before the end of the year. He began to paint the life around him and did a series of self-portraits from 1854 to 1861, such as Self-portrait Seated at the Easel (1858; Berlin, Alte Nationalgalerie) and Self-portrait (1859; Grenoble, Musée Grenoble). "
1649,"FANTONI, Andrea","(b. 1659, Rovetta, d. 1734, Rovetta)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fantoni/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and woodcarver, active in the region near Bergamo. He trained with his family of artisans as well as the noted woodcarver Pietro Ramus (1639-1682), and then traveled to Parma to work in the Palazzo Ducale. He returned to Rovetta in 1679."
1650,"FANTUZZI, Antonio",(active 1537-1550 in Fontainebleau),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fantuzzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. All that is known about his early life is that he was born in Bologna, from the accounts at Fontainebleau and one inscription on a print (see illustration)."
1651,"FANZAGO, Cosimo","(b. 1591, Bergamo, d. 1678, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fanzago/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, sculptor and interior designer, the leading sculptor in Naples in his days. His prowess in many fields of art and his remarkable facility of production led him to a position of unchallenged supremacy in 17th-century Neapolitan architecture, where his styles exhibit every nuance, from the severe classicism of Early Baroque via an exuberant use of coloured marbles and the occasional exploitation of Mannerist detail, to a scenographic Late Baroque. His culture was that of the Counter Reformation and his taste was all for decoration; from his school arose the plastic style of southern Italy, with fountains and pulpits, railings and altars, and polychrome inlays."
1652,"FARELLI, Giacomo","(b. 1629, Roma, d. 1706, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/farelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born in Rome but in 1644 moved with his family to Naples where he studied with Andrea Vaccaro. When very young, he gave an early proof of his talent, in a painting of St Bridget, for the church dedicated to her in Naples. Subsequently he altered his manner in an attempt to rival Domenichino."
1653,"FARGUE, Jacob Elias La","(b. 1735, Voorburg, d. after 1771, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fargue/jacob/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of the La Fargue family of artists. He was the younger brother of Paulus Constantijn La Fargue. The oeuvre of Jacob Elias, who regularly collaborated with Paulus, consists mostly of paintings and drawings of The Hague and surroundings, but he also depicted Haarlem, Amsterdam, Utrecht and Amersfoort. He was strongly influenced by Paulus, although Jacob was a freer draughtsman, and his palette was darker in tone."
1654,"FARGUE, Paulus Constantijn La","(b. 1729, Den Haag, d. 1782, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fargue/paulus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman and printmaker, part of the La Fargue family of artists. Like many 18th-century Dutch topographical artists he began his career by painting wall decorations. In the late 1750s he worked in collaboration with his younger brother Jacob Elias for patrons such as the French Ambassador to The Hague, Louis-Auguste-Augustin, Comte d'Affry, and the English envoy, Sir Joseph Yorke. In 1761 he joined Pictura, at the same time as Jacob Elias."
1655,"FARINATI, Paolo","(b. 1524, Verona, d. 1606, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/farinati/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was the son of a painter, Giambattista, but probably trained in the workshop of Nicola Giolfino. His earliest documented painting, St Martin and the Beggar (1552; Mantua Cathedral), was commissioned by Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga along with works by Battista dell'Angolo del Moro, Veronese and Domenico Brusasorci for Mantua Cathedral, newly restored by Giulio Romano. As is evident in his chiaroscuro and figure types, Farinati had absorbed certain Mannerist influences from the frescoes of scenes from the Life of the Virgin (1534) in the choir of Verona Cathedral, executed by Francesco Torbido to Giulio's design. Giolfino's eccentric style would also have encouraged Farinati to emphasize line over colour and to restrict his palette to rather opaque greys, browns, mauve and rust. His two-canvas Massacre of the Innocents (1556; Verona, Santa Maria in Organo) displays the muscular figures, sharp foreshortenings and posed attitudes of Mannerism and has a more polished finish than his earlier work. Its strong, plastic qualities are also evident in Christ Walking on the Water and the Supper of St Gregory (1558) in the choir of the same church. These characteristics are united with a more defined architectural space, derived from Veronese, in his Ecce homo (1562; Verona, Castelvecchio)."
1656,"FASOLO, Bernardino","(b. ca. 1489, Pavia, d. after 1526, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fasolo/biograph.html,"
Bernardino Fasolo (also known as Fazoli or Fazola da Pavia), Italian painter. He was the son and pupil of Lorenzo Fasolo (1463-c. 1518) who belonged to the Foppa school and moved to Genoa in 1495/96. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries a number of Lombard artists moved to Genoa. One such artist was Bernardino Fasola,"
1657,"FASOLO, Giovanni Antonio","(b. 1530, Mandello del Lario, d. 1572, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fasolo_g/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Of Lombard origin, he was initially a pupil of Paolo Veronese and subsequently had a short but successful career as a fresco and portrait painter in and around Vicenza. In 1551-52 he collaborated with Gian Battista Zelotti and Veronese on frescoes for the Castello Porto-Colleoni, Thiene. Scenes such as the Meeting of Sophonisba and Massinissa are executed in the style of Veronese, but with a noticeably harder and drier edge and lacking Veronese's rich luminosity and effortless control of space."
1658,"FATTORI, Giovanni","(b. 1825, Livorno, d. 1908, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fattori/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher. Initially established as a painter of military subjects, he came to be one of the leading Italian plein-air painters of landscape with figures. He was one of the leaders of the group known as the Macchiaioli. Towards the end of his life he produced many excellent etchings, mainly of rural subjects.



"
1659,"FAUVEAU, Félicie de","(b. 1801, Livorno, d. 1886, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fauveau/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. She moved to France at the peak of the Restoration, after having spent her childhood in Florence. In Paris, she studied painting and sculpture and cultivated an interest in archeology and ancient symbolism, establishing a studio in Paris from 1826 to 1830 which was frequented by artists such as Paul Delaroche and Ary Scheffer."
1660,"FAVRETTO, Giacomo","(b. 1849, Venezia, d. 1887, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/favretto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He studied at the Accademia in Venice from 1864 to 1875. He lost an eye through a blood infection in 1877, but he recovered his general health and stayed on at the Accademia as an assistant until 1878. Favretto's early interiors and portraits were influenced by the chiaroscuro realism of Michele Cammarano. In 1878 he became a national celebrity at the Brera exhibition with his charming and amusing genre scene The Mouse (Milan, Brera). The same year he showed The Prescription (private collection) and At the Tailor's (private collection) at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, which he visited with Guglielmo Ciardi."
1661,"FAYDHERBE, Antoon","(d. 1653, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/faydherb/antoon/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, active in Mechelen. He was the brother of Maria Faydherbe and Hendrik Faydherbe (1574–1629), and the nephew of Lucas Faydherbe. He became master in the Mechelen Guild of St Luke in 1605, and dean of the guild in 1623 and 1628."
1662,"FAYDHERBE, Luc","(b. 1617, Mechelen, d. 1697, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/faydherb/lucas/biograph.html,"
Luc Faydherbe was one of a family of sculptors and architects in the Mechelen (Malines) area of Belgium. He went to Antwerp in 1636 and worked for Rubens, who became his friend. After Rubens's death, he settled in Mechelen (1640) and was the only major Baroque Flemish sculptor who never went to Italy. His works are rather like a sculptural version of a painting by Rubens or Jordaens. From the 1660s he was active as an architect.



"
1663,"FAYDHERBE, Maria","(b. 1587, Mechelen, d. 1643, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/faydherb/maria/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. She was the sister of Antoon and Hendrik Faydherbe  (1574–1629, and the aunt of Lucas Faydherbe. (Another Maria Faydherbe was the daughter of Antoon)."
1664,"FEARNLEY, Thomas","(b. 1802, Frederikshald, d. 1842, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fearnley/biograph.html,"
Norwegian painter. He was descended from a Yorkshire merchant who had settled in Norway in 1753. In 1819 he went into business but at the same time entered the Kongelige Tegneskole in Christiania (now Oslo) and received further training at the art colleges in Copenhagen (1821-23) and Stockholm (1823-27), where Karl XIV commissioned work from him."
1665,"FEDDES, Pieter","(b. ca. 1585, Harlingen, d. ca. 1634, Harlingen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/feddes/biograph.html,"
Pieter Feddes (Pieter van Harlingen), Dutch etcher, painter and poet. Like his fellow townsman Simon Frisius, Feddes was one of the few early 17th-century Dutch printmakers to practice etching rather than engraving. He etched in soft-ground but sometimes also used the engraver's burin on his plates. The earliest dated prints of 1611-15 include the frontispiece for a drawing booklet and a number of apparently related, etched copies of drawings. These sheets were associated in a hypothetical reconstruction of the second oldest drawing book in the Netherlands. His other etchings depict allegories, biblical and mythological scenes, (royal) portraits, townscapes and Frisian costumes, from which the book illustrations stand out as a group. They were published mainly in Leeuwarden (1614, 1619), where he lived from 1615, and Fraeneker (1619, 1620 and 1622). Of his paintings, a number of portraits have survived as well as a Diana and her Nymphs Surprised by Satyrs (Hoorn, Westfries Museum).



"
1666,"FEDERIGHI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1420, Siena, d. 1483)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/federigh/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He served as capomaestro of the cathedral workshop in Siena for three decades (1450-81). During this period he was involved in almost every major public artistic enterprise undertaken in the city, which was revitalized following the election (1458) of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, a Sienese, as Pope Pius II. First mentioned as an apprentice in the cathedral workshop, Federighi was employed by Jacopo della Quercia in 1438 just before the latter's death. This brief association with Quercia was crucial to the development of Federighi's robust, classicizing style. He designed, and presumably executed, the pavement panels of the cathedral."
1667,"FELICI, Vincenzo","(b. ca. 1657, Roma, d. 1715, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/felici/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, pupil of Domenico Guidi. His first known work is the statue prophet Elisha, placed at the main altar of the church of Santa Maria in Traspontina, executed in 1695. The altar was designed twenty years earlier by Carlo Fontana. His statue of St. Philip on the façade of the cathedral of Frascati (designed by Girolamo Fontana, nephew of Carlo, and created between 1696 and 1701) should have been executed around 1701."
1668,"FELTEN, Yuri Matveevich","(b. 1730, St. Petersburg, d. 1801, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/felten/biograph.html,"
Yuri Matveevich Felten (in German: Georg Friedrich Veldten) was a Russian architect. He was the  court architect to Catherine the Great. He was born into a family of German immigrants to Russia. His father, Matthias Velten, worked for the Russian Academy of Sciences as the steward."
1669,"FENDI, Peter","(b. 1796, Wien, d. 1842, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fendi/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, engraver and lithographer. In autumn 1810 he entered the Vienna Akademie to study drawing with Johann Martin Fischer, Hubert Maurer (1738-1818) and Johann Baptist Lampi. After the death of his father in 1814, Fendi was forced to leave the Akademie and become a clerk to earn his living, although he still received occasional lessons. However, he was soon taken up by the doctor and art collector Joseph Barth, who recommended him to Anton, Graf von Lamberg-Sprinzenstein; Fendi was thus able to copy the Classical and Etruscan vases in the latter's collection."
1670,"FÉNYES, Adolf","(b. 1867, Kecskemét, d. 1945, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fenyes/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter, who studied in Budapest, Weimar and Paris, then returned to Weimar, and finally, came back to Budapest. He first exhibited in 1895. After 1898 he spent the summers in Szolnok, from autumn until the spring he lived in Budapest. Among his early works the most famous are his one and two-figure compositions depicting poor people. During the first decades of the 20th century he turned towards more cheerful and colourful subjects; he painted genres and still-lifes. During and after the First World War Biblical themes became important in his art. Disheartened by the events of the Second World War he lived in seclusion and hardly worked at all.



"
1671,"FERENCZY, István","(b. 1792, Rimaszombat, d. 1856, Rimaszombat)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferenczy/biograph.html,"
Hungarian sculptor. After being apprenticed to his father, a locksmith, Ferenczy attended a course on copperplate engraving at the Vienna Academy where he was awarded for his medal ""Solon"". He was a pupil of Fischer and Kleiber at the Academy in 1817 where he learnt sculpture. In 1818 he made his way to Rome covering the distance on foot and spent six years on scholarship there. He worked in the workshop of Thorvaldsen, a Danish artist. He sent his first works (Reposing Venus, Portrait of Csokonai, Sheperdess or the Beginning of Fine Crafts) to Hungary and they brought him several scholarships and, as a result, he became Canova's pupil for two years. Full of plans, Ferenczy returned to Hungary in 1824.



"
1672,"FERENCZY, Károly","(b. 1862, Wien, d. 1917, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferenczz/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. It was not before completing his law studies and graduating from the College of Economy that Ferenczy took up painting, primarily as a result of his future wife's influence. After travelling in Italy, he began studying at the Julian Academy in Paris in 1887. In 1889 be moved to Szentendre, a small town near Budapest, and painted in naturalistic style showing the influence of Bastien-Lepage."
1673,"FERG, Franz de Paula","(b. 1689, Wien, d. 1740, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferg/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He studied landscape painting with his father, Adam Pankraz Ferg (1651-1729), and with Josef Orient (1677-1747) and staffage painting with Johann (Hans) Graf (1653-1710). He also studied the engravings of Jacques Callot and Sébastien Le Clerc the Elder. His early works show such subjects as harbours, markets and villages as wide vistas with many figures, trees and buildings, for example Fair with Temple and Maypole (Vienna, Belvedere). These scenes combine landscape and genre and are characteristic examples of early 18th-century Austrian panel painting, showing the influence of Dutch, Flemish and Italian models. The colours are dark, and the staffage figures in the manner of Graf are slender, with small heads and peculiarly wooden poses.



"
1674,"FERGUSON, William Gowe","(b. ca. 1633, Scotland, d. after 1695, Scotland)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferguson/biograph.html,"

William Gowe (or Gouw) Ferguson, Scottish painter, active also in the northern Netherlands. He was probably trained in Scotland but went to the Continent as a young man. He was in The Hague by 1660 and became a painter of still-life so much in the Dutch manner that he is often confused with painters like Jan Weenix. He also worked in Amsterdam and Utrecht. He also visited Italy."
1675,"FERNANDES, Mateus","(d. 1515, Batalha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernan/biograph.html,"
Portuguese architect, also called Mateus Fernandes the Elder. He was noted for his works in the Manueline style at the Monastery of Batalha."
1676,"FERNANDES, Vasco",(active 1500-1542 in Viseu),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernand/biograph.html,"
Vasco Fernandes, Portuguese Renaissance painter who worked in Viseu for at least 40 years, painted remarkable altarpieces. He became increasingly famous and revered with the passing of the centuries and came to be known by the name of Grão Vasco (the Great Vasco).

"
1677,"FERNÁNDEZ, Alejo","(b. ca. 1475, Cordoba, d. ca. 1545, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernande/alejo/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, probably of German extraction, as he is referred to as 'Maestro Alexos - pintor Aléman'. He married the daughter of a painter called Pedro Fernandez at Cordova and took her name, but he worked mainly at Seville, where he was the leading painter of the first third of the 16th century. His work, which is represented in Seville Cathedral, was essentially Flemish Mannerist in style, but it has a personal lyrical quality, and his treatment of architecture and perspective suggests that he may have visited Italy. He had a busy studio and several followers, among them his son Sebastián.



"
1678,"FERNÁNDEZ, Gregorio","(b. ca. 1576, d. 1636, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernande/gregorio/biograph.html,"
Gregório Fernandez (or Hernandez), Spanish sculptor, active at Valladolid from c.1605. Continuing the tradition of painted religious sculpture, he worked in the manner of Juan de Juni but with greater realism of expressive gesture. He was one of the first and greatest masters of Baroque naturalism in Spain, abandoning the earlier practice of using gold and brilliant colours and insisting upon realistic colouring from the polychromists who painted his sculptures. Among the numerous altarpieces emanating from his workshop are those of S. Miguel, Valladolid (1606) and Plasencia Cathedral (1624-34). He is well represented in Valladolid Museum.


"
1679,"FERNÁNDEZ, Juan",(d. 1657),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernande/juan/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, known as El Labrador, born at Jaraicejo, a small town in Extremadura. His sobriquet, El Labrador, derived from his preference for living in the country and coming only occasionally to Madrid, where clients often waited for months to receive his small canvases and panels of fruit and flowers. Of approximately 20 still-lifes referred to in documentary sources, the few that can be identified today justify the extravagant praise accorded them for generations after his death. In 1635 Sir Arthur Hopton, British envoy in Madrid, asked the artist to try his hand for the first time at flower painting. The small panel of a Vase of Flowers (1636; private collection) is the artist's only signed work (and records his true surname). It is exquisitely delicate in its chiaroscuro and muted colour and bears out the praise of Ceán Bermúdez, who described a similar pair (untraced) in the Spanish royal collection in 1800. A Still-life with Quinces and Acorns (London, Hampton Court, Royal Collection) was attributed to El Labrador in the inventory of 1639 of the collection of Charles I of England. Its dramatic lighting and satin-smooth chiaroscuro reveal the indirect influence of Caravaggio, as well as a horror vacui, which seems to have characterized El Labrador's compositions. Like other of his works, it has suffered from considerable darkening of certain pigments due to a faulty technique, which further exaggerates the relative contrast of light and dark."
1680,"FERNÁNDEZ, Pedro","(b. ca. 1480, Murcia, d. after 1521)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernande/pedro/biograph.html,"Spanish painter, born in Murcia, who until recently was known to art historians as ""Pseudo Bramantino"". He was the first Spanish painter to demonstrate a grasp of the Italian Renaissance style.

"
1681,"FERNANDI, Francesco","(b. 1679, Milano, d. 1740, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fernandi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, known as Imperiali. After studying with Carlo Vimercati (1600-c. 1715) in Milan, he travelled throughout Italy, painting for a period in Palermo. He arrived in Rome c. 1705 and was patronized by Cardinal Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, whose name he took. His earliest Roman works were small cabinet pictures of farmyard birds, animals and fish, such as roosters, rabbits and donkeys. Their naturalism and dark colour washes derive from a north Italian tradition and recall the art of Antonio Amorosi (1660-1738) or of Sinibaldo Scorza (1589-1631). In his small studies for conversation pieces he turned however to the art of Bologna and of Venice; their succinct handling and flickering light and shade are similar in style to Giuseppe Maria Crespi."
1682,"FERNELEY, John","(b. 1782, Thrussington, d. 1860, Melton Mowbray)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferneley/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was apprenticed to his father, a master wheelwright, until 1801 when, encouraged by John, 5th Duke of Rutland, he went to study in London with the sporting artist Benjamin Marshall. Little of Ben Marshall's broad and vigorous technique is evident in his pupil's later free and refined style, though some of Ferneley's early works, such as those painted on his visits to Ireland between 1808 and 1812 have echoes of his master."
1683,"FERRARI, Defendente","(b. ca. 1490, Chivasso, d. after 1531)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrari/defenden/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. It has been established through connoisseurship that he trained in the workshop of Giovanni Martino Spanzotti, who, after his move to Chivasso c. 1502, dominated painting in western Piedmont for some 30 years. Many of the works previously thought to have been by Spanzotti are now attributed to Defendente."
1684,"FERRARI, Gaudenzio","(b. ca. 1475, Valduggia, d. 1546, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrari/gaudenzi/biograph.html,"Italian painter, active in his native Piedmont and in Lombardy. Gaudenzio was an original and powerful artist, unduly neglected because much of his work is inaccessible. His early work was strongly intluenced by Leonardo and his Milanese followers, and throughout his life he remained eclectic, absorbing into his highly-charged, emotional style elements from Pordenone and Lotto and also, for example, from the engravings of Dürer. He was an artist of considerable power and individuality, but his work has remained comparatively little known because much of it is in fairly remote situations.

"
1685,"FERRARI, Giovanni Andrea de","(b. ca. 1598, Genova, d. 1669, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrari/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a prolific easel painter who painted many altarpieces and, with Gioacchino Assereto and Orazio de' Ferrari (1606-1657), created a lyrical, richly coloured manner that influenced the later development of the Genoese Baroque. He studied with Bernardo Castello (1557-1629), then with Bernardo Strozzi; he adopted Strozzi's manner so completely that his pictures were confused with those of his master. Some of these compositions survive, but they can usually be distinguished from Strozzi's by a thinner application of paint, expressive van Dyckian heads, tapered hands and tightly rolled drapery sleeves."
1686,"FERRARI, Giovanni","(b. 1744, Crespano del Grappa, d. 1826, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrari/giovannj/biograph.html,"

Luca Ferrari (called Luca da Reggio), Italian painter. The sources maintain that he was a pupil of Guido Reni, but to judge from the style of his earliest surviving works - the Miracle of Giovanni Francesco Vincenzo and the Miracle of Laura di Correggio (both c. 1626-27; Reggio Emilia, Madonna della Ghiara) - which show no hint of Reni's influence, he was more likely to have trained in his home town alongside the artists Leonello Spada, Alessandro Tiarini and Carlo Bononi, who in the 1610s and 1620s were decorating the basilica of the Madonna della Ghiara. He may well be the Luca who is mentioned in a Modenese document of 1627 as having assisted Tiarini. In 1635 he was documented in Padua, where he was a member of the 'Fraglia dei pittori' for two years and where he worked on the large canvas depicting St Dominic Imploring the Virgin to End the Plague (1635; Padua, Cassa di Risparmio) and other works on canvas (e.g. altarpieces painted in 1642 in S Francesco and S Tommaso) and in fresco (e.g. the funerary chapel (1640) of the de Lazara family at Conselve)."

1689,"FERRARI, Lorenzo de'","(b. 1680, Genova, d. 1744, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrari1/lorenzo/biograph.html,"
Italian Painter, son of Gregorio de' Ferrari, grandson of Domenico Piola. He evolved an independent style based on his grandfather's and father's work. He studied by making copies after the work of Guido Reni and Anthony van Dyck, and at the age of 12 he accompanied his father to Marseille, where he worked as his assistant. He probably also assisted Gregorio in the restoration of Andrea Ansaldo's dome in SS Annunziata, Genoa."
1690,"FERRATA, Ercole","(b. 1610, Como, d. 1686, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferrata/biograph.html,"Ferrata was an Italian Baroque sculptor who worked in Naples and Aquila before going to Rome, probably in the late 1640s, accompanied by his pupil Cafà. In 1647 he was working for Bernini in St Peter's, and in 1653 with Raggi on Bernini's Pimentel Tomb (Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome). Ferrata continued to work in San Nicola Tolentino which Algardi left unfinished at his death, and he also worked in Santa Agnese in Piazza Navona. Despite the connection, he never assimilated Bernini's style, retaining the classicism of Algardi and Bolognese painting.

Italian painter, the son of the goldsmith Antonio di Giovanni da Imola and Margherita di Domenico Gori. His mother’s family was influential in Florence and proved very important for Ferretti by helping his career. In the first years of his life he lived in Imola, where he was sent to study (1708) with the local painter Francesco Chiusuri. After the family moved to Florence, Ferretti was taught there by Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. Later he spent five years in Bologna, an important centre for the practice and teaching of academic painting, where he absorbed that city's well-known style of studying and drawing from nature. His work acquired its characteristic style in Bologna, in the workshop of Felice Torelli."
1692,"FERRI, Ciro","(b. ca. 1634, Roma, d. 1689, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, sculptor, architect and draughtsman. He was the most gifted pupil of Pietro da Cortona, and his style, in frescoes, easel paintings and drawings, remained a remarkably true interpretation of the latter's Roman Baroque. The work of the two artists is at times so close that attributions, especially among their drawings, have often been confused. In his designs for sculpture, architecture and decorative ornament, Ferri was indebted to both Cortona and Bernini. Ferri's art was important in spreading the decorative style of the Roman Baroque to Florence and to other cities.



"
1693,"FERRI, Antonio Maria","(b. 1651, Firenze, d. 1716, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ferri_a/biograph.html,"

Italian sculptor and architect, also known as Andrea da Fiesole, member of a family of artists, first cousin of Francesco di Simone Ferrucci. According to Vasari, he learnt the rudiments of his art from Francesco and completed his training under Michele Maini from Fiesole, of whom nothing else is known. His style was rooted in the realistic tradition of the late 15th century. As he matured it was modified, but only slightly, by the classical trends of the 16th century. He was in Naples in 1487, he may have lived there for several years, possibly engaged on different projects for King Ferdinand I through his promotion by the King's architect and military engineer, Antonio di Giorgio Marchesi (1451-1522) from Settignano, whose daughter he married."

Italian sculptor, member of a family of artists. Francesco was probably trained by his father, Simone di Nanni Ferrucci (b. 1402), and was decisively influenced by Desiderio da Settignano and Andrea del Verrocchio. Vasari named him among the pupils of Verrocchio, and it is possible that in the 1470s he assisted the master. He matriculated in the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e di Legname, the Florentine sculptors' guild, in 1463 and established a workshop in Florence in 1466. By 1470, when he first submitted a catasto (land registry declaration), he was married and owned a house in Florence. "

From 1580 Paolo produced several series of paintings for the German banker and patron Hans Fugger (e.g. the Nine Planets, 1592; Munich, Alte Pinakothek). Paolo remained based in Venice, where he eventually opened a successful studio.

His most original works were easel pictures, for private collectors, often of cruel and violent subjects, which he interpreted with a morbid sensuality and ambiguous tenderness. He was brought to Florence when very young by the collector Conte Alberto Bardi (d 1632), who arranged for him to study with Jacopo da Empoli and to copy works by Andrea del Sarto. Ficherelli's clear compositions and luminous drapery, which remain evident throughout his career, reflect this training."
1707,"FIDANI, Orazio","(b. ca. 1610, Firenze, d. ca. 1656, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fidani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Giovanni Bilivert, and according to art historian Houbraken worked in the workshop of his master for twelve years and has worked with Francesco Furini."
1708,"FIGINO, Giovanni Ambrogio","(b. ca. 1551, Milano, d. 1608, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/figino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. A pupil of Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, he was one of the most important artists working in Milan during the second half of the 16th century. His career, however, is poorly documented. His chief achievement, both in quantity and quality, was as a draughtsman, but he was also a very able portrait painter, highly popular with the nobility. His earliest known work is in fact a portrait of Angelo Dannona, signed and dated 1570 (private collection). The courtly style of his portraits is evident in two other surviving works: Lucio Foppa (c. 1585; Milan, Brera), shown in a noble and dignified pose, proudly attired in elegant shining armour against a dark background, and the Portrait of a Member of the Cavalcabo Family (c. 1580; Rome, Palazzo Venezia). Here the subject is depicted in a half-length pose, turned three-quarters towards the right, his hand boldly placed on his hip. His gaze is deep and penetrating, his attitude courtly."
1709,"FIGUEIREDO, Cristóvano",(active 1515-1543),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/figueire/biograph.html,"
Portuguese painter. He was a pupil of Jorge Afonso and worked with Garcia Fernandes and Gregório Lopes, though each of their styles was personal and independent. He was one of the most esteemed painters of his time and received many royal commissions, but it is not known if he was ever officially appointed court painter. He is known to have made drawings for other artists, and in 1537 he was commissioned to make cartoons for tapestries that were to be woven in Flanders.



"
1710,"FIGUEROA, Leonardo de","(b. ca.1650, Utiel, d. 1730, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/figueroa/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. He was active in Seville where all his known building are located, featuring yellow or white cut brickwork framed with red, glazed tiles. He favoured Solomonic columns, estípites, elaborately contorted cornices, and much statuary and carved decoration, all mingled in unbridled freedom, with occasional touches of mudéjar ornament."
1711,FILARETE,"(b. ca. 1400, Firenze, d. 1469, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/filarete/biograph.html,"
Filarete (Antonio di Pietro Averlino), Florentine sculptor, architect and writer on art. His nickname is derived from the Greek for 'lover of virtue'. He probably trained with Ghiberti and his most important work in sculpture - the pair of bronze doors of St Peter's in Rome (1433-45) which include scenes from the life of Pope Eugenius IV - are heavily indebted to Ghiberti's doors for the Baptistery in Florence, although much less accomplished. After being expelled from Rome for allegedly stealing a relic, Filarete went to Florence and Venice, then in 1450 settled in Milan. There he worked mainly as an architect, his principal work being the Ospedale Maggiore (begun 1457, completed in the 18th century), which helped to introduce the Renaissance style to Lombardy and created new standards of comfort and sanitation in hospital design.

"
1712,FILIPPO DA VERONA,(active 1509-1522),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/filippo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter who painted in a style recalling Cima da Conegliano. He is the author of a Virgin and Child in the Academy of Arts in Turin. In 1510, he participated in the fresco decoration of the Sala Capitolare in the Scuola del Santo in Padua. The scene St Anthony Appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi is his first documentable and securely dated painting."
1713,"FILLOEUL, Pierre","(b. 1696, Abbeville, d. after 1754, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/filloeul/biograph.html,"
French printmaker. He was the son and pupil of the engraver Gilbert Filloeul (1644-1714). His oeuvre extends from 1731 to 1754 and numbers c. 150 prints. He sometimes sold his works himself, but his principal publishers were Nicolas Larmessin, Pierre Roguié and Michel Odieuvre, who in 1738 brought out his Recueil des portraits de rois de France (60 plates). Beside portraits, Filloeul engraved illustrations for Jean de La Fontaine's Contes."
1714,"FINCH, Alfred William","(b. 1854, Bruxelles, d. 1930, Helsinki)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/finch/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter and potter. He studied painting at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts et Ecole des Arts Décoratifs in Brussels from 1878 to 1880. He was a founder-member of Les XX, a group of 20 avant-garde artists who held annual exhibitions of paintings and decorative arts between 1884 and 1895. Initially Finch painted land- and seascapes in the Impressionist style."
1715,"FINÉ, Oronce","(b. 1494, Briançon, d. 1555, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fine/biograph.html,"
French astronomer, cartographer and mathematician. He was  educated in Paris and obtained a degree in medicine in 1522. He spent time in prison in 1518 and again in 1524, probably for practicing judicial astrology. In 1531, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Collége Royal, where he taught until his death. His most notable works are Arithmetica Pratica, printed in Paris in 1530 and reprinted in 1544, and the Protomathesis (in 15 books), published in 1532. He is also famous for trying to square the circle and was one of the first mathematicians to use decimal numbers.



"
1716,"FINELLI, Giuliano","(b. 1601, Carrara, d. 1653, Rome)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/finelli/biograph.html,"
Finelli came from a family of stonemasons in Carrara and trained in Naples before entering Bernini's workshop in 1622. His prowess in carving marble was put to use by Bernini on some of the more astonishing passages of the early groups and portraits, but the two men fell out when Bernini did not award him one of the four statues for the crossing of St Peter's. Finelli eventually left Rome for Naples in 1634 and enjoyed many productive years there, creating a notable series of saints for the cathedral church of San Gennaro. "
1717,"FINIGUERRA, Maso","(b. 1426, Firenze, d. 1464, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/finiguer/biograph.html,"
Maso (originally Tommaso) Finiguerra, Italian Renaissance goldsmith, engraver, draftsman and designer. He is known for his work in niello, a type of decorative metalwork, and as one of the first major Italian printmakers."
1718,"FINOGLIA, Paolo Domenico","(b. ca. 1590, Napoli, d. 1645, Conversano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/finoglia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He signed himself Neapolitanus and probably trained in Naples under the late Mannerist painter Ippolito Borghese (d 1627). Borghese's influence, though lasting, was not as strong as that of Caravaggio, whose art Finoglia came to admire. His work before 1626 is exemplified by the ten lunettes representing the Founders of Religious Orders in the Sala Capitolare (1620-c. 1626) of the Certosa di S Martino, Naples, which demonstrate his accomplished blending of late Mannerist and Caravaggesque styles. The Circumcision (1626), also in the Sala Capitolare, reveals the strong influence of Battistello Caracciolo, as does Finoglia's first important work in fresco, the decoration of the chapel of S Martino in the Certosa di S Martino with scenes from the Life of St Martin (c. 1632), which were provided to accompany Caracciolo's altarpiece of St Martin (1622-6) already in the chapel. Caracciolo's influence was lasting, observable later in the Baptism of St Celsus (c. 1635; Pozzuoli Cathedral)."
1719,"FINSON, Louis","(b. ca. 1580, Brugge, d. 1617, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/finson/biograph.html,"
Louis Finson (also Ludovicus Finsonius), Flemish painter. He was the son of the painter Jacques Fynson (d before 1609) and trained in his father's studio in Bruges; the influence of Netherlandish Mannerism is strong in his work. At some time early in the 17th century he travelled to Italy; he was certainly in Naples by 1608 and may also have previously spent some time in Rome. It is not certain whether he was a pupil of Caravaggio, but he is known to have copied many of Caravaggio's works and to have owned at least two of his paintings, one of which was the Madonna of the Rosary (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum), which Finson bought with Abraham Vinck (1580-1621), perhaps as early as 1607."
1720,"FIORAVANTI, Aristotele","(b. ca. 1417, Bologna, d. ca. 1485, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fioravan/biograph.html,"
Italian engineer and architect, active also in Russia, also known as Aristotile da Bologna. The son of a local mason, Fieravante di Ridolfo (c. 1390-1430), Aristotele initially worked as a goldsmith. He secured notoriety as an engineer in 1455 first for transporting the campanile known as the Torre della Mangione (destroyed 1825) of Santa Maria del Tempio, Bologna, to a new site 18 m away, then for straightening the leaning campanile (destroyed 18th century) of San Biagio, Cento, and finally for straightening the leaning campanile of Sant'Angelo, Venice, which collapsed directly afterwards."
1721,FIORENZO DI LORENZO,"(b. ca. 1445, Perugia, d. ca. 1522, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fiorenzo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect. The earliest reliable document to mention him is dated 20 May 1463, when he was appointed in place of his father, Lorenzo di Cecco, to vote for the Capitano del Popolo. Between 1463 and 1469 his name appears on the register of painters of Perugia. In 1470 he was treasurer of the painters' guild, and in 1472 he was elected its prior for November-December. On 9 December that year the Sylvestrine monks of Santa Maria Nuova, Perugia, commissioned him to paint a double-sided polyptych (Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Perugia) for the main altar of their church; he did not complete it until 1493. From the tenor of the contract and the substantial sum agreed - 225 ducats - it appears that Fiorenzo was then considered the best of the young painters working in Perugia. In 1476, while the plague was becoming increasingly rampant, he painted a fresco of the Madonna of Mercy (Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Perugia) for the hospital of S. Egidio (destroyed), Perugia. Originally signed and dated, the work is badly damaged but remains of fundamental importance for understanding the art of Fiorenzo's early maturity. While its subject is characteristic of local plague banners, its style is directly related to Florentine art of the same period, for example in its use of the perspective device of square paving stones. Other elements recall the ambience of the Rossellini brothers and Andrea del Verrocchio, especially the motif of the angels flying overhead."
1722,"FISCHBACH, Johann","(b. 1797, Grafenegg, d. 1871, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fischbac/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied in Vienna at the Akademie der bildenden Künste with Joseph Mössmer (1780-1845). He made a study tour in Germany and Switzerland in 1825. He joined the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna in 1836. He was in Rome in 1837. Between 1840 and 1860 he stayed in Salzburg where he joined the committee promoting the foundation of the Salzburg Arts Society in 1844. He ran a ""small academy"" for art-loving amateurs, and he gave painting lessons to the young Hans Makart (1840-1884). He moved to Munich in 1860."
1723,"FISCHER, Johann Martin","(b. 1740, Bebele, d. 1820, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fischer/biograph.html,"
Austrian sculptor. He was a poor peasant's son who was apprenticed to a village sculptor in the Allgäu region. He then worked in Vienna for ten years as an assistant to the sculptors Anton Tabota (1724-76), Jakob Christoph Schletterer (1699-1774) and Franz Xaver Messerschmidt. At the same time he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste. His first independent works, dating from the mid-1770s, include a statue of Mucius Scaevola (marble, 1773) for Schönbrunn Park, and two side altars (1775-76) for the cathedral in Pécs. It was not until the 1780s that Fischer became a recognized and sought-after artist in Vienna."
1724,"FISCHER VON ERLACH, Johann Bernhard","(b. 1656, Graz, d. 1723, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fischere/biograph.html,"
Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (the honorific was granted by the emperor in 1696 when Fischer was ennobled) was an Austrian architect, member of a family of architects. He was the son of Johann Baptist Fischer, a sculptor and decorator active in Graz, near the Austrian border with Italy. Johann Bernhard became the last great architect of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, occupying a central role in the buildings of the imperial court circle in Vienna. His eclectic approach was adopted as the official style of the Habsburg court. His second son, Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach (1695-1742), was trained by his father as his successor and completed his unfinished work after his death."
1725,"FISCHER, Josef Vinzenz","(b. 1729, Schmidham bei Griesbach, d. 1810, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fischerj/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna in 1749 and 1765. After travelling to Italy in 1753 to study, he worked briefly in Bavaria, then settled permanently in Vienna. He painted a series of frescoes and altarpieces in Austria, Hungary, Moravia and Bohemia, but also worked as a painter of historical subjects, painting small mythological and allegorical works. Among the most important frescoes for which he was solely responsible is the ceiling painting, in the temple of Diana at Schloss Laxenburg, of Agamemnon Hunting (1763; preparatory sketch, Vienna, Belvedere)."
1726,"FISCHER, Johann Michael","(b. 1692, Burglengenfeld, d. 1766, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fischerm/biograph.html,"

1727,"FLAMEN, Anselme","(b. 1647, St Omer, Pas-de-Calais, d. 1717, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flamen/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. A pupil of Gaspard Marsy, he studied at the Académie de France in Rome from 1675 to 1679. On his return he was employed to carve decorative stone sculptures on the façades of the château of Versailles, including a statue of Erato (1681-82; in situ). In 1681 he was received (reçu) as a member of the Académie Royale with an oval bas-relief of St Jerome (marble; Versailles, Notre-Dame). He assisted Marsy with a number of fountains and groups for the gardens at Versailles and after Marsy's death completed from his models the tomb of Anne, Duc de Noailles for St Paul, Paris (marble and bronze, 1683; destroyed), and the group Rape of Oreithyia by Boreas for Versailles (marble, 1684-87; Paris, Louvre). He made numerous contributions to the royal building projects of the reign of Louis XIV, including a copy of the antique group Faun with a Kid (marble, 1685-6) and a statue of Cyparissus (marble, 1687) for the gardens at Versailles (both in situ), as well as stucco decoration for the Salon de l'Oeil de Boeuf (1701; in situ) within the palace and statues of St Philip, St Bartholomew and St Irenaeus (stone, 1707; in situ) for the exterior of the chapel.



"
1728,"FLAMENG, François","(b. 1856, Paris, d. 1923, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flameng/biograph.html,"
French painter, engraver and illustrator. He was the son of an engraver and received a first-rate education in his craft. As a successful history painter and portraitist he became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He decorated such important civic buildings as the Sorbonne and the Opéra Comique, and also produced advertising work. Flameng was granted France's highest civilian honour, the Légion d'Honneur, and designed France's first bank notes."
1729,"FLANDRIN, Hippolyte","(b. 1809, Lyon, d. 1864, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flandrin/biograph.html,"
French painter and lithographer, part of a family of artists, brother of Auguste and Paul Flandrin. He was initially discouraged from fulfilling his early wish to become an artist by Auguste's lack of success, but in 1821 the sculptor Denys Foyatier, an old family friend, persuaded both Hippolyte and Paul to train as artists. He introduced them to the sculptor Jean-François Legendre-Héral (1796-1851) and the painter André Magnin (1794-1823), with whom they worked copying engravings and plaster casts. Hippolyte and Paul had both learnt the techniques of lithography from Auguste at an early age, and between the ages of 14 and 19 Hippolyte produced a number of lithographs, which he sold to supplement the family income. Many reflected his passion for military subjects."
1730,"FLAXMAN, John","(b. 1755, York, d. 1826, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flaxman/biograph.html,"
English sculptor, draughtsman, and designer, an outstanding figure of the Neoclassical movement. He was the son of a moulder of plaster figures, and after studying at the Royal Academy School (where he met his life-long friend Blake) he worked for the potter Josiah Wedgwood from 1775 to 1787. The designs he produced for Wedgwood not only strengthened his interest in antique art but also developed the innate sensitivity to line that was his greatest gift. At the same time he gradually built up a practice as a sculptor."
1731,"FLEGEL, Georg","(b. 1566, Olomouc, d. 1638, Frankfurt am Main)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flegel/biograph.html,"
German painter. He acquired citizen's rights in Frankfurt in 1597 and stayed there until he died. He worked a lot together with the Fleming Lucas van Valckenborch. Flegel is considered to be the most important representative of early modern German still-lifes. He specialized in so-called meals, banquet, breakfast and flower still-lifes.



"
1732,"FLÉMAL, Bertholet","(b. 1614, Liège, d. 1675, Liège)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flemal/biograph.html,"
Franco-Flemish painter and architect. He was born into a family of artists, and his first apprenticeship was probably in Liège with his father, Renier Flémal (b 1585), a painter of stained glass. Bertholet was later a pupil of Henri Trippet (c. 1600–74) before completing his training during the 1630s with Gérard Douffet. In 1638 Flémal went to Rome and on the return journey visited Florence and stayed for some time in Paris. He had returned to Liège by 1646. Flémal had a successful career there, painting for private collectors, but he was also commissioned to work for the many religious establishments. His patron was Canon Lambert de Liverloo, Chancellor to the Prince-Bishop of Liège. In addition, Flémal made designs for religious buildings and fittings as well as for his own house, but none of this architectural work has survived."
1733,"FLINCK, Govert Teunisz.","(b. 1615, Kleve, d. 1660, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flinck/biograph.html,"
Dutch Baroque painter of portraits, genre, and narrative subjects, one of Rembrandt's most accomplished followers."
1734,"FLORIGERIO, Sebastiano","(b. ca. 1500, Conegliano, d. 1543, Udine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/floriger/biograph.html,"
Sebastiano Florigerio (also Florigorio), Italian painter pupil and probably son-in-law of Pellegrino da San Daniele. He was active in Udine (from 1524), Padua, and Cividale, and elsewhere. He was one of the gifted Friulian masters, yet some of his figures look as though they have been cut out of other paintings and inserted into a new scene. Some of his work is reminiscent of Dossi.


"
1735,"FLORIS, Cornelis","(b. 1514, Antwerpen, d. 1575, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/floris/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Floris, Cornelis II and Frans, the most distinguished members of a family of Flemish artists; their Antwerp workshops contributed significantly to the Northern Renaissance. Cornelis was an architect, sculptor, and medalist; Frans, a painter."
1736,"FLORIS, Frans","(b. ca. 1516, Antwerpen, d. 1570, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/floris/frans/biograph.html,"
Floris, Cornelis II and Frans, the most distinguished members of a family of Flemish artists; their Antwerp workshops contributed significantly to the Northern Renaissance. Cornelis was an architect, sculptor, and medalist; Frans, a painter. Both brothers studied in Rome in the 1540s and were soon at the head of flourishing workshops in Antwerp."
1737,"FLÖTNER, Peter","(b. ca. 1485, Thurgau, d. 1546, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flotner/biograph.html,"
Peter Flötner (Flettner), German sculptor, medallist, cabinetmaker, woodcutter and designer. It has been conjectured on stylistic grounds that between 1515 and 1518 he was active in Augsburg and worked in Hans Daucher's workshop on the sculptural decoration (destroyed) of the Fugger funerary chapel in St Anna. His early style was formed by the Italianism of Daucher and of Hans Burgkmair and also by a journey to Italy in 1520-21. He was briefly active in Ansbach before arriving in 1522 in Nuremberg; there he was documented as master sculptor when receiving citizenship in August 1523."
1738,"FLURER, Franz Ignaz","(b. 1688, Augsburg, d. 1742, Graz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/flurer/biograph.html,"
German painter. He trained (1701-06) with the Augsburg painter Johann Rieger (fl 1690; d 1730). By 1720 he was employed by Graf Ignaz Maria Attems (d 1732) to paint canvases and Baroque frescoes for his castles at Slovenska Bistrica (1720-21) and Brezice (1722-27), Slovenia, and at Gösting (1728-29; destroyed), near Graz. He also painted frescoes for the Kursaal at Tobelbad (1732; in situ) and for a garden pavilion at Schloss Brunnsee (Allegory of Agriculture, 1733; in situ). His landscapes depict ports, travellers and Graf Attems's castles. His religious works were executed mainly for churches in Graz, including St Giles (1730-33) for the main altar in Graz Cathedral. His compositions were derived from those of the Augsburg painter Melchior Seidl (1657-1727) and from Annibale Carracci and Pietro da Cortona's frescoes in Rome; his landscapes were influenced by Italian art, especially that of the Venetians Marco Ricci and Luca Carlevaris, and by the Dutch painter Pieter Mulier.

"
1740,"FOGELBERG, Bengt Erland","(b. 1786, Göteborg, d. 1854, Trieste)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fogelber/biograph.html,"
Swedish sculptor and archaeologist. He studied from 1803 at the Kungliga Akademi för de Fria Konsterna, Stockholm, where he joined those who opposed its conservative method of education. He belonged to the influential circles in early 19th-century Swedish art and literature that promoted a more realistic style and Romantic subject-matter, in particular Old Norse themes. In 1818 Fogelberg successfully exhibited plaster sketches of Odin, Thor and Frey (Ulriksdal, nr Stockholm, Orangerie Museum). They were the starting-points for Fogelberg's most celebrated monumental works, which were executed much later in marble (in a greatly revised state), commissioned by Karl XIV Johan (reg 1818-44): Odin was produced in 1830 and Thor and Balder in 1844 (all Ulriksdal, nr Stockholm, Orangerie Museum). The works derive from antique sculptures, but in Odin and Thor Fogelberg conveyed in a personal way a realistic and slightly barbaric power that corresponded to the contemporary view of these figures as the Nordic equivalents of Jupiter and Mars."
1741,"FOGGINI, Giambattista","(b. 1652, Firenze, d. 1725, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/foggini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. The foremost Florentine sculptor of the late Baroque period, he was first apprenticed to two painters successively but soon showed a greater propensity for sculpture. He was sent to Rome as one of the first pupils of the Florentine Academy there by Grand Duke Cosimo III in 1673. His three years' study  encompassed drawing with Pietro da Cortona's former pupil Ciro Ferri as well as modelling and carving with Ercole Ferrata. Among his tasks were the copying of paintings in relief as well as compositions by Ferrata; consequently, Foggini's approach to narrative was indirectly tinctured by examples of Pietro da Cortona and Algardi. His precocious ability at this period is demonstrated in a terracotta relief of the Slaying of the Niobids (Museo Opificio Pietre Dure, Florence); a marble relief of the Adoration of the Shepherds (The Hermitage, St Petersburg); and a bronze relief of the Crucifixion (Palazzo Pitti, Florence), until recently ascribed to the court sculptor of the day, Ferdinando Tacca. These early works established his characteristic style, a novel late Baroque manner that changed little throughout his career."
1742,"FOGOLINO, Marcello","(b. ca. 1485, Vicenza, d. after 1548)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fogolino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. The son of Francisco, a painter from Friuli, he was trained in Vicenza, in the workshop of Bartolomeo Montagna. Although he was in Venice between c. 1508 and 1516, it was Montagna's retardataire style belonging to the 15th century that proved the decisive influence in Fogolino's early works, for example the Virgin and Child with Saints (c. 1513-15; The Hague, Mauritshuis). Between 1521 and 1524 he worked in Friuli, where his St Francis with Sts Daniel and John the Baptist (c. 1522; Pordenone Cathedral), with its asymmetrical arrangement and bulky, powerfully modelled figure types, shows him responding quickly to Pordenone's dynamic style."
1743,"FOHR, Carl Philipp","(b. 1775, Heidelberg, d. 1818, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fohr/biograph.html,"
German painter and draughtsman. His first drawing lessons, from the age of 13, were from Friedrich Rottmann (1768-1816), the father of the painter Carl Rottmann. In 1810 the Darmstadt Court Councillor, Georg Wilhelm Issel, discovered Fohr sketching at Stift Neuberg near Heidelberg and, the following year, invited him to Darmstadt and provided encouragement and financial support. From 1813 Fohr carried out commissions for Grand Duchess Wilhelmina of Hesse, for whom he produced a Sketchbook of the Neckar Region, a collection of views and historical subjects (30 watercolours; 1813-14) and also a Baden Sketchbook (30 watercolours, 1814-15; both Darmstadt, Hessischen Landesmuseums). These far surpassed the usual level attained in this genre in their sharpness of detail, delicacy of colour and pictorial inventiveness. The Crown Princess granted him an annual pension of 500 guilders. From July 1815 to May 1816, Fohr was a student of landscape painting at the Kunstakademie in Munich, and it was here that his breakthrough into an independent and ingenious drawing style came about."
1744,"FOLIOT, Nicolas-Quinibert","(b. 1706, Paris, d. 1776, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/foliot/biograph.html,"
French chairmaker. For 40 years he ran a family workshop in Paris, supplying huge numbers of chairs (in one year 468 chairs and 135 armchairs) to the court. He eventually became the royal furniture-maker (menuisier du garde-meuble du roi), and was the creator of the Louis XVI style of chairs. As furniture for the crown was not marked, there are sometimes difficulties of attribution, but at least one set of chairs at Versailles is known to have come from his workshop, and the Musée du Louvre has at least two of his chairs.



"
1745,"FONDULI, Giovanni Paolo",(active 1468-1484 in Padua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fonduli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor (also known as Giovanni da Crema). A contract dated 29 November 1469, written by Fonduli himself, has survived, stipulating the execution of three all'antica terracotta altarpieces for a church to be built in the Castello at Este. From Fonduli's handwriting and Venetian dialect, it can be deduced that he had had some education and that he had probably worked outside of Crema, in Padua. In a later contract of 3 March 1484, Fonduli agreed to create a bronze relief for the Paduan church of Il Santo. (Bronze was the medium preferred by Fonduli.)"
1746,"FONTAINE, Pierre-François-Léonard","(b. 1762, Cergy, d. 1853, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontaine/biograph.html,"
French architect and interior designer, partner with Charles Percier. This pair of architects redesigned the Tuileries Palace, Paris, and Saint-Cloud, for the Emperor Napoleon from circa 1801 to 1804. They were named ""architectes du gouvernement"" by Napoleon in 1801 and ""Architectes du Louvre et des Tuileries"" in 1804. They helped create the influential Empire style of interior decoration."
1747,"FONTANA, Domenico","(b. 1543, Melide, d. 1607, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontan/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He went to Rome, where he built (c. 1580) the Sistine Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore for Cardinal Peretti. When his patron was made pope (Sixtus V), Fontana played a leading part in the great rebuilding of Rome. He designed the Lateran palace (1588) and portions of the Vatican, notably the library (1588). An engineer as well as an architect, he built, with his elder brother Giovanni (1540-1614), the great aqueduct and fountain known as the Acqua Felice (1587) and in 1586 erected the obelisk in front of St. Peter's, a feat that won him wide renown. With Giacomo della Porta, he completed the dome of St. Peter's. On the death of Sixtus V, Fontana's Roman career collapsed; he withdrew to Naples, where he built the imposing royal palace (1600) and where he died before the execution of his magnificent designs for the improvement of the harbour.



"
1748,"FONTANA, Lavinia","(b. 1552, Bologna, d. 1614, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontana/lavinia/biograph.html,"
Italian woman painter, daughter and pupil of Prospero Fontana. She began her career in Bologna. She painted portraits and religious pictures, her earliest recorded work being the Holy Family of 1525 (Dresden). In 1577 she married a rich pupil of her father's, Gian Paolo Zappi, who became her assistant. Despite having eleven children she enjoyed a successful career, working in a style close to Correggio and Parmigianino in her religious works (often of considerable size), and to the Florentine Mannerists in her portraits. She moved to Rome in 1603, at the invitation of Pope Clement VIII, and died there.



"
1749,"FONTANA, Prospero","(b. 1512, Bologna, d. 1597, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontana/prospero/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters and draughtsmen, active mostly in Bologna and Rome. The majority of his work belongs to the Mannerist tradition which originated in Rome and Florence in the 1520s, but disseminated more widely within Italy following the sack of Rome in 1527. Prospero Fontana was the leading Bolognese exponent of Mannerism."
1750,"FONTANA, Annibale","(b. 1540, Milano, d. 1587, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontanaa/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, hardstone-engraver and sculptor. He came from a family of Swiss origin, from Ticino, and was active mainly in Milan. According to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, his great friend, Fontana in his early career, before 1570, was active mainly making medals and engraving on rock crystal and hardstones (pietre dure). Based on references in Lomazzo, portrait medals of Francesco Ferdinando d'Avalos and Lomazzo have been attributed to Fontana. The status and occupations of the subjects of his medals indicate that Fontana was in contact with patrons of high rank and with the intellectual circles of Milan. Stylistically, the three medals derive from Leone Leoni and Jacopo da Trezzo I (c. 1517-1589), and these influences continued in his work."
1751,"FONTANA, Carlo","(b. 1634, Brusata, d. 1714, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontanac/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and engineer. Born in Lombardy, he arrived in Rome in the 1650s. In 1666, he became the ""misuratore della R. Fabbrica di S. Pietro,"" and in 1697, he became the architect of Saint Peter's, Rome."
1752,"FONTANA, Flaminio",(active after 1574 in Urbino),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontanaf/biograph.html,"
Flaminio Fontana was part of an Italian family of potters. The workshop founder, Guido Durantino (died c. 1576), was established as a potter in Urbino by 1519 and by 1553 had adopted the name Fontana. His three sons, Nicolò Fontana (died 1565), Camillo Fontana (died 1589) and Orazio Fontana (c. 1510-1576), also took part in the business, as did Nicolò's son Flaminio Fontana. The workshop was one of the most influential in the area during the 16th century.



"
1753,"FONTANA, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1524, Ala, d. 1587, Innsbruck)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontanag/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, draughtsmen and printmakers, active in Austria. His training was based on the works of such masters as Titian and Veronese, and his activity in Austria, documented from 1562, comprised substantial decorative projects and altarpieces, drawings and numerous engravings. In 1562 he and his brother Giulio Fontana (active 1562–1578) executed frescoes (destroyed) in the chapel of Schloss Kaiser-Ebersdorf in Vienna; in 1573 he was in Innsbruck, where he settled and in 1575 became court painter to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria."
1754,"FONTANESI, Antonio","(b. 1818, Reggio Emilia, d. 1882, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontanes/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In 1832, at the age of 14, he began attending the local Scuola di Belle Arti where he was a pupil of Prospero Minghetti (1786-1853). Fontanesi's early work revealed his versatility: in the 1830s he produced tempera murals for several houses in Reggio Emilia, such as the Casa Zanichelli, Via S Filippo (in situ), and the Casa Ghinizzini, Via Emilia Santo Stefano (in situ), combining townscapes and architectural perspectives with friezes and medallions in an 18th-century manner. For the 1841-42 and 1845-46 theatre seasons he designed stage sets for performances of operas, including Verdi's Nabucco, performed in the Teatro Comunale. He began painting landscapes in this period."
1755,"FONTEBASSO, Francesco","(b. 1707, Venezia, d. 1769, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fontebas/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, printmaker and draughtsman, the last outstanding representative of Italian monumental painting. He was one of the most prolific and well-known followers of Sebastiano Ricci, with whom he had his earliest training, and particularly of Giambattista Tiepolo."
1756,"FOPPA, Vincenzo","(b. 1427/30, Brescia, d. 1515/16, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/foppa/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the leading figure in Lombard painting until the arrival of Leonardo da Vinci in Milan in 1481/2. He was born and died in Brescia, but was active mainly in Milan. According to Vasari he obtained his training in Padua, and his robust style owed much to Mantegna, not least in his interest in perspective. His major works include frescos in S. Eustorgio, Milan, and Sta Maria del Carmine, Brescia.



"
1757,"FORABOSCO, Girolamo","(b. 1605, Venezia, d. 1679, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/forabosc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was active in Padua and Venice, where he was enrolled in the Fraglia dei Pittori between 1634 and 1639 and paid taxes from 1640 to 1644. His early work, such as the portrait of the so-called Menichina (1624; Rome, Palazzo Barberini), was influenced by that of Padovanino (Alessandro Varotari), who had revived the style of Titian. He also adopted compositional and formal schemes from Tiberio Tinelli, as in the Portrait of a Woman (private collection). The large canvas of the Miraculous Rescue (1646; Malamocco, S Maria Assunta), commissioned by Giovanni Ventura as an ex-voto for his escape from a shipwreck, shows Forabosco, unconstrained by the narrative and devotional character premises of the undertaking, creating a tender portrait group, distinguished by its spontaneity. The most striking quality of his work is its combination of physiognomic exactitude with free, fluid brushwork."
1758,"FORAIN, Jean-Louis","(b. 1852, Rheims, d. 1931, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/forain/biograph.html,"
French painter, lithographer, and caricaturist. One of the foremost etchers of his day, Forain is best known for his political cartoons and social satires, particularly of the worlds of theater and courtroom. His work combines the realism of Manet with the satire of Daumier, it enlivened a large number of publications, including Vie moderne, Cravache, Parisien, Figaro, and the New York Herald. In 1898 he founded with Caran d'Ache the short-lived Psst."
1759,"FORD, Edward Onslow","(b. 1852, London, d. 1901, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/ford/biograph.html,"
English sculptor. He studied painting for a short time at the Antwerp Academy in 1870. He decided to take up sculpture while studying under Michael Wagmüller (1839-1881) at Munich in 1871-74. On his return to London he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy from 1875, and at the Grosvenor Gallery from 1879."
1760,"FORMENT, Damian","(b. ca. 1480, Valencia, d. 1540, Logrono)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/forment/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He is recorded in Valencia from 1500. In 1509 he moved to Saragossa to work on the main retable in the cathedral of Nuestra Senora del Pilar, which is modelled on the Gothic altarpiece in the cathedral of La Seo, Saragossa. The Pilar retable, one of Forment's noblest works, is made in alabaster and has three vertical sections surmounted by Gothic cresting and a central open section that houses the tabernacle (sagrario). The sculpture includes Forment's self-portrait and that of his wife, as well as reliefs on the base and main body depicting the Presentation, the Assumption and the Birth of the Virgin that show his knowledge of Renaissance art."
1761,"FORNENBURGH, Jan Baptist van","(b. ca. 1585, Antwerpen, d. 1649, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fornenbu/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, born in Antwerp and settled in The Hague. He specialised in painting on vellum highly decorative bouquets of flowers, or more humble floral subjects, often accompanied by small animals, even insects.



"
1762,"FORRESTER, James","(b. 1730, Dublin, d. 1776, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/forreste/biograph.html,"
Irish painter. He was a pupil of Robert West (died 1770) in the school in George's Lane, Dublin in 1747, and received premiums from the Dublin Society in that year and in 1750. In 1752 he won the first prize for drawing in the annual competition in the school. He settled in Rome in 1755 and spent the last twenty years of his life there."
1763,"FORTE, Luca","(b. ca. 1615, Napoli, d. ca. 1670, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/forte/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He specialized in still-lifes, and although only a few of his signed or initialed works survive, he is nonetheless regarded as a main exponent of the genre. He is particularly significant for having introduced the naturalism of Caravaggio into still-life painting in Naples. His development was influenced by the work of contemporary specialists in Rome, such as Tommaso Salini, Giovanni Battista Crescenzi and Pietro Paolo Bonzi, and by the work of certain Spanish artists, especially Blas de Ledesma and Juan van der Hamen. De Dominici wrote of Forte as being older than Paolo Porpora, which would place him at the very start of still-life painting in 17th-century Naples."
1764,"FORTINI, Davide",(d. 1590),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fortini/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Tuscany. He was originally from San Casciano in Val di Pesa, but his birth date is not known. He was the son-in-law of Tribolo, whose eldest daughter Dianora he married, and began his career working under the guidance of his father-in-law."
1765,"FORTUNY Y MARSAL, Mariano","(b. 1838, Reus, d. 1874, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fortuny/biograph.html,"
Spanish (Catalan) painter and etcher. (His name in Catalan is Marià Fortuny i Marsal.) He is one of the notable artists of the Spanish school of the 19th century. He was not only an accomplished painter, but also a very good engraver and designer."
1766,"FOSCHI, Pierfrancesco di Jacopo","(b. 1502, Firenze, d. 1567, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/foschi/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist painter in Florence from the workshop of Andrea del Sarto. His later orientation was towards Sogliani (composition) and especially Pontormo.
"
1767,"FOSCHI, Francesco","(b. 1710, Ancona, d. 1780, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/foschi_f/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born into a family of the minor nobility, Foschi traveled and worked widely through the Papal States; particularly in his native Ancona, Loreto, Pesaro and Macerata. However, his arrival in Rome in 1729 was critical in his artistic formation: it put the young painter in touch with the most important cross-currents of the 'Grand Tour' culture. Vernet, Van Wittel, Manglard, Pannini and others were all developing differing approaches to the veduta. Foschi, surely aware of these artists' works, evolved his own, very specific genre to which he remained faithful throughout his long career."
1768,"FOUQUET, Jean","(b. ca. 1420, Tours, d. ca. 1480, Tours)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fouquet/biograph.html,"The outstanding French painter of the 15th century. He was born at Tours and is known to have been in Rome between 1443 and 1447, when he painted a portrait, now lost, of Pope Eugenius IV. Much has been made of this Italian journey, the influence of which can be detected in the perspective essays and Classical architecture of his subsequent works, but the strongly scrulptural character of his painting, which was deeply rooted in his native tradition, did not succumb to Italian influence.

"
1769,"FOUQUIER, Jacques","(b. 1590, Antwerpen, d. 1659, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fouquier/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in France. His first surviving painting is the Winter Landscape (1617; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum), a work in the manner of Jan Breughel the Elder, who may have been his master. However, a drawing of a River Scene (Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen), containing references to such Dutch landscape masters as Willem Buytewech and Esaias van de Velde, suggests that he may have trained in Holland. In 1614 he became a master in the artists' guild in Antwerp and in 1616 in that of Brussels. Soon afterwards he was in Heidelberg, working for Frederick V, the Elector Palatine."
1770,"FRACANZANO, Cesare","(b. ca. 1605, Bisceglie, d. 1651, Barletta)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fracanza/cesare/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Francesco Fracanzano. His style was formed in Apulia, and his earliest works, such as the Holy Family and the Education of the Virgin (San Gaetano, Barletta), were influenced by the Mannerist painters Gerolamo Imparato, Ippolito Borghese and Fabrizio Santafede. In 1622 he went to Naples, and c. 1630 he and his brother worked in the studio of Ribera. Such works as the St John the Baptist (early 1630s; Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples)) were influenced by the master's use of colour, though not by his harsh realism."
1771,"FRACANZANO, Francesco","(b. 1612, Monopoli, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fracanza/francesc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Cesare Francanzano. He moved to Naples in 1622 with Cesare and like him entered Ribera's workshop. In 1632 he married Salvator Rosa's sister Giovanna."
1772,"FRAGIACOMO, Pietro","(b. 1856, Pirano d'Istria, d. 1922, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fragiaco/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born at Pirano d'Istria near Trieste, Fragiacomo moved with his family to Venice, where he trained at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1878. Under the influence of Bresolin and Favretto, Fragiacomo devoted his talent to landscape painting from life, often in the company of his friend, the painter Giacomo Favretto. "
1773,"FRAGONARD, Jean-Honoré","(b. 1732, Grasse, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fragonar/father/biograph.html,"
French Rococo painter whose most familiar works, such as The Swing (c. 1766), are characterized by delicate hedonism."
1774,"FRAGONARD, Alexandre-Évariste","(b. 1780, Grasse, d. 1850, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fragonar/son/biograph.html,"
Painter, sculptor and draughtsman, son of Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Having been taught by his father and by David, he attracted notice at an early age and was considered the equal of Jean-Baptiste Isabey and of Hilaire Ledru in his drawings. He made his début at the Salon of 1793 with Timoleon Sacrificing his Brother (drawing; untraced); later he exhibited genre subjects similar to those of Jean-Baptiste Mallet, which were frequently reproduced in prints."
1775,"FRANCART, Jacques, the Younger","(b. ca. 1583, Antwerpen, d. 1651, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francart/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect, painter, and writer. Along with Wenceslas Cobergher and Pieter Huyssens, Francart was one of the most important church architects in the southern Netherlands in the early 17th century and he was a pioneering force in the introduction and dissemination of the Roman early Baroque style in this region. He was the son of the painter Jacques (Jacob) Francart the Elder (before 1550-1601) and the brother-in-law of Cobergher."
1776,"FRANCAVILLA, Pietro","(b. 1548, Cambrai, d. 1615, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francavi/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor (called also Pierre de Francqueville or Francheville). From a noble family, he learnt to draw in Paris in 1562–4. In 1565 he went to Innsbruck, presumably to assist Alexander Colyn on the great tomb in the Hofkirche for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and this is probably where he learnt sculpture. Archduke Ferdinand of Austria gave him a letter of introduction to Giambologna c. 1570, and he went to Florence, where he was sufficiently skilled at carving to become a partner of Giambologna, not merely an assistant."
1777,"FRANCÉS, Nicolás",(active 1424-1468 in León),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frances/biograph.html,"
In León, the International Gothic style was first introduced by a painter of great refinement, whose French origin is reflected in his name, Nicolás Francés. He was already living in León during the episcopate of Alfonso de Cusanza (1424-1437). In the Cathedral records he is described as an artist in stained glass, though he is also the author of the great retable, executed in 1434. Francés painted extensively and well. His work includes the mural decorations in the cloister and two compositions in the ambulatory of León cathedral, together with various paintings on wood. His style appears to derive from that of the Paris school of the first quarter of the fifteenth century. In particular, he possesses the same same subtlety of tone, the same grace in arranging the elements of his composition against a landscape background, and the same neatness of detail, but above all the same harmony of color. Until his death in 1468, he was for thirty years the foremost painter of the school of León.



"
1778,"FRANCESCHI, Jules","(b. 1825, Bar-sur-Aube, d. 1893, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frances1/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was born at Bar-sur-Aube in 1825, his parents were Italian. His teacher was Rude. He won his first medals at the Salons of 1848 and 1849, and was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1874. He produced a great number of busts of celebrated persons, Sardou, Massé, Gounod, Augier, and Croizette being the subjects of his best work  in that form."
1779,"FRANCESCHINI, Baldassarre","(b. 1611, Volterra, d. 1690, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frances2/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman (known as Il Volterrano). He was the son of Guasparri Franceschini, a sculptor in alabaster, and studied first with the local artist Cosimo Daddi (d 1630) then, from 1628, in Florence with Matteo Rosselli. His first works, which are still in Volterra, are the Purification of the Virgin (1630; Volterra, S Agostino), Elijah and the Angel (1631; Volterra, S Giusto Abbey Church) and the Assumption of the Virgin (1631; Volterra, Archv Capitolare); they reveal the influence of Rosselli and elements of Mannerism."
1780,"FRANCESCHINI, Marcantonio","(b. 1648, Bologna, d. 1729, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frances3/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was a leading master of his time. He painted altarpieces and cabinet pictures and was exceptionally skilled at large-scale fresco decoration, in which capacity he was widely active. He was the pupil of Carlo Cignani, himself the most distinguished pupil of Francesco Albani, and thus traced his artistic lineage directly back to Bolognese classicism. He interpreted the principles fundamental to this style with a rigour unequalled by any contemporary Italian master, being rivalled in this only by such French classicists as Eustache Le Sueur. Many artists were trained in his studio in Bologna and at his summer villa at Belpoggio. His closest follower was Giacinto Garofalini (1661-1723). Pupils of greater distinction included Giacomo Antonio Boni and Giuseppe Marchesi.



"
1781,FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI,"(b. 1439, Siena, d. 1502, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francesc/biograph.html,"Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Sienese painter, sculptor, architect and engineer, belongs to a select group of Renaissance practitioners, including Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Peruzzi, and, of course, Leonardo da Vinci, who excelled in several of the arts at the same time. A native of Siena, he may have been trained by Vecchietta (1410-1480), both a successful painter and sculptor. Francesco di Giorgio's early career, however, is too poorly documented to make any definitive judgments.

1782,FRANCESCO D'ANTONIO,"(b. ca. 1393, Firenze, d. after 1433, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/01/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a minor Florentine master whose work follows the shift in Florentine painting from the style of Lorenzo Monaco through that of Gentile da Fabriano, Masaccio and Masolino in the 1420s to that of Fra Angelico at the beginning of the 1430s. His artistic personality was differentiated by Longhi from that of an artist now identified as Masaccio's brother Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, called Scheggia."
1783,FRANCESCO DA MILANO,(active 1377-1388),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/011/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith, active in Dalmatia). According to an extant cntract, between 1377 and 1388 the jeweler Francesco da Milano prepared the silver mask of St Simeon originally intended for the church of the Virgin in Zára (since 1632 St Simeon, Zadar). He also executed the silver gilt reliquary shrine of St Simeon in the same church.



"
1784,FRANCESCO DA RIMINI,(active 1320-1348 in Rimini),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/012/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was recorded in Rimini in 133 and had died there in 1348. His only surviving, but undated, works are the now detached frescoes (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna) once in the refectory of San Francesco, Bologna, which are heavily dependent on the Franciscan scenes in the Upper Church of San Francesco, Assisi. Recent dating of the Bolognese frescoes placed them in the early 1320s."
1785,FRANCESCO DA SANT'AGATA,(active 1491-1528 in Padua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/02/biograph.html,"
Francesco di Giacomo da Sant'Agata, Italian goldsmith and sculptor. Documents dating from between 1491 and 1528 record his activity as a goldsmith in the area near the church of Sant'Agata in Padua, from which he derives his name. His one securely documented work to survive, a boxwood Hercules with a Club (Wallace Collection, London), signed OPVS. FRANCISCI. AVRIFICIS, was highly praised in 1560 by Bernardino Scardeone, who stated that it was in the collection of Marc'Antonio Massimo in Padua. This sleek and highly finished statuette of a muscular Hercules wielding his club established the standard against which a number of similar boxwood and bronze figures have been compared. The analogies between the work's posture and modelling and those of another statuette of Hercules (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) prompted some critics to ascribe this to da Sant'Agata as well, although it has been reattributed to Vittore Gambello."
1786,FRANCESCO DAL PRATO,"(b. 1512, Caravaggio, d. 1562, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/03/biograph.html,"
Francesco di Girolamo Ortensi, medallist, painter, sculptor, goldsmith and armourer, known as Francesco del Prato because his workshop faced the prato (meadow) of the Ognissanti in Florence. According to Vasari, he was a fine draftsman and had also learned to paint. Vasari described him as the best goldsmith of his time and mentioned that he had made a fine medal of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence (untraced), which was placed in the foundations of the gate at Faenza, and another, a struck piece, of Pope Clement VII (1529-30; Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence) with a reverse of Christ bound to a column for the flagellation, commemorating the Pope's imprisonment during the Sack of Rome (1527). He collaborated with Baccio Bandinelli, with whom he traveled to Charles V's coronation by Clement VII in Bologna in 1530 in order to obtain papal and Medici commissions."
1787,FRANCESCO DE' FRANCESCHI,(active 1443-1468 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/04/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His most important known work is the 12-part polyptych of St Peter (1447; Padua, Museo Civico), formerly in S Pietro, Padua. The largest panel, St Peter Enthroned, shows the saint in full papal regalia. In smaller flanking panels are standing figures of St Christopher, St Paul and St John the Baptist, as well as the Archangel Michael, depicted trampling the demon. In yet smaller panels, perhaps originally placed above, are half-length figures of St Francis, St Mary Magdalene, St Clare (?Scholastica) and St Prosdocimo (?Benedict). The top panel, a Crucifixion, is flanked by the two narrowest panels, both of an Angel Praying. The polyptych was long attributed to Antonio Vivarini and Bartolomeo Vivarini, or Michele Giambono, but in 1904 Moschetti proved that it was painted by Francesco, whose name once appeared on its frame.

1789,FRANCESCO DI ANTONIO DEL CHIERICO,"(b. 1433, d. 1484, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/05/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and goldsmith. The creator of some of the liveliest miniatures of the 15th century, his manuscripts are rich in stylistic innovation and thematic invention, sometimes elaborated in a very limited space. He worked for the most important patrons in Italy and abroad, beginning his artistic career under Cosimo il Vecchio and Piero I de' Medici, and continuing it under Lorenzo the Magnificent. Vespasiano da Bisticci was his contact with patrons outside Florence, who included Federigo II da Montefeltro, Ferdinand I, King of Naples, Louis XI of France and Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary."
1790,FRANCESCO DI GABRIELE DA VITERBO,(active around 1500 in Viterbo),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/06/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Viterbo at the turn of the 15th century. It is assumed that he was the grandson of Francesco d'Antonio Zacchi, called Balletta (active by 1430-died before 1476) and the son of Gabriele di Francesco. Balletta was a rather significant artist in Viterbo and a number of panels and polyptychs by him have survived in and around the city. His son Gabriele di Francesco was less prolific but a small number of works are securely attributable to him."
1791,FRANCESCO DI SIMONE DA SANTACROCE,"(b. ca. 1440, Santacroce, d. 1508, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/07/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A group of painters known as 'the painters of Santa Croce' emerged at the beginning of the 16th century in Venice. Though not all members of a single family, they all came from Santa Croce, a hamlet on the hills beyond the river Brembo, before emigrating to Venice. The painters can generally be grouped into two factions and they appear to have set up in Venice under two different workshops: the first was headed by Francesco di Simone and the other by Girolamo (active 1503-1556)."
1792,FRANCESCO DI VANNUCCIO,(active 1356-89 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franceso/08/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Siena. Little is known about his life. His single documented work is an altarpiece in Berlin signed FRANCISCHUS DE VANNUCIO DE SENIS PINSIT HOC OPUS MCCCLXXX. It is a double-sided panel of The Virgin and Child with Saints and a Crucifixion with Saints. His style is largely derived from the most important Sienese artist of the second quarter of the century, Simone Martini."
1793,"FRANCHI, Antonio","(b. 1638, Villa Basilica, d. 1709, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franchi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and theorist, called Il Lucchese. After training in Lucca with Domenico Ferrucci, he settled for 12 years (1655-67) in Florence, where he studied with Felice Ficherelli and Baldassare Franceschini (called il Volterrano). His style unites classical and Baroque elements and reflects his study of the art of Reni, Cortona and Rubens."
1794,"FRANCHOYS, Lucas the Elder","(b. 1574, Mechelen, d. 1643, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franchoy/lucas1/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, born in a family of artists. His sister Cornelia married the sculptor Hendrik Faydherbe and their son Lucas Faydherbe became a leading Flemish Baroque sculptor. Lucas Franchoys the Elder became a master in the Mechelen Guild of St. Luke in 1599. Between 1613 and 1640 he was deacon of the guild six times."
1795,"FRANCHOYS, Lucas the Younger","(b. 1616, Mechelen, d. 1681, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franchoy/lucas2/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Lucas Franchoys the Elder, younger brother of Pieter Franchoys, and cousin of Lucas Faydherbe. He had his first training with his father in Mechelen, but the style of his work suggests that he may have had contact with artistic circles in Antwerp. He is first mentioned as a painter in 1649, in connection with work he carried out for churches in Tournai, where he lived for some time. By 1654 at the latest he was back in Mechelen, and for the rest of his life he executed a wealth of religious compositions for the town's churches and monasteries."
1796,"FRANCHOYS, Pieter","(b. 1606, Mechelen, d. 1654, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franchoy/pieter/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of artists in Mechelen. Lucas Franchoys the Elder was a portrait and figure painter. He was dean of the Guild of St Luke six times between 1603 and 1640. He probably trained both his sons, Pieter Franchoys and Lucas Franchoys the Younger."
1797,"FRANCIA, Francesco","(b. 1450, Bologna, d. 1517, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francia/biograph.html,"
Francia (Francesco Raibolini), the outstanding Bolognese painter of his period, originally a goldsmith. He entered into a partnership with Lorenzo Costa after the latter came to Bologna c.1483 and was later influenced also by Perugino.. His most characteristic works are sweet, softly rounded Madonnas, which his large workshop produced in some numbers. He was also an accomplished portraitist. There are several examples of his work in the National Gallery, London."
1798,FRANCIABIGIO,"(b. ca. 1482, Firenze, d. 1525, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franciab/biograph.html,"
Franciabigio (Francesco di Cristofano) was a Florentine painter, a minor master of the High Renaissance style. He was a pupil of Marinotto Albertinelli and collaborated with Andrea del Sarto (on the frescoes in the Annunziata church in Florence), who was the dominant influence on his style, as may be seen in his frescoes of this Convent. His best works are generally considered to be his portraits.


"
1799,"FRANCKEN, Ambrosius","(b. ca. 1544, Antwerpen, d. 1618, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/ambrosiu/biograph.html,"
Francken, family of Flemish painters active during five generations in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in Antwerp. The individual contributions of the many artists in the family are often difficult to assess, but the two most distinguished members were Frans I and his son Frans II (1581-1642). From the second generation Hieronymus I and Ambrosius I can be mentioned who adopted Marten de Vos's Mannerism of Venetian origin.

"
1800,"FRANCKEN, Frans I","(b. 1542, Herentals, d. 1616, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/frans1/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, brother of Hieronymus Francken I. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1567 and a deacon in 1587. Together with Marten de Vos and Frans Floris, Frans I and his brother Ambrosius I were the most important painters in Catholic Antwerp during the Counter-Reformation. After the Iconoclastic Fury, the brothers received a number of ecclesiastical commissions to replace works destroyed in the churches in and around the city (e.g. for the St Waltrudiskerk, Herentals, and the St Maartenskerk, Aalst). Huge altarpieces, such as the Last Judgement for Herentals, with the figures ranged in rows as in a frieze, with very little depth or breadth, illustrate Frans I's hieroglyphic style. His earliest surviving works are two panels of a triptych of the Last Supper (1581) painted for the high altar of the cathedral of St Bavo in Ghent. His masterpiece, a triptych of Christ among the Scribes for Antwerp Cathedral (1587), remains in situ: its figures with their reticent gestures are rather wooden in effect, but the heads indicate the artist's skill for portraiture."
1801,"FRANCKEN, Frans II","(b. 1581, Antwerpen, d. 1642, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/frans2/biograph.html,"
Francken, family of Flemish painters active during five generations in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in Antwerp, although several of them were also active in France. The individual contributions of the many artists in the family are often difficult to assess, but the two most distinguished members were Frans I and his son Frans II. From the second generation Hieronymus I and Ambrosius I can be mentioned who adopted Marteen de Vos's Mannerism of Venetian origin. The sons of Frans Francken II followed in their father's footsteps, but were weaker artists: Frans Francken III, the best of the youngest generation; Hieronymus Francken III, who specialized in religious subjects; and Ambrosius Francken III c. 1614;-1662).

"
1802,"FRANCKEN, Frans III","(b. 1607, Antwerpen, d. 1667, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/frans3/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of the Francken family, son of Frans Francken II. He was elected a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke only in 1639 and became a deacon in 1656-57. Like his father, he signed his pictures with the abbreviation den jon, so that style is the only basis for distinguishing between the two artists. Frans III was said to have been given the nickname 'Rubens-Francken' by his contemporaries, although the oldest record of this nickname is 1883 (Van den Branden). However, it is quite inappropriate as Frans III was merely an inferior imitator of Frans II. Even though his work must be assessed mainly on the basis of the staffage figures he painted for the church interiors of Pieter Neeffs I, the nickname is misleading as any influence of Rubens is undetectable. The signed Scene with Company (Salzburg, Residenzgalerie) shows compositional borrowings from his father and elements of Dutch genre painting; the figures, however, are less skilful and solid than those of his father and more coarsely executed."
1803,"FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, I","(b. ca. 1540, Herentals, d. 1610, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/hierony1/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. It is uncertain, after his training in Antwerp, whether he went to Italy, as seems to be suggested by his Venetian Carnival (1565; Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum, Aachen), a remarkable picture with a graceful company of dancers portrayed against the scenery props of the commedia dell'arte. Such a subject would be quite exceptional for Antwerp at such an early date, lending further support to the idea that he spent some time in Italy in the mid-1560s. There is no question, however, that from 1566 to 1572 he was in France. In 1568 Cornelis Floris, the Antwerp master builder, sent his son to Paris to serve his apprenticeship with Hieronymus I, who was back in Antwerp again for a short period in 1574."
1804,"FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, II","(b. 1578, Antwerpen, d. 1623, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/hierony2/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Frans Francken I. He probably trained with his father and in 1605 was apprenticed to his uncle, Ambrosius I. Hieronymus II became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1607 and was apparently in Paris in 1609. The similarity of style in the figures in the groups of dancers by Frans II and Hieronymus II may possibly be explained by their both having spent some time training in Paris with Hieronymus I, who had already earlier produced variations on this theme. Hieronymus II's signed painting of Jan Snellinckx's Studio (1621; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) is the starting-point for other ascriptions to him of such pictures of art galleries as the Art Gallery with the Archdukes Albert and Isabella (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore). The staffage in these interiors is sometimes by as yet unidentified figure painters."
1805,"FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, III","(b. 1611, Antwerpen, d. after 1661)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francken/hierony3/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, member of the youngest generation of the Francken family of painters. He was the son of Frans Francken II, and the brother of Frans Francken III and Ambrosius Francken III. He specialized in religious subjects.



"
1806,"FRANCO, Battista","(b. ca. 1510, Venezia, d. 1561, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franco/battista/biograph.html,"
Battista Franco (also Baptista Veneziano or Il Semolei) was an Italian painter, engraver and draughtsman. Giorgio Vasari, who knew Franco well and who is the chief source for his life, claimed that Franco was born in 1498; however, later writers placed his birth in 1510, and the latter date seems more likely."
1807,"FRANCO, Giacomo","(b. 1550, Venezia, d. 1620, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franco/giacomo/biograph.html,"
Italian draftsman, engraver, and publisher. Very little is known about his life. The son of painter Battista Franco, with whom he began his artistic training at the age of eleven, he worked as a painter, engraver, woodcutter, and dealer in graphics and books. For a while he studied in Bologna with Agostino Carracci. Possibly as a result of his study with Agostino Carracci, Franco published a collection of his own ""facsimile font"" figure studies in 1596, in which one or two human figures are positioned to form each of the letters of the alphabet."
1808,"FRANÇOIS, Guy","(b. 1578/79, Le Puy, d. 1650, Le Puy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/francois/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was known to be in Rome as early as 1608 and to be back in his native Puy-de-Dôme by 1613. He seems to have spent the rest of his long career in and around Le Puy, with an undocumented visit to Toulouse at an indeterminate date, probably in the 1620s. Most of the artist's pictures remain in the obscurity of the parish churches for which they were painted, and it is clear that he had ceased to experiment by about 1630. One of his most important pictures is at Bourg-en-Brese, the large altarpiece The Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth of 1626, which shows the artist's careful assimilation of the style of the Roman painter Carlo Saraceni.
"
1809,"FRANGIPANE, Niccolò",(active 1563-1585),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frangipa/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Little documentary evidence survives concerning the life of Niccolò Frangipane, who is recorded as working in Venice and the Marches during the second half of the 16th century. His oeuvre consists principally of three types of painting: religious works, many of which draw heavily from Titian's production of the 1540s and 1550s; arcadian figures, in the style of Giorgione; and light-hearted mythological or genre scenes, reminiscent of the work of Vincenzo Campi.


"
1810,"FRANQUE, Jean-Pierre","(b. 1774, Le Buis, d. 1860, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/franque/biograph.html,"
French painter. He and his twin brother, Joseph-Boniface Franque (1774-1833), who was also a painter, were the sons of a modest farmer and, according to a local story, their youthful talent was such that the provincial government paid for them to study in Grenoble. They enrolled at the Ecole Gratuite in Grenoble and stayed for about two years (1786-88), training to become engravers. During the revolutionary period, the twins' education was taken over by the Département de la Drôme. In 1792 their case was discussed at the National Assembly in Paris, which placed them in David's atelier and provided a pension for four years. David agreed to educate them but refused payment, writing to the President of the Assembly, 'I am overjoyed to be chosen to be the first teacher of these youths who could be called children of the nation since they owe everything to her.' The two brothers were considered very promising students, and David asked Jean-Pierre to assist him in the execution of the Intervention of the Sabine Women (1796-99; Paris, Louvre)."
1811,"FRATELLINI, Giovanna","(b. 1666, Firenze, d. 1731, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fratelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (née Marmocchini Cortesi). After training with Livio Mehus and Pietro Dandini she was appointed lady-in-waiting to Vittoria della Rovere, dowager Grand Duchess of Tuscany, who had her instructed in painting and music. She studied painting in miniature with Ippolito Galantini (1627-1706) and in pastel with Domenico Tempesti (c. 1655-1737). She also learnt to paint in enamel and she finished her studies with Anton Domenico Gabbiani. Grand Duke Cosimo III, Grand Prince Ferdinando and his consort Violante Beatrice of Bavaria and numerous other members of the nobility commissioned portraits from her. The oval-shaped miniature enamel Portrait of a Young Man (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore) perhaps depicts Cosimo III's son Gian Gastone de' Medici. Fratellini married in 1684, and her unidealized Self-portrait (Uffizi, Florence) shows her painting a portrait of her son Lorenzo. She also painted fables, bacchanals and historical subjects, such as the Death of Lucretia (untraced). The painter Violante Beatrice Siries (1709-83) was her pupil.



"
1812,"FRATIN, Christophe","(b. 1801, Metz, d. 1864, Le Raincy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fratin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, the son of a taxidermist. He first studied sculpture under Charles Augustin Pioche (1762-1839) in Metz but became disillusioned with the romantic style of the day and moved to Paris where he studied under the painter and sculptor Géricault."
1813,"FREDIANI, Vincenzo di Antonio",(active 1481-1505 in Lucca),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frediani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, formerly known as the Master of the Lucchese Immaculate Conception. The discovery of the contract for a large painting which was originally his name-piece, the Immaculate Conception with Saints and Kings David and Solomon, for the church of San Francesco in Lucca, has identified Frediani as the painter of a group of paintings formerly attributed to the Master of the Immaculate Conception."
1814,"FREI, Sisto",(active 1500-1515 in Italy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frei/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, son of Enrico Frei from Nuremberg. He became citizen in Nuremberg and lived in Trento from 1511. His known works are the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in the Cappella Colleoni, Bergamo, and a Crucifix with figures in Trento Cathedral.



"
1815,"FRÉMIET, Emmanuel","(b. 1824, Paris, d. 1910, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fremiet/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and stage designer. He was a nephew and pupil of François Rude and chiefly devoted himself to animal sculpture and to equestrian statues in armour. Next to Antoine Louis Barye, Frémiet is considered to be the finest and best known of the French 'Animalier' sculptors and responsible for bringing animal sculpture into fashion. His equestrian statue of Joan of Arc (Place des Pyramides, Paris) is a familiar landmark."
1816,"FRÉMIN, René","(b. 1672, Paris, d. 1744, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fremin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. A pupil of François Girardon and Antoine Coysevox, he won the Prix de Rome in 1694 and spent the years 1695-99 in Rome, where he contributed two elegant Baroque bronze bas-reliefs, from drawings by Andrea Pozzo, to the sculptural ensemble of the altar of S Ignazio in Il Gesu (in situ). On his return to France he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1700 and received (reçu) as an academician the following year on presentation of the bas-relief Time Unveiling Truth (marble; frags, Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts). At the Salon of 1704 he exhibited an ambitious stone group of Hercules Abducting Deianera (Chantilly, Château, park), which recalls the great groups of Giambologna and Gianlorenzo Bernini as well as the sculpture of Versailles."
1817,"FRÉMINET, Martin","(b. 1567, Paris, d. 1619, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/freminet/biograph.html,"
French painter. He first studied with his father, Médéric Fréminet (active 1550-1600), who is thought to have taught also Toussaint Dubreuil. Martin Fréminet painted a St Sebastian (untraced) for the church of St Josse in Paris before leaving for Italy around 1587. In Rome he became a friend of the Cavaliere d'Arpino, took an interest in the painting of Caravaggio and, above all, studied the work of Michelangelo. A number of untraced paintings that he executed in Rome were recorded in the form of engravings by Philippe Thomassin and published between 1589 and 1592."
1818,"FREUND, Hermann Ernst","(b. 1786, Germany, d. 1840, Kopenhagen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/freund/biograph.html,"
Danish sculptor, born in Germany. In 1803 he was sent to Copenhagen as an apprentice to his uncle, who was a smith. After his apprenticeship he was educated as a sculptor at the Art Academy, and in 1817 he could head for Rome having received the academy's highest accolade - its gold medal."
1819,"FREY, Johannes Jakob","(b. 1813, Basel, d. 1865, Frascati)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frey/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter. He was taught first by his father, the painter and lithographer Samuel Frey (1785-1836). He studied in Paris in the early 1830s, and then in Munich (1834); thanks to the sponsorship of Emilie Lindner, a patron of the arts, he was able to move on to Rome where he specialized in landscape painting (Mountains in the Roman Campagna, Kunstmuseum, Basel)"
1820,"FRIEDRICH, Caspar David","(b. 1774, Greifswald, d. 1840, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/friedric/biograph.html,"
The greatest German Romantic painter and one of the most original geniuses in the history of landscape painting. He was born at Greifswald on the Baltic coast, and after studying at the Copenhagen Academy with Juel and Abildgaard from 1794 to 1798, he settled permanently in Dresden. There he led a quiet life, interrupted only by occasional excursions to the mountains or the coast of Pomerania, pursuing with a rare and instinctive single-mindedness his personal insight into the spiritual significance of landscape. He was intensely introspective and often melancholic (although his marriage at the age of 44 brought him much happiness), and he relied on deep contemplation to summon up mentally the images he was to put on canvas. 'Close your bodily eye, so that you may see your picture first with your spiritual eye', he wrote, 'then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react on others from the outside inwards.'"
1821,"FRIES, Ernst","(b. 1801, Heidelberg, d. 1833, Karlsruhe)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fries/biograph.html,"
Draughtsman, painter and lithographer, part of a German family of artists: three sons of a prosperous banker and manufacturer in Heidelberg all worked in that city for part of their careers, as well as in Munich, Karlsruhe, Düsseldorf, Geneva and Rome. Wilhelm Fries (1819-1878) lived in the area of Lake Constance for most of his life and painted landscapes of that region, the Bavarian Alps and northern Italy; the youngest son, Bernhard Fries (1820-1879), was also a landscape painter."

American Impressionist painter who spent most of his life as an expatriate in France. An influential member of the Giverny art colony, his paintings often concentrated on various effects of dappled sunlight."
1823,"FRIESS, Joachim","(b. ca 1579, Lübeck, d. 1620, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/friess/biograph.html,"
German goldsmith, active in Augsburg. Renaissance Augsburg was, after Nuremberg, the greatest of the German manufacturing and commercial cities, and a ready supply of silver enabled its guild of goldsmiths to fashion great numbers of richly ornamented vessels for export. Joachim Friess became master goldsmith in Augsburg in 1610. Other biographical data are not available about him.

Italian architect. Born to a noble family in Padua, he had the title of count. From 1691 to 1720 he was curator of the public library in his hometown. Later, due to family disputes, he settled in Modena. He was very active both as an architect, designing buildings and churches in Padua, Vicenza, Stra and Modena, and as librettist of operas for the Teatro San Giovanni Crisostomo in Venice and the Teatro Obizzi in Padua."

Dutch painter. In his youth, he produced works for the art dealer Gerrit van Uylenburgh in Amsterdam. From 1658 he was active in The Hague. In 1670 he was appointed as conservator of the royal collection in Potsdam. In 1671, when Van Uylenburgh tried to sell 13 paintings to Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, Fromantiou successfully advised the Elector to send 12 pieces back as forgeries. Fromantiou claimed the paintings were copies of Italian ones, and he could point out the originals in Holland."

English painter, a follower of William Etty, and like him, was one of the few painters in England to dedicate himself to the nude. He was encouraged by his parents to take up painting after showing an early talent for art.

He remained in Moscow after the death of Pietro Antonio Solari in 1493 and the departure of Aloisio da Carcano for Poland some ten years later. This group built the Ivan the Great Bell Tower which can be related to late-fifteenth-century Lombard campaniles.



"
1834,"FRYTOM, Frederik van","(b. ca. 1630, ?, d. 1702, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/frytom/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. It is not known where and precisely when he was born, but he married in Delft in 1652, which would put his age around 20. He never joined the Guild of St Luke, to which all the owners of the Delft faience factories belonged along with many of their employees, and probably worked independently for different faience producers. He occupied the post of 'guild servant' for a few years towards the end of his life. A group of plates, dishes and plaques have been attributed to him on the basis of his distinctive technique and 'handwriting'."
1835,"FUGA, Ferdinando","(b. 1699, Firenze, d. ca. 1782, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fuga/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. Before 1717, he studied under the sculptor and architect Giovan Battista Foggini in Florence. From 1717 to 1726, Fuga studied architecture in Rome. In 1726, he was called to Naples to work for Cardinal Nicola del Giudici. In 1728, he entered the service of the King of Naples. In 1730, Fuga returned to Rome and served as papal architect during the pontificate of Clement XII and Benedict XIV. In 1751, he returned to Naples to work for King Charles III of Naples as one of the court architects in renovations to the city of Naples."
1836,"FÜGER, Friedrich Heinrich","(b. 1751, Heilbronn, d. 1818, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fuger/biograph.html,"
German painter. At the age of eight he was already painting miniature portraits. In 1764 he entered the Hohe Karlsschule in Stuttgart and received drawing lessons from Nicolas Guibal. Overawed by the great historical paintings in the ducal gallery, he lost heart and moved to Halle to study law; but in 1771 public demand for his miniatures encouraged him to return to painting, and in that year he moved to Leipzig, to the school of Adam Friedrich Oeser, where he became acquainted with Classical art."
1837,"FÜHRICH, Joseph von","(b. 1800, Kratzau, d. 1876, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fuhrich/biograph.html,"
Bohemian painter, printmaker and teacher. Until he was 18 he was trained by his father, Wenzel Führich, a painter and mason. In 1819, at the academy exhibition in Prague, he made his début with two history paintings. Their success enabled him to study in Prague. Dürer was the first powerful influence on his style; on a visit to Vienna in 1822, medieval and Renaissance art made a similar impression. His illustrations for Ludwig Tieck's Leben und Tod der heiligen Genoveva (1824-05) attracted the interest of Prince Metternich, who helped him obtain a scholarship to study in Italy."
1838,"FUMIANI, Giovanni Antonio","(b. ca. 1645, Venezia, d. 1710, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fumiani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained in Bologna under Domenico degli Ambrogi, a specialist in architectural perspective, but by 1668 he was in Venice, where he painted a Virgin and Saints, characterized by a monumentality reminiscent of the Carracci, in S Benedetto. He was influenced by Bolognese artists, particularly Ludovico Carracci and Alessandro Tiarini, and soon also became interested in the work of Veronese, so that he started to use elaborate architectural settings and brighter colours. This is apparent in the Virgin Appearing to Pius V (1674; Vicenza, S Lorenzo), whose monumentality foreshadows Tiepolo, whereas mosaics in S Marco, created in 1677 from Fumiani's cartoons, are closer to the idiosyncratic art of Pietro della Vecchia."
1839,"FUNGAI, Bernardino","(b. 1460, Siena, d. 1516, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fungai/biograph.html,"
Fungai, Bernardino Cristofano di Nicholo d'Antonio di Pietro, Italian painter. Scholars find little documentation of his career. Only in this century has academic attention turned to him. He is recorded in 1482 as Benvenuto di Giovanni's garzone at work on the monochrome frescoes decorating the drum of the cupola of Siena Cathedral. Most scholars have accepted Benvenuto as Fungai's teacher but stress the greater influence of Matteo di Giovanni; other proposals have included Giovanni di Paolo and, following the reattribution of paintings traditionally ascribed to Giacomo Pacchiarotti, Pietro Orioli."
1840,"FUNK, Hans","(b. ca. 1470, Zürich, d. ca. 1539, Zürich)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/funk/biograph.html,"
Swiss stained-glass painter. He was mentioned before 1489 in court records in Zurich, where relatives were also active as stained-glass artists at the beginning of the 16th century. He settled c. 1499-1500 in Bern, living from 1509 in the Kirchgasse (now Münstergasse), and in 1519 he was appointed a member of the cantonal parliament (Grosser Rat). He received many commissions throughout the Swiss Confederation, above all in Bern and Fribourg, and his work exercised a significant influence on the other stained-glass artists of Berne."

Lukas Furtenagel was a German painter, part of a family of artists active in Augsburg in the sixteenth century. He worked in the circle of Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg and Halle between 1542 and 1546. Among the rare paintings attributed to him the most famous is the Portrait of Hans Burgkmair and his Wife Anna before a Mirror (1529, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna).



"
1843,"FUSELI, John Henry","(b. 1741, Zürich, d. 1825, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/f/fuseli/biograph.html,"
Swiss-born painter (Johann Heinrich Füssli), draughtsman, and writer on art, active mainly in England, where he was one of the outstanding figures of the Romantic movement. He was the son of a portrait painter, Johann Caspar Füssli (1707-1782), but he originally trained as a priest; he took holy orders in 1761, but never practised."

Jan Fyt (also spelt Fijt), Flemish painter and etcher, primarily of still-life and hunting pieces. He was mainly active in his native Antwerp, where he was a pupil of Snyders, but in the course of his successful and prolific career he also travelled in France, the Netherlands, and Italy."
1845,"GABBIANI, Anton Domenico","(b. 1652, Firenze, d. 1726, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gabbiani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He first trained with the Medici court portrait painter Justus Sustermans and then with the painter Vincenzo Dandini. On 20 May 1673 he arrived in Rome, where he studied for three years under Ciro Ferri and Ercole Ferrata at the Accademia Fiorentina. He responded in particular to the paintings of Pietro da Cortona and Carlo Maratti who were both to be important influences on him. Though not precocious, Gabbiani became one of the most noted painters from the Accademia."
1846,"GABRI, Pietro","(d. 1585, Brno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gabri/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Moravia. He came to Brno with his entire family (mother Ursula, wife Anna, siblings Antonio and Ursula) around 1570. Shortly after his arrival he was accepted as a burgher and mason. His first construction works were minor orders. In 1577, the city council signed a contract with him concerning the Town Hall Tower. He completed its Renaissance appearance, raised it by 5 meters, topped it with a gallery and high-pitched turrets."
1847,"GABRIEL, Ange-Jacques","(b. 1698, Paris, d. 1782, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gabriel/biograph.html,"
Architect, part of a French family of architects. Jacques I Gabriel was sufficiently prominent before the end of the first decade of the 17th century to be called upon to provide Rouen with a Hôtel de Ville. His sons Maurice I Gabriel 1602-1649) and Jacques II Gabriel (b. 1605) practiced architecture in Normandy and Touraine respectively. Maurice's sons Jacques III Gabriel (1637-1697) and Maurice II Gabriel (1639-1693), active in Paris, where they were eclipsed in importance by Jacques II's son Jacques IV Gabriel.

1848,"GADDI, Agnolo","(b. ca. 1350, Firenze, d. 1390, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaddi/agnolo/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter, the son of Taddeo Gaddi. He continued the Giotto tradition but modified it still further in the direction of decorative elegance. He is particularly notable for his cool pale colours, which infiuenced the refined late Gothic art of artists of the next generation such as Lorenzo Monaco. Agnolo's works include frescos on The Story of the Cross in the chancel of Sta Croce (after 1374) and on The Story of the Virgin and her Girdle in the Chapel of the Holy Girdle in Prato Cathedral (1392-5). Many panel paintings also are attributed to Agnolo.



"
1849,"GADDI, Gaddo","(b. ca. 1260, Firenze, d. ca. 1333, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaddi/gaddo/biograph.html,"
Gaddo di Zanobi Gaddi, Italian painter and mosaicist, the father of Taddeo Gaddi. He is recorded in the rolls of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali and written about by Giorgio Vasari, a 16th-century biographer of artists, but his oeuvre is largely conjectural. Vasari said that he was associated with Cimabue and Giotto. He completed mosaics on façade of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The Coronation of the Virgin mosaic over the inside door of Florence Cathedral, dated 1307, is also attributed to Gaddo Gaddi.

Antonello Gagini (also spelled Gaggini; Gazini; Gazzini), Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, masons and architects. One branch of the family, which came from Bissone, Ticino, was active in Genoa from the 15th century. The Gagini workshop was organized along medieval lines: they produced works in collaboration, combining the skills of mason and sculptor. Their work was chiefly of a decorative and ornamental nature, figurative sculpture being of secondary importance. They remained active in Genoa until the 19th century.

1853,"GAGLIARDI, Rosario","(b. ca. 1682, Siracusa, d. 1762, Noto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gagliar/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He was one of the leading architects working in the Sicilian Baroque. In spite of never leaving Sicily, his work showed great understanding of the style. His architectural activity began in 1702 with the cathedral at Modica."
1854,"GAGLIARDO, Primario","(died 1348, Naples)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gagliard/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, active in Naples. Originating from a family of builders, he began his work by assisting Father Riccardo, who was working on the construction of a hospital near Lake Lucrino, in the village of Tripergole, later destroyed by the eruption of Monte Nuovo, the most recent volcano in Pozzuoli area. In 1306 Gagliardo worked for the construction of a thermal hospice for the poor, erected by the will of Charles II in the area between Pozzuoli and Arco Felice."
1855,"GAGNERAUX, Bénigne","(b. 1756, Dijon, d. 1795, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gagnerau/biograph.html,"
French painter and engraver. He was one of the most important artists to emerge from François Devosge's school of art in Dijon. His reputation, like that of his fellow Dijonnais artist Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, is based on a number of Neo-classical works of a pleasingly poetic character, which Devosge had encouraged. In 1776 he became the first artist from the Dijon art school to win the Prix de Rome with his painting of an uplifting moral subject, Manius Curius Dentatus Refusing the Presents of the Samnites (Nancy, Musée des Beaux-Arts). The Dijon academy was very quickly recognized as one of the most important outside Paris. As a student there Gagneraux was directed towards examples from antiquity, the Italian Renaissance and the work of Poussin."
1856,"GAI, Antonio","(b. 1686, Venezia, d. 1769, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gai/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His father, Francesco, was a wood-carver, and Gai qualified as a master wood-carver in 1710. The geometric precision and subtle rhythm of his later work remained indebted to this early training. In 1733 he undertook the execution of the portal of the Loggetta in Venice; this was an important public commission and demonstrates his high local standing, which was confirmed in 1764 when he was elected president of the Venetian Accademia."
1857,"GAINSBOROUGH, Thomas","(b. 1727, Sudbury, d. 1788, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gainsbor/biograph.html,"
English portrait and landscape painter, the most versatile English painter of the 18th century. Some of his early portraits show the sitters grouped in a landscape (Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, c. 1750). As he became famous and his sitters fashionable, he adopted a more formal manner that owed something to Anthony Van Dyck (The Blue Boy, c. 1770). His landscapes are of idyllic scenes. During his last years he also painted seascapes and idealized full-size pictures of rustics and country children.
"
1858,"GAL'BERG, Samuil Ivanovich","(b. 1787, Kattentak, d. 1839, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galberg/biograph.html,"
Estonian sculptor, active in Russia. He studied from 1795 to 1808 under the sculptor Ivan Martos at the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg, and from 1818 to 1828 he was in Italy. His first works produced in Italy were in a classical style (e.g. Boy Blowing Bubbles, bronze, 1826, and Faun Listening to a Reed Flute, marble, 1824-30; both St Petersburg, Russian Museum). He also produced several portrait busts in Italy: V. A. Glinka (plaster, 1819) and A. Ya. Italinsky (marble, 1823; both St Petersburg, Russian Museum)."
1859,"GALEN, Nicolaes van",(active 1657 in Hasselt),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galen/biograph.html,"
A picture in the Hasselt Town Hall bears the signature and date 'N. van Galen F.A°.1657'. The painter is generally thought to have been Nicolaes van Galen, who is first recorded in Hasselt in 1647. He was the son of Juriaen van Galen and Rijkien van Ittersum, a woman of noble birth. In 1652, Nicolaes van Galen was in Kampen, where he had contact with the Amsterdam art dealer Jacob Ritsma. In 1676, he was the director of the hospital in Hasselt and in 1683 director of the municipal credit bank. It has been speculated that he was a member of the Hasselt patriciate and that he painted purely for his own pleasure.



"
1860,"GALEOTTI, Pietro Paolo","(b. 1520, Monte Rotondo, d. 1584, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galeotti/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, goldsmith and sculptor. The son of Pietro di Francesco, he was brought to Florence at a young age by Benvenuto Cellini, who described in his Vita how he found Galeotti in Rome in 1528. Galeotti accompanied Cellini to Ferrara and Paris in 1540 and worked in his Paris workshop with Ascanio de' Mari (d. 1566) in the Château du Petit-Nesle in 1548-49. He settled in Florence around 1552 and entered into the service of the Mint. He became a Florentine citizen in 1560. A payment to him from Cellini is recorded in January 1552, for chasing done on Cellini's Perseus. A sonnet of 1555 by the historian and critic Benedetto Varchi (I Sonetti, Venice, 1555) describes Galeotti as an equal rival of Domenico Poggini, another medallist also employed by the Mint. Briefly in 1575, Galeotti appears to have been an assistant engraver at the Papal Mint in Rome, taking the place of Lodovico Leoni (1542-1612).



"
1861,"GALEOTTI, Sebastiano","(b. 1676, Firenze, d. ca. 1746, Mondovi)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galeottx/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of the painters Alessandro Gherardini, Felice Torelli, and Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. He spent more than the last three decades of his life as a most successful fresco painter in Liguria, Lombardy, and Piedmont, practicing his truly international art."
1862,"GALILEI, Alessandro","(b. 1691, Firenze, d. 1737, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galilei/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, mathematician and engineer, member of the same patrician family as Galileo Galilei (1564-1742), the great astronomer and physicist. He received architectural and engineering training in Florence from Anton Maria Ferri, who lectured and wrote a treatise on perspective, fortifications and artillery. With him young Galilei worked on the study of building techniques, stereometry, hydraulics."
1863,"GALIZIA, Fede","(b. 1578, Milano, d. 1630, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galizia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. She was the daughter and pupil of Nunzio Galizia (active 1573-95), a miniature painter, who moved to Milan from Trento. She first came to notice by the age of 12, by 1596 she was well known for her portraits and religious works. Like many other female artists of that era, she learned her artistic skills from her father. The style of her portraits derived from the naturalistic traditions of the Renaissance in Italy, demonstrated in the work of such artists as Moretto da Brescia, Giovanni Battista Moroni and Lorenzo Lotto. However, the most important part of her oeuvre, for which she earned her place in art history, are her still-lifes which are among the earliest examples of this genre."
1864,"GALLAIT, Louis","(b. 1810, Tournai, d. 1887, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gallait/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. Although he came from an impoverished background, he entered the Académie of Tournai in 1823, where he worked first under Cornelis Cels and then under Philippe Auguste Hennequin, a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. Hennequin instilled in him the principles of Neo-classical drawing and had a profound influence on his choice of subject-matter. Gallait's first Classical subject, the Death of Epaminondas (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tournai), and his many early drawings show this influence clearly. Gallait's first success was with Caesar's Tribute (Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent) exhibited in 1832 at the Salon of Ghent."
1865,"GALLARDO, Mateo","(b. ca. 1600, Madrid, d. 1667, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gallardo/biograph.html,"

Flemish engraver and publisher, son of Philip Galle. He was also a pupil of his father. In 1596 he visited Rome with his brother Theodor and remained there perhaps until 1610, when he was in Antwerp and became a member of the city's Guild of St Luke. Shortly thereafter he founded a school of engraving in the city where many notable artists trained."
1867,"GALLE, Philip","(b. 1537, Haarlem, d. 1612, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galle/philip/biograph.html,"
The Galles were a Flemish family of artists and publishers of Dutch origin. The print workshop and publishing house founded by Philip Galle was one of the most important centres for engraving in Antwerp from the late 16th century to the early 17th. The business was continued by his sons Theodor Galle and Cornelis Galle I, who are chiefly known as reproductive engravers after compositions by Rubens and who, with their colleagues in the workshop, were among the first generation of engravers whose reputations were made by this work. Many of the title-pages and book illustrations produced in the Galle workshop were reprinted by the Plantin and Moretus presses. Philip's grandsons Cornelis Galle II and Joannes Galle continued the family business."
1868,"GALLE, Theodor","(b. 1571, Antwerpen, d. 1633, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galle/theodor/biograph.html,"
Theodor [Dirck] Galle, Flemish engraver, publisher and print dealer, son of Philip Galle. He was a pupil of his father. In 1596 he was admitted to the Antwerp Guild of St Luke and about the same time established a print-selling business. He travelled to Italy with his brother Cornelis in the same year. Theodor married the daughter of the Antwerp publisher Jan Moretus the elder and after his father's death in 1612 took over the direction of the Galle workshop and publishing house."
1869,"GALLE, Hieronymus","(b. 1625, Antwerpen, d. after 1679, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galle_h/biograph.html,"
Hieronymus (Girolamo) Galle, Flemish painter. He was the pupil of Abraham Hack (active 1623-1638). He joined the Sint-Lucasgilde (Guild of St. Luke) in Antwerp in 1636 and became master in 1645. He was active in Antwerp, but stayed in Rome in 1661-62"
1870,"GALLEGO, Fernando","(b. ca. 1440, Salamanca, d. 1507, Salamanca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gallego/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He worked mainly in Salamanca, where Palomino says he was born, and was the major Castilian painter of his period. Gallego's sober, impassive style has affinities with that of Dirk Bouts, and it has been suggested that he visited the Netherlands early in his career. His works include a retable (c.1475-80) of San Ildefonso in the cathedral of Zamora, a triptych of The Virgin, St Andrew and St Christopher in the new cathedral of Salamanca, and ceiling frescos on astrological subjects (much repainted) in the Old Library in the University of Salamanca. Gallego had considerable influence in Castile. One of his followers, Francisco Gallego, was presumably a relative.

Italian sculptor. He became a pupil of Thorvaldsen in Rome c. 1822. This year he is mentioned as working for Thorvaldsen and he also appears in the workshop accounts. When Thorvaldsen traveled to Denmark in 1838, Galli moved into his apartment in Casa Buti and ran the studios at Piazza Barberini until the sculptor's return in 1841."
1873,"GALLI, Agostino",(active 1560s in Prague),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galli1/biograph.html,"
Italian architect from Massagna near Lugano. He built for Jan Popel Lobkowicz the palace which is todays Schwarzenberg Palace at Hradcany Square in Prague. Also for Lobkovicz, he rebuilt a medieval bishop's castle in Horsovský Týn to a magnificent Renaissance chateau, although only the eastern entrance (completed 1559) and the southern wing, open to an arcaded courtyard with upstairs loggia, were realized."

Italian painter, part of a family of painters. He moved to Milan c. 1720, where according to tradition he worked as a craftsman modelling small nativity crib figures, until his talent was discovered by a member of the Clerici family. Little is known about his early development, although it seems likely that he was influenced by Giambattista Tiepolo, who was in Milan in 1730-31, and by Giovanni Battista Crosato. In 1735 Bernardino and his brother Fabrizio decorated the castle of the Visconti family at Brignano Gera d'Adda with trompe l'oeil architecture and landscape. Bernardino painted the figures, his brother the architecture. The figures are executed with long, even brushstrokes and have a clean, almost geometrical appearance. At Brignano he painted the Fall of the Giants, which is almost a replica of the fresco by Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Tè, Mantua. The style is strongly Baroque, typical of Bernardino's earlier work."
1875,"GALLIARI, Fabrizio","(b. 1709, Andorno Micca, d. 1790, Treviglio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galliari/fabrizio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and designer, part of a family of artist. Together with his brothers Bernardino and Giovanni Antonio, he worked mainly in Lombardy and Veneto but their work was required also in Piedmont, France, Austria and Prussia. The Galliari brothers were among the most important leaders in the eighteenth century in the field of Baroque scenography in European theatres.

1876,"GALLI BIBIENA, Carlo","(b. 1728, Wien, d. after 1778, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gallibib/carlo/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and scenographer, son of Giuseppe Galli Bibiena. As early as 1746 he was contributing to the decorations for the marriage of the daughter of the Margrave of Bayreuth. Two years later he was appointed supervisor of court decorations in Bayreuth. However, in the same year (1748) he acted as his father's assistant on the decoration of the new theatre there (much still in situ). In 1753 he undertook independently the decoration of a theatre in Munich (destroyed) for Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria. He returned to Bayreuth, but soon an arrangement was made whereby he was to spend half the year there and half as architect and theatre designer to the Margrave's brother-in-law, Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel."

Italian painter and draftsman. He is recorded among the followers of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. His known works, however, do not confirm a particular influence of the great Venetian master, rather, in an attempt to break free from Venetian pictorial tradition, they show his attention to Pietro Longhi and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo."
1880,"GALLOCHE, Louis","(b. 1670, Paris, d. 1761, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/galloche/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a pupil of Louis Boullogne the Younger. In 1695 he won the Prix de Rome and subsequently lived in Rome for two years. Because of a lull in royal patronage, Galloche was obliged, on his return to Paris, to accept commissions from churches and monasteries. Between 1706 and 1713 he painted, in collaboration with Louis de Silvestre, St Scholastica Praying for a Storm (Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) and scenes from the life of St Benedict for the refectory of St Martin-des-Champs, Paris. In 1711 he was received (reçu) as a member of the Académie Royale, Paris, on presentation of Hercules Restoring Alcestis to her Husband (École Nationale Supérieur des Beax-Arts, Paris). He became professor at the Académie in 1720, rector in 1746 and chancellor in 1754. Between 1737 and 1751 he exhibited regularly at the Salons."
1881,"GAMBARA, Lattanzio","(b. 1530, Brescia, d. 1574, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gambara/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. It is generally agreed that he received his early training with Giulio Campi in Cremona, where he developed his style, derived from Lombard and Emilian Mannerism. In 1549 Gambara returned to Brescia, where he became an assistant to Girolamo Romanino and married the latter's daughter in 1556. During the 1550s he collaborated with Romanino on the fresco cycles in the Averoldi and Bargnani palaces in Brescia, where he made some accommodation in his style to Romanino's, though demonstrating his innate eclecticism. His first important independent commissions were the façade frescoes (c. 1557) on the Case del Gambero (Brescia). Here, Gambara fused the decorative elegance of Parmigianino and Camillo Boccaccino with the Michelangelesque qualities of Giulio Romano and Pordenone."
1882,"GAMBELLO, Antonio di Marco","(active 1458, d. 1481, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gambello/antonio/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He was the father of Vittore Gambello, sculptor and medallist. He was appointed chief architect to San Zaccaria, Venice, in 1458, and worked on it all his life (it was completed by Mauro Codussi).



"
1883,"GAMBELLO, Vittore","(b. ca. 1455, Venezia, d. 1537, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gambello/vittore/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist and sculptor (also known as Camelio), son of Antonio di Marco Gambello, architect and sculptor. He studied drawing under Giovanni Bellini. The earliest references to him document his employment as maestro della stampe at the Venetian Mint in 1484. He perfected a method for stamping medals in high relief rather than casting them in sand or by the lost-wax process; this allowed the easier production of medals in larger editions.



"
1884,"GAMEREN, Tylman van","(b. 1632, Utrecht, d. 1706, Warszawa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gameren/biograph.html,"
Dutch architect and painter, active in Poland as Tylman Gamerski, but also worked widely in Europe. At the age of 28, he settled in Poland and worked for Queen Marie Casimire, wife of Poland's King Jan III Sobieski."
1885,GANDOLFINO DA RORETO,(active 1493-1510 in Piedmont),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gandolf/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also called Gandolfino d'Asti. He was born in Asti and active in Piedmont, working in Asti, Alessandria and Montferrat. He was apprenticed under his father, Giovanni da Roreto, but no works are known from that period. His first documented work is an Assumption with Saints (1493, Galleria Sabauda, Turin). His style was influenced by that of Ligurian and Provençal artists, such as Louis Bréa. Later he was also influenced by Milanese painters such as Bergognone and Bernardo Zenale."
1886,"GANDOLFI, Gaetano","(b. 1734, S Matteo della Decima, d. 1802, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gandolfi/gaetano/biograph.html,"
Painter, draughtsman, sculptor and etcher, part of an Italian family of artists. The work of the brothers Ubaldo Gandolfi and Gaetano Gandolfi and of the latter's son, Mauro Gandolfi, reflects the transition from late Bolognese Baroque through Neo-classicism and into early Italian Romanticism. During their period of collective productivity, from c. 1760 to c. 1820, the Gandolfi produced paintings, frescoes, drawings, sculptures and prints. Their drawings (examples by all three artists, Venice, Fondazione Cini) made an outstanding contribution to the great figurative tradition of Bolognese draughtsmanship that had begun with the Carracci. Their prolific output and their activity as teachers gave them considerable influence throughout northern Italy, except in Venice. One of Ubaldo's five children, Giovanni Battista Gandolfi (b 1762), trained at the Accademia Clementina, Bologna, but apart from a vault fresco signed and dated 1798 in the church of S Francesco in Bagnacavallo nothing is known of his adult career. A drawing (Paris, Fondacione Custodia) is signed Ubaldo Lorenzo Gandolfi, who may have been another son. Mauro's daughter, Clementina Gandolfi (b 1795), was an artist and amateur musician, and his son by a second marriage, Democrito Gandolfi (b 1796), studied with Antonio Canova but was an unsuccessful sculptor. He delivered a eulogy at Mauro's funeral and sculpted the portrait bust that stands on the tomb of Gaetano and Mauro in the Certosa di Bologna."

1889,"GANDY, Joseph Michael","(b. 1771, London, d. 1843, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gandy/biograph.html,"
English artist, architect and theorist who gained notoriety for luminous and imaginative paintings based on practical architectural designs. He remains known as one of the greatest illustrators of architecture in British history.



"
1890,GANO DI FAZIO,"(active from 1302, d. before 1318, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gano/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was one of the founders of the Sienese school of sculpture in the 14th century. The first documentary reference to him is on 23 May 1302, when he purchased land in Siena; in the same year, on 18 June, he paid tax on this purchase. His only certain work is the signed tomb monument (Casole d'Elsa, Collegiate Church) of Tommaso d'Andrea, Bishop of Pistoia. It was probably executed in 1303-04 and is the earliest existing example of a complete Sienese funerary monument. Facing it, and possibly executed by Gano not long after, is the wall-tomb of Porrina, Lord of Casole and Radi di Montagna (d 1313). The portrait of Porrina is remarkable for its realism, and the tomb is unique among Tuscan sculpture of this period in that it presents a full-length standing figure beneath a Gothic canopy."
1891,"GARBIERI, Lorenzo","(b. 1580, Bologna, d. 1654, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garbieri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a follower of Lodovico Carracci, creating a more rigid yet at times powerfully expressionist style in response to the master's emotionalism. His closeness to his teacher can be seen in the early fresco, Lamentation (1600-02; oratory of San Colombano, Bologna), and in the Flagellation that forms part of the Mysteries of the Rosary (San Domenico, Bologna) traditionally attributed to Lodovico himself."
1892,"GARCIA, Pere",(active 1455-1479 in Barcelona),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garcia/biograph.html,"
Pere (Pedro) García, Catalan painter, He came from Benabarra in Huesca, was active in Barcelona around 1455 and in Lérida around 1460. He is also mentioned in records dated 1479. His pictures display a felicitous blend of Flemish and Italian influences.



"
1893,"GARCÍA DE QUIÑONES, Andrés","(b. 1709, Santiago de Compostela, d. 1784, Santiago de Compostela)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garcia_q/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect and sculptor, active mainly in Salamanca. In the years between 1750 and 1755 he completed his best known work, the Plaza Mayor and the town hall in Salamanca. The long-drawn-out construction of the Jesuit college of La Clerecia in Salamanca had been stagnating. He completed it with towers, belfry and the inner courtyard. As a sculptor, he produced several altars for churches.



"
1894,"GAREMIJN, Jan Antoon",(1712-1799),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garemijn/biograph.html,"
Flemish Rococo painter, the only Bruges painter to rise above mediocrity with his lively technique. He has been called - somewhat chauvinistically and flatteringly - the Flemish Boucher. In reality, he was a cheerful, popular narrator and talented craftsman, fascinated by the picturesque, coarse or even grotesque detail. Garemijn modelled his style on that of the genre painters of the seventeenth century, especially David Teniers. He was frequently asked to decorate dining rooms and salons, many of which survive in their original condition in stately homes and castles."
1895,"GARGIULO, Domenico","(b. ca. 1609, Napoli, d. ca. 1675, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gargiulo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He received the nickname Micco Spadaro because his father was a maker of swords (spade). He was trained from about 1628 in the workshop of Aniello Falcone, where Andrea di Leone (d. 1677) and Salvator Rosa were also studying; de Dominici recounts that Gargiulo and Rosa painted landscapes in the open air in the Neapolitan countryside. His early works were influenced by Paul Bril, who in 1602 had painted landscape frescoes in the atrium of Santa Maria Regina Coeli, Naples, and by the vivid realism of Filippo Napoletano's small landscapes. The latter arrived in Naples in 1627-28 and may have stimulated Gargiulo's interest in the etchings of Jacques Callot and Stefano della Bella."
1896,"GARNIER, Etienne-Barthélemy","(b. 1759, Paris, d. 1849, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garnie/biograph.html,"
French painter. Although he was given a sound Classical education to prepare for the magistrature, he found a painter's career more alluring. Despite his late start, he had an impeccable record of success in competition with the pupils of Jacques-Louis David, whose influence he mostly resisted. Trained by Louis-Jacques Durameau, Gabriel-François Doyen and Joseph-Marie Vien, he won second place in the Prix de Rome competition in 1787 with Death of Sedecius (Le Mans, Musée Tessé) and first place in 1788 with a strenuously rhetorical Death of Tatius (Paris, École Normale Supérieure des Beax-Arts, Paris). Although his stay in Italy was abruptly ended by the Roman crisis of 1793, he completed before his return to Paris the course work and other pictures, including an academic study of St Jerome (Troyes, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and several Classical subjects."
1897,"GARNIER, François","(b. ca. 1600, Paris, d. 1672, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garnier/biograph.html,"
French painter. He is well known mainly for the fact that he was Louise Moillon's father-in-law - he married her mother when she became a widow on 17th August 1620. He was described in the marriage contract as ""a bourgeois living in Paris"", so we can assume that he was quite a rich man. He lived in the Ile de la Cité and also sold pictures as well as being a painter - in 1627 he bought a booth at the Saint Germain fair in rue Merciere and enlarged it at a later date. When his wife died in 1630, he married Denise du Pont, the widow of Jacques Le Sage, a goldsmith."
1898,"GARNIER, Charles","(b. 1825, Paris, d. 1898, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garnierc/biograph.html,"
French architect of the Beaux-Arts style, famed as the creator of the Paris Opera House. He was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts in 1842 and was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome in 1848 to study in Italy. He won the 1860 competition for the new Paris Opera House. One of the most famous buildings of the century, the Opéra (completed 1875) became a symbol of Second Empire taste, and its eclectic neo-Baroque style became characteristic of late 19th-century Beaux-Arts design. Garnier's command of the sweeping interiors was equalled by his mastery of balance, punctuation, and termination of mass and surface."
1899,"GARNIER, Louis","(b. ca. 1639, Paris, d. 1728, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garnierl/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was Professeur and later Doyen of the Académie de St Luc in Paris and is sometimes confused in contemporary documents with the sculptor Pierre Granier (1635-1715). Garnier was a bronze specialist employed by François Girardon to repair the waxes bronzes at the Paris Arsenal from 1686 to 1692. He was also responsible for such small bronze groups and statuettes as Paetus and Arria (1696-97; Paris, Louvre) and Bacchus (before 1699). He also executed funerary monuments in bronze and marble, including the monument for the brain of James II of England (1703; fragments, Paris, former Collège des Ecossais, 65 Rue Cardinal-Lemoine), the tomb of Maximilien Titon du Tillet (after 1711; destroyed) for the chapel of the convent of the Hospitalières at St Mandé and the tomb for the heart of Louis-François, Maréchal de Boufflers (1713; fragments, Crillon, Oise, parish church)."
1900,GAROFALO,"(b. 1481, Ferrara, d. 1559, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garofalo/biograph.html,"
Garofalo (Benvenuto Tisi), Italian painter, active mainly in Ferrara. Vasari says that he twice visited Rome, and his work - derivative but beautifully crafted - was heavily influenced by Raphael. He was the first to paint in such a manner in Ferrara and was influential in spreading the High Renaissance style. His output was large (frescos, altarpieces, small devotional works, also a few mythologies); there are many examples in Ferrarese churches and, for example, in the National Gallery, London. In 1550 he went blind.



"
1901,"GAROLI, Pietro Francesco","(b. 1638, Giaveno, d. 1716, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garola/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After his activities as a restorer at the court of the Royal House of Savoy in Turin, he went to Venice to study perspective painting. Later he worked in Bologna, then in Rome as a painter of views. From 1679 he was teacher of perspective at the Academy of San Luca. He resumed contact with the court in Turin, executing paintings which are now in the Galleria Sabauda, Turin."
1902,"GARRARD, George","(b. 1760, London, d. 1826, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garrard/biograph.html,"
English animal painter, sculptor, modeller and printmaker. He came from a family of artists, tracing his descent back to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger who was a painter to Queen Elizabeth I of England and her successor Anne of Denmark. He played a major role in lobbying Parliament to introduce legislation to protect the copyright of works by modellers of animal and human figures."
1903,"GÄRTNER, Eduard","(b. 1801, Berlin, d. 1877, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gartner/biograph.html,"
German painter. He studied with Carl Gropius, a decorative painter and friend of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. He attended the Berlin Academy, and painted at the Berlin Porcelain Manufactory. Prussia's king had also sent him for special landscape study in Paris under Ingres's friend François Edouard Bertin."
1904,"GÄRTNER, Friedrich von","(b. 1791, Koblenz, d. 1847, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gartner1/biograph.html,"
German architect, who worked in the Romantic Neoclassical style. His father was also an architect, and moved in 1804 to Munich, where young Gärtner received his first education in architecture (1808-12) under Karl von Fischer (1782-1820). After training with Weinbrenner in Karlsruhe (1812-13), he went in 1814 to Paris, where he studied under Percier and Fontaine, before making the obligatory tour of Italy, where he spent four years in the earnest study of antiquities. The fruits of this labour appeared in 1819 in some views accompanied by descriptions of the principal monuments of Sicily (Ansichten der am meisten erhaltenen Monumente Siciliens). His stay in Italy was followed by a visit to The Netherlands and England, where he was fascinated by industrial architecture."
1905,"GÄRTNER, Georg the Younger","(b. ca. 1577, Nürnberg, d. 1654, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gartner2/biograph.html,"
German painter and engraver. The son of the artist Georg Gärtner the Elder (d. 1612), he probably worked with his father until 1612. He executed 44 signed plates illustrating the Funeral Procession of Margrave Frederick of Brandenburg (1613; British Museum, London) and also helped illustrate B. Beseler's natural science compendium, the Hortus Eichstettensis (Nuremberg, 1613; complete copy, Nuremberg, Stadtbibliothek), which he signed appropriately in Latin as 'Georg Hortulanus'. On 8 April 1613 Nuremberg city council commissioned him to work alongside Gabriel Weyer, Paul Juvenel I and Jobst Harrich to restore the wall paintings designed by Dürer for the Nuremberg Rathaussaal (destroyed 1945). This restoration was undertaken first in 1613-14, then in a second phase in 1619."
1906,"GARZI, Luigi","(b. 1638, Pistoia, d. 1721, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. At the age of 15 he entered the Roman workshop of Andrea Sacchi, from whom he acquired the classical training that served him throughout his career. Among his earliest works is the Triumph of St Catherine and All Saints (Rome, Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli), which clearly shows the influence of Emilian painting, particularly that of Reni. Another early canvas is St Silvestro Shows Constantine Portraits of SS Peter and Paul (Rome, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme)."
1907,"GARZONI, Giovanna","(b. 1600, Ascoli Piceno, d. 1670, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/garzoni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of the first woman artists to practice the art of still-life painting. She may have begun her training in Ascoli Piceno. In 1625, and again in 1630, she was in Venice, where she wrote a calligraphy book, including capital letters illuminated with fruits, flowers, birds, and insects. These subjects were to become her specialty, and tempera on vellum was her preferred medium."
1908,"GASCAR, Henri","(b. ca. 1634, Paris, d. 1701, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gascar/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was perhaps the son of Pierre Gascar, an obscure painter and sculptor. In 1659 he made his first journey to Rome. He had probably returned to Paris by 1667, although he may have been in the Netherlands that year when he executed his fine portrait of Nicolas Delafond (St Petersburg, Hermitage), a journalist from Amsterdam. The informality of the pose and the simplicity of the sitter's expression are reminiscent of contemporary Dutch portraits by such painters as Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp and Ferdinand Bol, but the elegance of gesture and the extremely refined treatment of drapery are entirely French."
1909,GASPARE DA PADOVA,(active 1466-1517 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaspare/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator, also called Gaspare Romano. The birth date of this Paduan artist is not known, he was active in Rome in the 1480s. In 1483, together with Bartolomeo Sanvito, he was among the family member and guests of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in Rome. He was probably trained in Padua and in the Veneto in the circle of Marco Zoppo. It was suggested that his early works can be identified with those of the so-called Master of the Putti, a Paduan manuscript illuminator active between 1469 and 1478."
1910,"GASPARI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1660, Veneto, d. after 1730, Castelguglielmo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaspari/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and architectural painter, active in both Venice and the terrafirma of the Veneto. He was a pupil of Baldassare Longhena, and upon his master's death in 1682, he completed some of his projects, including Longhena's most famous work, the church of Santa Maria della Salute, and the Ca' Pesaro. Although he was more famous for restoration and modernisation work rather than new buildings, he designed the large Baroque building Ca' Zenobio in Venice."
1911,"GASSEL, Lucas","(b. 1495/1500, Helmond, d. ca. 1570, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gassel/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. According to van Mander, he worked in Brussels and was a friend of Domenicus Lampsonius (1532-99), who included Gassel in his Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies (1572). Gassel, whom van Mander described as a good but unproductive painter, belonged to the Joachim Patenier and Herri met de Bles tradition of landscape painters. He preferred panoramic rocky and mountainous views with a high horizon and a plethora of details, but his works have a character of their own and are not mere slavish imitations. The rocks and mountains have less fanciful silhouettes and are generally placed further into the background of the composition. The sparse and generally dark brown foreground flows gradually into the empty blue-green but distinct mountainous distance. The figures in Gassel's paintings are generally of a thick-set build with large heads; yet they add colour to the otherwise dull foreground."
1912,"GASSIES, Jean-Bruno","(b. 1786, Bordeaux, d. 1832, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gassies/biograph.html,"
French painter. He entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1814 and studied with François-André Vincent, Pierre Lacour (1745-1814) and Jacques-Louis David. As well as historical subjects, he produced landscapes, marine views, allegories and religious paintings."
1913,GATTAPONE,"(b. ca. 1300, Gubbio, d. 1383, Gubbio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gattapon/biograph.html,"
Matteo di Giovanello, called Gattapone, Italian architect, native of Gubbio. He built a number of important fortress-palaces, such as the Collegio di Spagna in Bologna, the fortress in Spoleto, and the citadel at Porte Sole in Perugia. Gattapone and Angelo da Orvieto played major roles in the completion of the Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio (1332-37), which with its characteristic battlements and bell tower is not unlike the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The Palazzo dei Consoli is generally considered one of the finest medieval public palaces in Italy.



"
1914,"GATTI, Bernardino","(b. ca. 1495, Pavia, d. 1576, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gatti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In some documents he is said to have come from Pavia. His first documented work, the Resurrection (1529; Cremona Cathedral), shows that he had a thorough knowledge of Correggio's work and of the classicizing manner of Raphael and Giulio Romano. Correggio's influence became increasingly apparent, although it was blended with Lombard archaisms, as in the Virgin of the Rosary (1531; Pavia Cathedral) and in the Resurrection with the Virgin and St John the Baptist and the Last Supper (1534-35; both Vigevano Cathedral). In the frescoes of St George and the Dragon and scenes from the Life of the Virgin (1543; both Piacenza, Santa Maria di Campagna) he tried to refine his style further, still drawing on Giulio and Correggio but achieving only a somewhat bloodless sentimentality. This is evident in the Crucifixion (Piacenza, Municipio)."
1915,"GAUCHER, Charles-Étienne","(b. 1741, Paris, d. 1804, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaucher/biograph.html,"
French engraver and writer. He trained as a reproductive engraver with Pierre-François Basan and later with Jacques-Philippe Lebas but soon turned to small-scale engraving. He specialized in the extremely meticulous execution of small portraits; he made more than 100 of these, the most popular being those of Marie Leczinska, Queen of France (1768) after Jean-Marc Nattier and the portrait of the Comtesse du Barry (1770) after Hubert Drouais. His greatest work was the Crowning of the Bust of Voltaire at the Comédie Française after a drawing by Jean-Michel Moreau (1778; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), on which he worked from 1778 to 1782."
1916,"GAUDREAUS, Antoine-Robert","(b. ca. 1682, Paris, d. 1746, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gaudreau/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker. He became a maître-ébéniste c. 1710 and from 1724 became the main supplier to the Garde Meuble de la Couronne. From 1726 until his death, first as Ébéniste de la Reine and then as Ébéniste du Roi, he exercised a virtual monopoly over commissions intended for royal residences, most of which he subcontracted."
1917,"GAUFFIER, Louis","(b. 1762, Poitiers, d. 1801, Livorno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gauffier/biograph.html,"
French painter. Following his move to Paris, where he became a pupil of Hugues Taraval (1729-1785) and a student at the Académie Royale, in 1784 Gauffier shared the Prix de Rome with Jean-Germain Drouais and Antoine-Denis Chaudet (for sculpture), his own work being Christ and the Woman of Canaan (École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris)."
1918,"GAUGUIN, Paul","(b. 1848, Paris, d. 1903, Atuona, Hiva Oa, French Polynesia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gauguin/biograph.html,"
Eugene-Henri-Paul Gauguin, French painter, sculptor, and printmaker. He was the son of Clovis Gauguin, a liberal journalist from Orléans and Aline Chazal, a French-Peruvian (Creole) mother. He spent his childhood in Lima, Peru, between 1851 and 1855. In 1865 he entered the Navy and became an assistant pilot in the Merchant Marine. He traveled the Atlantic Ocean between Le Havre and Rio de Janeiro. An officer on board gave him a glowing account of the two years he had spent in Polynesia."
1919,"GAUSSON, Léo","(b. 1860, Lagny-sur-Marne, d. 1944, Lagny-sur-Marne)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gausson/biograph.html,"
French painter. His interest in art was awakened at an early age in the studio of the graphic artist Eugène Froment, a friend of the family. He began as a wood sculptor, then studied graphics, finally turning to painting. At the Atelier Froment he met Maximilien Luce and Cavallo-Peduzzi. As an innovative artist, he enthusiastically partook in two artistic movements, which emerged nearly at the same time, Neo-Impressionism and Synthetism based on very different aesthetic concepts. He was influenced by Camille Pissarro, Paul Signac, Luce, van Gogh, Gauguin, and Émile Bernard."
1920,"GAUTIER-DAGOTY, Jacques-Fabien","(b. 1716, Marseille, d. 1785, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gautier/biograph.html,"
French engraver, part of a family of engravers. The father of the family, Jacques-Fabien Gautier-Dagoty, is noted for his pioneering work in four-colour engraving and for the publication and illustration of scientific works. His eldest son, Jean-Baptiste-André Gautier-Dagoty, also became an engraver of scientific illustrations. The other four sons likewise were their father's pupils and used his methods.



"
1921,"GAVARNI, Paul","(b. ca. 1804, Paris, d. 1866, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gavarni/biograph.html,"
French caricaturist and illustrator, real name Guillaume Sulpice Chevalier. He was born in Paris and largely self-taught as an artist. He began his career as an engraver and after 1830 was a fashion illustrator. Subsequently he became a caricaturist, specializing in satiric studies of Parisian life, which he contributed to a number of Parisian periodicals, including the magazine Charivari. Among his better-known works are the series Les fourberies de femme en matière de sentiment (Treachery of Women in Matters of Sentiment) and Les lorettes (The Prostitutes)."
1922,"GAYRARD, Paul Joseph Raymond","(b. 1807, Clermont-Ferrand, d. 1855, Enghein-les-Bains)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gayrard/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied at an early age under his sculptor/engraver father Raymond Gayrard (1777-1858) and was a student of François Rude as well as David d'Angers. Gayrard first exhibited at the Salon in 1827 and continued to submit works throughout his lifetime winning a Second Class Medal in 1834 and a First Class Medal in 1846. His last recorded exhibit was in 1855."
1923,"GEEFS, Guillaume","(b. 1805, Antwerpen, d. 1883, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geefs/biograph.html,"
Belgian sculptor. He was the eldest of six brothers in a family of sculptors. The best-known among his brothers are Joseph Geefs (1808-1885, winner of the Prix de Rome in 1836) and Jean Geefs (1825-1860, and winner of the prize in 1846)."
1924,"GEEL, Jacob van","(b. ca. 1585, Middelburg, d. after 1638, Dordrecht?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Nothing is known about his training as a painter. At some time around the turn of the century he became a member of the Middelburg Guild of Saint Luke, in which he served as both headman (1615-17) and dean (1617-18) Most of the surviving documents from his Middelburg period refer to his mounting debt. By 1626, possibly in an attempt to escape his creditors, the artist had moved to Delft. One year later Van Geel - then apparently a widower - married the widow Lisbeth Schraven. The marriage was evidently not successful, for the couple initiated divorce in 1629. Nevertheless, they were still living together at the time of Lisbeth's death in 1632."
1925,"GEEL, Jan Frans van","(b. 1756, Mechelen, d. 1830, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geel_j/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. He was taught by Willem Jacob Herreyns and, later on, Pieter Valckx. In 1784 he became a faculty member of the Mechelen Academy; later on, he would teach at the Antwerp Academy as well. His students included, among others, Willem Geefs, Louis Royer and Joseph Tuerlinckx. Stylistically, van Geel continued the late Flemish Baroque tradition, although he was not wholly unaware of the upcoming Neoclassicist movement."
1926,GEERTGEN tot Sint Jans,"(b. 1460/65, Leiden, d. 1490, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geertgen/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, active in Haarlem. Almost nothing is known of his career. He was a pupil of Ouwater and he died when he was about 28. His name means
""Little Gerard of the Brethren of St John"", after the Order in Haarlem of which he was a lay-brother."
1927,"GEETS, Willem","(b. 1838, Mechelen, d. 1919, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geets/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. He began his artistic studies at the Academy in Mechelen. In 1854 he left Mechelen for Antwerp, where he attended the School of Fine Art for two years. His first teacher, Nicaise de Keyser, one of the first important romantic painters in Belgium, frowned upon natural studies and forced his pupil to work on lavish and antiquated local cloth. Baron Hendrick Leys, Geets's next tutor, painted reconstructions of 16th century Antwerp and sought to convey the spirit of an earlier time. Leys distanced himself from the dramatic and seemed to herald a more sober style, an approach that more accurately reflected the national heritage. Geets developed the same preoccupation with the past, inherited a loyalty to 17th Dutch interiors and a love of the French Realists. Geets was also taught by Léon Cogniet (1794-1880) in Paris (1861-63)."
1928,"GEFFELS, Frans","(b. 1624, Antwerpen, d. 1694, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geffels/biograph.html,"

1929,"GEIKIE, Walter","(b. 1795, Edinburgh, d. 1837, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geikie/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter and printmaker. Born in Edinburgh the son of a pharmacist, Walter Geikie was struck by a fever which left him deaf and dumb before his second birthday. In 1812 he enrolled in the Trustees Academy, having previously studied drawing. Three years later he first exhibited his work at the Edinburgh Exhibition Society. Geikie later exhibited regularly at the Royal Institution and the Scottish Academy of which he became an Associate in 1831 and an academician in 1834. Largely remembered for his etchings, Walter Geikie's Etchings Illustrative of Scottish Character and Scenery was published in 1841, three years after his death.



"
1930,"GELATI, Lorenzo","(b. 1824, Firenze, d. 1893, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gelati/biograph.html,"
Italian painter associated with the Macchiaioli group. Around 1850 he attended the Caffè Michelangelo without being a regular member. In 1852 he decorated there the rooms used by the artists with two mural paintings, Tramonto (sunset) and Ruins with the Moon. His compositions are similar to those of Odoardo Borrani up to the point that some of them were attributed to the latter. In the period 1861-62 he regularly visited Castiglioncello where he painted several views.



"
1931,"GELDER, Aert de","(b. 1645, Dordrecht, d. 1727, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gelder/biograph.html,"

1932,"GELDORP, Gortzius","(b. 1553, Leuven, d. after 1619, Köln)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geldorp/father/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, member of a family of painters. Most of his surviving work was painted in Cologne around the turn of the 17th century. His son George Geldorp worked as a painter and art dealer in England in the mid-17th century."
1933,"GELDORP, Georg","(b. ca. 1590, Cologne, d. 1665, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/geldorp/son/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England, part of a family of painters. Born in either Cologne or Antwerp, he was the son of Gortzius Geldorp. He was admitted Master in the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp in 1610. In 1613 he married a daughter of Willem de Vos (active 1593-1629). He came to London from Antwerp in 1623. He painted a number of portraits in the Anglo-Netherlandish style, close in conception to the work of Daniel Mijtens (i) or Paulus van Somer. The most important are those of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury and his wife Catherine (both 1626; Hatfield House, Herts). The handling is less accomplished and the figures more stiffly articulated than in the work of Mijtens, but the surfaces are decorative and the background of the portrait of the Earl contains an historically important view of Hatfield House with sportsmen in the foreground."
1934,"GEMITO, Vincenzo","(b. 1852, Napoli, d. 1929, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gemito/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and draughtsman. He was a child of the streets, who was adopted by a poor artisan. In 1861, at only nine years of age, he entered the workshop of the sculptor Emanuele Caggiano (1837-1905) as an assistant and dogsbody. Around this time he formed a close friendship with the painter Antonio Mancini; together they frequented the studio of Stanislao Lista (1824-1908), a sculptor and painter of a more advanced tendency. There Gemito learnt to model in clay and wax, and he is supposed to have been encouraged by Lista to study the life of the streets. After leaving Lista's studio Gemito set up independently in an abandoned convent, working alongside Mancini and the sculptors Achille D'Orsi and Giovanni Battista Amendola (1848-1887)."
1935,"GENGA, Girolamo","(b. 1476, Urbino, d. 1551, La Valle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/genga/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect. Vasari stated that he was first apprenticed to Luca Signorelli, probably when the latter went to Urbino in 1494. From c. 1498 until 1501 he was active in Pietro Perugino's workshop, where he probably met Raphael. He later went to Florence, remaining there for some years, according to Vasari, before going to Siena, though the sequence of his movements between 1501 and c. 1513 is disputed. His career is unlikely to have followed the neat progression implied by Vasari, and it is more reasonable to consider the artist as relatively mobile, moving between different artistic centres.



"
1936,"GENNARI, Benedetto I","(b. 1563, Cento, d. 1658, Cento)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gennari/benedet1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters. He adopted a style influenced by Caravaggio, and by age 19, was working in the household of Mirandola in Cento. In Cento, he helped to decorate the Palazzo della Comunità and the church of Spirito Santo. Guercino became his apprentice in 1607. His nephews Benedetto II Gennari and Cesare Gennari, sons of his brother Ercole, were also painters.



"
1937,"GENNARI, Benedetto II","(b. 1633, Cento, d. 1715, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gennari/benedet2/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters. He trained with Guercino in Bologna, and his early works, such as the Investiture of St Chiara (1656-57; Pieve di Cento, S Chiara), are close to the style of Guercino. On Guercino's death he and his brother Cesare Gennari directed the studio."
1938,"GENNARI, Cesare","(b. 1637, Cento, d. 1688, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gennari/cesare/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of an Italian family of painters. The family, which originated in Cento, comprised Benedetto Gennari I (1563-1658); his two sons Ercole Gennari (1597-1658) and Bartolommeo Gennari (1594-1661), who married Lucia, the sister of Guercino; Lorenzo Gennari (1595-1665/72), who was descended from another branch of the family; and Ercole's two sons, Cesare Gennari (1637-88) and Benedetto Gennari II. These artists were closely associated with Guercino, and their work, with the exception of that of Benedetto II, has been difficult to identify among the many paintings from Guercino's studio."
1939,GENTILE DA FABRIANO,"(b. 1370, Fabriano, d. 1427, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gentile/biograph.html,"
Italian painter in the International Gothic style. Originally named Gentile di Niccolò di Giovanni di Massio, he was named after his birthplace, Fabriano in the Marches. He carried out important commissions in several major Italian art centres and was recognized as one of the foremost artists of his day, but most of the work on which his great contemporary reputation was based has been destroyed. It included frescos in the Doges' Palace in Venice (1408) and for St John Lateran in Rome (1427). In between he worked in Florence, Siena, and Orvieto."
1940,"GENTILESCHI, Artemisia","(b. 1597, Roma, d. 1651, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gentiles/artemisi/biograph.html,"
Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi (1563-1639) was one of the greatest of Caravaggesque painters and a formidable personality. She was precociously gifted, built up a European reputation, and lived a life of independence rare for a woman of the time. Born in Rome, she worked mainly there and in Florence until she settled in Naples in 1630 (she also visited her father in England in 1638-40).

"
1941,"GENTILESCHI, Orazio","(b. 1563, Pisa, d. 1639, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gentiles/orazio/biograph.html,"Italian painter, originally Orazio Lomi, he was born in Pisa, but in about 1576 he settled in Rome. Coming from a family of artists, whose tradition was continued by his brilliant daughter Artemesia, Orazio Gentileschi trained in one of his uncles' studios in Rome. His own career, however, was slow in starting and he was almost 40 before it really got underway. Then in the first decade of the seventeenth century friendship with Caravaggio brought about a sudden change. After working in a Mannerist style he became one of the closest and most gifted of Caravaggio's followers. He was one of the few Caravaggisti who was a friend of the master, and in 1603 he and Caravaggio and two other artists were sued for libel by Giovanni Baglione.
"
1942,"GENTZ, Heinrich","(b. 1766, Breslau, d. 1811, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gentz/biograph.html,"
German architect. He worked in the Neoclassical style and developed a style of simple, clear forms. His important works are the Münze (Royal Mint) at the Werderschenmarkt, Berlin (1798-1800), and the Theater in Lauchstädt (1802). He was also involved in the conversion of the Weimar castle.

1944,"GÉRARD, François","(b. 1770, Roma, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gerard/biograph.html,"
French painter, born in Rome, a favourite pupil of Jacques-Louis David. In the  Salon of 1796 he won acclaim with his portrait of Jean-Baptiste Isabey and his Daughter (Louvre, Paris) and became the most sought after court and society portraitist of his day. He successfully negotiated the various political changes of the day and was made a Baron and a member of the Legion of Honour. In addition to portraits Gérard painted  historical and mythological works. His style derived from David, but was much less taut and heroic, tending at times towards a rather mannered gracefulness.



"
1945,"GÉRARD, Marguerite","(b. 1761. Grasse, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gerard_m/biograph.html,"
French painter. After the death of her mother in 1775 she left Grasse to join her elder sister Marie-Anne and her sister's husband Jean-Honoré Fragonard in their quarters in the Louvre in Paris. Marguerite became Fragonard's protégé and lived for the next 30 years in the Louvre, where she was exposed to the greatest art and artists of the past and present. By 1785 she had already established a reputation as a gifted genre painter, the first French woman to do so, and by the late 1780s came to be considered one of the leading women artists in France, the equal of Adelaide Labille-Guiard, Anne Vallayer-Coster and Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun. Although she also produced oil portraits, portrait miniatures, and etchings, Marguerite Gérard is best known for her intimate domestic genre scenes."

The artist, born between 1540 and 1550 at Hertogenbosch, belongs to the generation of Dutch sculptors who introduced into the German courts an international style that, fused with traditional local elements, paved the way for the great flowering of Baroque art."
1948,"GÉRICAULT, Théodore","(b. 1791, Rouen, d. 1824, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gericaul/biograph.html,"
French painter, one of the prime movers and most original figures of Romanticism. He studied in Paris with Carle Vernet and Pierre Guérin, but was influenced more by making copies of the Old Masters at the Louvre, developing in particular a passion for Rubens. In 1816-17 he was in Italy and there became an enthusiastic admirer of Michelangelo and the Baroque."
1949,"GERMAIN, François-Thomas","(b. 1726, Paris, d. 1791, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/germain/biograph.html,"
French silversmith, part of a family of silversmiths, son of Thomas Germain (1674-1748). On the death of his father, he was allowed to take over his father's lodgings in the Louvre, Paris, and was appointed Sculpteur-Orfèvre du Roi. He completed items commissioned from Thomas Germain (e.g. lamp, 1744-54, for Ste Geneviève, Paris) and also modified earlier pieces by his father, for example a pair of tureens and stands (1726-28; Malibu, CA, Getty Museum), which have an inscription on the stands added by François-Thomas in 1764. He also continued to use his father's casting models."
1950,"GÉRÔME, Jean-Léon","(b. 1824, Vesoul, d. 1904, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gerome/biograph.html,"
French painter, sculptor, and teacher. Son of a goldsmith, he studied in Paris and painted melodramatic and often erotic historical and mythological compositions, excelling as a draftsman in the linear style of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. In Paris, he struggled, painting religious cards and selling them on the steps of churches in order to survive. After a few years, he left for Italy."
1951,"GERRITSZ., Joost",(1598-1652),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gerritsz/biograph.html,"

German painter, printmaker, and tapestry designer. He was one of Hans Schäufelein's pupils in Nördlingen. By 1525, he had settled in Lauingen, a Bavarian city on the banks of the River Danube in the Duchy of Neuburg. His major patron was Otto Heinrich, the protestant Elector Palatine of the Rhine. He was employed as local inspector from 1531 to 1567."
1953,"GERVEX, Henri","(b. 1852, Paris, d. 1929, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gervex/biograph.html,"

He then studied under Alexandre Cabanel at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his fellow pupils included Henri Regnault, Bastien-Lepage, Forain, Humbert (1842-1934) and Cormon; and also informally with Fromentin."
1954,"GHEERAERTS, Marcus the Younger","(b. 1561, Brugge, d. ca. 1636, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gheeraer/biograph.html,"
Flemish-born portrait painter, who settled in England in 1568 with his father Marcus the Elder (c.1530-c.1590), an engraver and painter. He spent his early years in Bruges, but at the age of seven they moved to London. Marcus the Younger was trained as a painter there by his father and by the painter Lucas de Heere, who had also left Flanders for religious reasons, remaining in London until 1577. It is likely that at the end of the 1580s Marcus the Younger again spent some time in the Low Countries, since his early paintings reveal the influence of the Antwerp school and chiefly the work of Frans Pourbus the Elder."
1955,"GHERARDI, Antonio","(b. 1638, Rieti, d. 1702, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect. Originally Antonio Tatoti, he changed his surname only after his arrival in Rome c. 1656. With the help of his first patron, Bulgarino Bulgarini, he was able eventually to study with Pier Francesco Mola and Pietro da Cortona, in whose studio he presumably received his training as both painter and architect.



"
1956,"GHERARDI, Cristofano","(b. 1508, Borgo San Sepolcro, d. 1556, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardj/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In 1529, after studying with Raffaello dal Colle, he went to Florence, where he became one of Vasari's most steadfast followers. His figurative training provided him with a minute, analytical language, which he often grafted on to Vasari's compositional schemes to produce an effect of refined elegance. His works bear the stamp of the Tuscan-Roman Mannerism of Giulio Romano, Perino del Vaga and Francesco Salviati, not to mention its originators Michelangelo and Raphael."
1957,"GHERARDI, Filippo","(b. 1643, Lucca, d. 1704, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardk/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His career is inextricably linked to that of Giovanni Coli, with whom he collaborated until Coli's death in 1681. The phases of their training and careers are identical. He studied first with his father Sebastiano Gherardi, then with the Lucchese artist Pietro Paolini, and later, and most importantly, in the Roman workshop of Pietro da Cortona."
1958,"GHERARDINI, Tommaso","(b. 1715, Firenze, d. 1797, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardl/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Vincenzo Meucci in Florence. He was much appreciated by the Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo for his neoclassicist taste. In particular he introduced into Florence new types of decoration, the so-called Pompeian style and the fake bas-relief. From the 1740s he participated in the decoration of villas and palaces in Florence and its environment."
1959,"GHERARDINI, Alessandro","(b. 1655, Firenze, d. 1723, Livorno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardm/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active mainly in Florence. He was the pupil of Alessandro Rosi. In Florence, he decorated many church interiors and palaces with frescoes and large paintings, but he worked also in several other cities like Livorno and Genoa.

1960,GHERARDO DI GIOVANNI DEL FORA,"(b. ca. 1445, Firenze, d. 1497, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardo/biograph.html,"
Gherardo di Giovanni di Miniato del Fora, Italian illuminator and painter, member of a family of artists. The sculptor Giovanni Miniato (1398-1479), a collaborator of Donatello, had three sons who were active in Florence as artists: Bartolomeo di Giovanni (di Miniato) del Fora (1442-1494), Gherardo di Giovanni (di Miniato) del Fora and Monte di Giovanni (di Miniato) del Fora (1448-1533). The three brothers maintained a book workshop together from 1465 and continued to work together until 1476, when Bartolomeo left, seemingly for financial reasons. Since Gherardo and Monte often collaborated, their work is sometimes difficult to distinguish with complete confidence. Both were familiar with contemporary painting, but they had different interests. Gherardo was sensitive to an ordered arrangement of figures in space; he preferred his portraits to be inscrutable, and he liked to reproduce contemporary Florentine architecture faithfully. Monte's urban views, by comparison, were more imaginative and his portraits more expressive."
1961,"GHERARDUCCI, Don Silvestro dei","(b. 1339, Firenze, d. 1399, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gherardu/biograph.html,"

Italian illuminator. He joined the Camaldolese order at the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence in 1348 at the tender age of nine. He professed his vows at the age of thirteen, after a four-year novitiate. He became Prior in 1398. The importance of the scriptorium was noted by Vasari in his Vita of Lorenzo Monaco; the latter's entry into the monastery in 1391 completed a triumvirate of painters, Don Silvestro, the eldest painter in the group, Don Simone Camaldolese and Don Lorenzo, that constituted the most important late medieval school of painters in Florence."
1962,"GHERINGH, Anton Ghunther","(d. 1668, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gheringh/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp. He specialized in architectural church interiors.

1967,"GHIRLANDAIO, Davide","(b. 1452, Firenze, d. 1525, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghirland/davide/biograph.html,"
Painter and mosaicist, brother of Domenico Ghirlandaio. Most of his professional career was linked to that of his brother. His date of birth is recorded in the baptismal records of Florence Cathedral, and in 1472 he is listed with Domenico in the Libro rosso of the Compagnia di S Luca. On 3 January 1472 he was admitted to the confraternity of S Paolo. His collaboration with Domenico is documented from 1480, when he is listed in his father's tax declaration as being 29 years old and described as Domenico's 'aiuto', but a precise definition of his role as assistant is unclear. Suggestions range from considering him a financial adviser (the source of which is an anecdote in Vasari) to an alter ego of his brother."
1968,"GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico","(b. 1449, Firenze, d. 1494, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghirland/domenico/biograph.html,"
Ghirlandaio (original name Domenico di Tommaso Bighordi) was an early Renaissance painter of the Florentine school noted for his detailed narrative frescoes, which include many portraits of leading citizens in contemporary dress."
1969,"GHIRLANDAIO, Ridolfo","(b. 1483, Firenze, d. 1525, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghirland/ridolfo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, son of Domenico Ghirlandaio. He probably learnt his craft from his father and remained with his uncle Davide Ghirlandaio when the latter took over the workshop in 1494. Ridolfo’s first documented work is the Virgin of the Sacred Girdle (1509; Prato Cathedral), which was commissioned in 1507 from Davide and Ridolfo but probably mostly painted by the latter. The upper part still shows Domenico’s influence, whereas the lower section reflects, somewhat clumsily, the more modern style of Fra Bartolommeo, with whom Ridolfo studied, according to Vasari. An interest in Piero di Cosimo is also apparent in the use of light and the sometimes disquieting landscapes of the earlier works that may be attributed to Ridolfo with certainty. This is particularly evident in SS Peter and Paul (Florence, Pitti), commissioned from Davide in 1503 but attributable to Ridolfo on the basis of style, the Virgin and Child between SS Francis and Mary Magdalene (1503; Florence, Accademia) and the Coronation of the Virgin (1504; Paris, Louvre), which was inspired by Domenico’s altarpiece of the same subject (1484–86; Narni, Pinacoteca Comunale). Another very interesting work that may be dated to the first decade of the 16th century is the Procession to Calvary (London, National Gallery), which shows signs of Ridolfo’s study of Leonardo’s lost cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari.


"
1970,"GHISI, Giorgio","(b. 1520, Mantova, d. 1582, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghisi/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver. His teacher was probably Giovanni Battista Scultori, after whose designs and in whose style he engraved two Scenes from the Trojan War. His six earliest prints, from the early 1540s or before, are after designs by Giulio Romano. They are lightly engraved in rather flat perspective, the figures often silhouetted against dark backgrounds, the shading lines not necessarily defining volume, and with an effect of intense flickering light, in the style of Scultori."
1971,"GHISLANDI, Vittore","(b. 1655, Bergamo, d. 1743, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghisland/biograph.html,"
Giuseppe Ghislandi, called Fra Vittore Galgario, was an Italian portrait painter, active mainly in Bergamo, who was trained in Venice and whose portraits reflect the best qualities of Late Baroque Venetian painting in their solid handling and strong but subdued colour. His sitters are usually simple people and he represents them in informal poses, often with a strength of light and shade indicating a knowledge of Rembrandt. He has lately been connected  with Realist tendency in Lombard painting of the early 18th century, but the closest parallels among his contemporaries seem to be Hogarth's portraits, although his best-known work, the Boy Painter (Bergamo), in some ways anticipates Greuze.


"
1972,"GHISOLFI, Giovanni","(b. 1623, Milano, d. 1683, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghisolfi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born in Milan, he initially trained with his uncle, Antonio Volpino. At the age of 17, he travelled to Rome with his friend Antonio Busca (1625-1684) where he painted vedute and capricci, mainly landscapes with architectural fragments and ruins."
1973,"GHISSI, Francescuccio",(active 1359-1395),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/ghissi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the leading 14th-century painter from the Marches after Allegretto Nuzi, with whom he collaborated. The overall pattern of his activity is unknown. Most of his surviving panels depict the Madonna of Humility. Frescoes in S Francesco in Sanseverino were recorded but are now lost. Between his earliest known work, the signed Madonna of Humility (1359; Fabriano, S Domenico), and the Madonna of Humility with an Angel (1374; Montegiorgio, S Andrea) his draughtsmanship and facial modelling became more assured and the design of the basic triangular group more elegant. Another example (Fermo, S Domenico) shows the richness of his decorative repertory in the painted cloth and in the elaborately foliated gold ground."

"
1975,"GIAMBONO, Michele",(known 1420-1462 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giambono/biograph.html,"Italian painter (Michele di Taddeo di Giovanni Bono). He was heir to the Late Gothic style as practised in Venice, and his art represents the most complete development of that style by a Venetian painter. He was seemingly not interested in the forms of antique art and did not seek the kind of verisimilitude practised by such fully Renaissance artists as Giovanni Bellini. His style remained Gothic, as did his vision, but he created unusual combinations of images that anticipate the novel kind of subject-matter later used by Giovanni Bellini. Until the mid-19th century he was known primarily for his designs for the mosaics in the Mascoli Chapel, S Marco, Venice, but he is now also recognized as an accomplished panel painter.



"
1976,GIAMPIETRINO,(active 1520-40 in Milan),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giampiet/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, his real name: Giovanni Pietro Rizzoli. He may be identifiable with the 'gian petro' jotted down in a list by Leonardo between 1497 and 1500 (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Codex Atlanticus) and thus may have been present in or near Leonardo's Milanese workshop before the end of the 15th century, although the surviving paintings usually connected with him belong stylistically to the period between 1510 and 1530. The recent discovery of documents and paintings related to his presence in Savona in 1537 excludes the previous identifications of the artists with Giovanni Pedrini or Pietro Rizzo."

Italian painter, active mainly in Perugia. He was also called (erroneously) Giannicola di Paolo Manni. The artist was employed in the workshop of Perugino, with whom he collaborated on numerous works, including the Last Supper in the church of Sant'Onofrio, Florence. Later as an independent painter he set up a workshop in Piazza del Sopramura, the same square occupied by that of his former master, and his style remained heavily influenced by Perugino throughout his career."
1979,"GIAQUINTO, Corrado","(b. 1703, Molfetta, d. 1766, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giaquint/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was apprenticed to Nicola Maria Rossi, then to Solimena. His spiritual master, however, was undoubtedly Luca Giordano. By the 1740s Giaquinto was the leading exponent of the Rococo school that flourished in Rome during the first half of the 18th century. Later he established himself as Europe's foremost fresco painter after Giambattista Tiepolo."

1981,"GIBSON, John","(b. 1790, Conway, d. 1866, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gibson/biograph.html,"
English sculptor. He worked in Rome and was the central figure of the Anglo-Roman school and one of the leading exponents of Neoclassicism in the 19th century. He had English, American and Italian patrons and was honoured by academies throughout Europe. Two of his brothers, Solomon Gibson (c. 1796-1886) and Benjamin Gibson (1811-51), were also sculptors.

He was an established portrait painter by 1711, when he was appointed a founding director of Godfrey Kneller's Academy in London; among his pupils there was George Vertue. Gibson's sitters included a number of important public figures: Dr Henry Sacheverell (1710; Oxford, Magdalen College), John Flamsteed (1712; Oxford, Bodleian Library), Sir Robert Walpole (untraced), Archbishop William Wake (Oxford, Christ Church Picture Gallery) and Archbishop John Potter (London, Lambeth Palace). His most constant patron was John, 1st Earl Poulett (1663-1743), who commissioned a great number of originals and copies."
1983,"GIFFART, Pierre","(b. 1643, Paris, d. 1723, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giffart/biograph.html,"

"
1984,"GIGANTE, Giacinto","(b. 1806, Napoli, d. 1876, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gigante/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. Born in Naples, he began his apprenticeship around 1818 with his father Gaetano. In 1820, together with Achille Vianelli, he joined the studio of German artist, Jakob Wilhelm Huber (1787-1871), where he began to learn use of the 'camera lucida' to produce panoramic frames around the focal point. In the same period, he was employed by the royal printing office, Real Officio Topografico, where he learned acid etching and lithography techniques. Between 1822 and 1824 he frequented the landscape art school of Pitloo, and became his best student. Pitloo's innovations involved the young Neapolitan artists, those who later became founder members of the Posillipo School. Artists who learned from the maestro a method such as en plein air, the love of research into locations and different panoramic perspectives, the affirmation of a romantic interpretation of a landscape with full freedom of artistic impression. This was the framework common to artists of the Posillipo School, not the theme of their paintings. Unlike the maestro, however, Gigante always moved with respect to the panorama, preferring acid techniques, later lightened with touches of tempera or white lead."
1985,"GIGOLA, Giambattista","(b. 1769, Brescia, d. 1841, Tremezzo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gigola/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Battista Gigola (or Cigola), Italian miniaturist and portraitist. He commenced his studies in Italy; in c. 1800 he traveled to Paris, where he joined the studio of Isabey. He may have participated in several exhibitions in Paris beginning from 1803. Sometime later he returned to Milan, where he was a protégé of the viceroy Eugène, Duke of Leuchtenberg (Eugène de Beauharnais). Besides miniatures on ivory, Gigola also painted on enamel. In fact, he is considered the artist who reintroduced this technique to Italy. He also drew illustrations for Byron and Lodovico da Porto. His miniatures show no influence of his master Isabey, they are of a typical Italian technique, with slightly dull colouring and the backgrounds painted in gouache.

Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts (Gysbrechts) was a Flemish painter. He became free master in Antwerp in 1659/60. He worked most notably for the Danish court, where he was Court Painter 1670-72 in Copenhagen. He specialized in trompe-l'oeil or illusionistic paintings.

1988,"GIJSELS, Pieter","(b. 1621, Antwerpen, d. 1690, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gijsels/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter (also spelt Gysels). He began his training in 1641, when he was already 20, with Antwerp painter Jan Boots. Houbraken assumed he was also apprenticed to Jan Brueghel the Younger, whose diary describes a painting completed in 1638 as a 'small wild boar somewhat touched up by Gys'. But it seems highly doubtful that, as van der Sanden claimed, 'Gys' refers to Pieter Gysels. In 1649 or 1650 he became a master in Antwerp's Guild of St Luke. It is not known whether he took on any pupils. On 13 November 1650 he married Joanna Huybrecht, who bore him six children.

Spanish architect, part of a family of architects, illegitimate son of Juan Gil de Hontañón the Elder. Rodrigo was the most prolific architect of his time in Castile, whether in providing plans, directing operations or giving information about them. In the first phase of his career he followed the Hispano-Flemish style of his father, but from c. 1533 he introduced Italian Renaissance forms, particularly in his civil architecture, which led to his becoming Master of the Works at the cathedrals of Segovia, Palencia, Plasencia and Astorga, Master Mason at the New Cathedral of Salamanca and the most prominent architect of the Spanish Renaissance."
1991,"GILLEMANS, Jan Pauwel the Elder","(b. 1618, Antwerpen, d. 1675, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gilleman/elder/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Although born in Antwerp, he was initially trained in Liège as a goldsmith by a family member. It is not known when he took up painting, who trained him as an artist, or when he returned to Antwerp. It is quite possible that he received at least part of his tuition from Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Gillemans' entire oeuvre consists of still-lifes, many of which show a substantial influence of that great master of still-life painting, particularly early on. Gillemans was accepted as a master in his own right by the Antwerp painters' guild in 1647 or 1648, when he was about 30 years old."
1992,"GILLEMANS, Jan Pauwel the Younger","(b. 1651, Antwerpen, d. 1704, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gilleman/younger/biograph.html,"

In 1573/74 he became a master with the Antwerp guild of St Luke. The political instability in the Southern Netherlands caused by the friction between the suppressing Spanish and the rise of Protestantism must have prompted Jan Pauwel Gillemans to move up North. From 1700 to 1702, he was recorded as fijnschilder in the guild of Middelburg. However, Gillemans did not settle there permanently, the years before his death around 1704 he resided in Amsterdam."
1993,"GILLIS, Nicolaes",(active 1610-1630 in Haarlem),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gillis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, born in Antwerp. He moved with his parents to Haarlem, where he was documented between 1610 and 1631. In 1635 he married there Tanneken Abeel from Bruges. Only a few paintings by him survived, mostly banquet pieces (banketje or ontbijtje) painted in a style close to that of Floris van Dijck. Floris van Dijck and Nicolaes Gillis exerted a strong influence on the following generation of painters.

French painter, draughtsman, and etcher. Few of his paintings survive, but his predilection for scenes from the 'commedia dell'arte' was inherited by his pupil Watteau. His work survive mainly in the form of drawings and etchings, and he excelled at designs in the elegant Rococo manner of Audran.

He spent a year at the University of Oxford, but left on account of his health to work as a tutor with an English family in Odessa. On his return in 1896 he attended Hastings School of Art and then the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1897-1901). Afterwards he spent over a year in Spain, copying paintings by Velázquez in the Prado. He traveled in Norway. He also married an American painter, Grace Canedy, whom he met in Madrid. They settled in London, but after the birth of a daughter made a long visit to Canedy's family in Chicago where a second daughter was born and Gilman came under pressure to join his father-in-law's business."

English painter, watercolourist and etcher, part of a family of artists, brother of William Gilpin. After initial artistic tuition from his father, he was apprenticed in London in 1749 to the marine painter Samuel Scott and remained with him for almost nine years. No extant marines can be confidently ascribed to Gilpin alone, though he is thought to have assisted Scott in the execution of some commissions during the 1750s. During this period Gilpin's sketches of horses and carts in Covent Garden reportedly brought him to the attention of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, by whom he was briefly employed around 1759. His watercolour studies made at Cumberland's stud-farm have been compared (and sometimes confused) with those of his fellow-employee Paul Sandby."

Italian sculptor and architect. Gian Lorenzo Bernini - in his maturity and during his later years when he worked mainly for churches - was surrounded by assistants of distinction. One of them was Antonio Giorgetti who spent his entire career in Rome. His most prominent sculpture is the Angel with the Sponge on the Ponte Sant'Angelo, where he was working under the direction of Bernini, who provided sketches and in some instances bozzetti for the angels. For Borromini's Capella Spada in the church of San Girolamo della Carità (1660), Giorgetti provided the two kneeling angels that hold up the jasper draperies that serve as a balustrade to the altar. By January 1660, Giorgetti was sufficiently closely linked to Cardinal Francesco Barberini to be referred to in several Barberini accounts as ""nostro scultore."""
2007,"GIORGETTI, Giuseppe",(doc. 1668-1682 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giorgett/giuseppe/biograph.html,"

He was granted citizenship of Ferrara in 1462. His earliest documented works were executed in Ferrara, where in 1445-48 he participated in the decoration of a Breviary for Lionello d'Este (dismembered, private collection). His illuminations for a Missal for Borso d'Este (Ms. lat. 239, Biblioteca Estense, Modena) were executed between 1449 and 1457."

He was ranked by Vasari with Leonardo da Vinci as one of the founders of modern painting. He was the first exponent in Venice of the small picture in oils, intended for private collectors rather than for churches, and frequently mysterious and evocative in subject. Giorgione's achievement in transforming the character of Venetian painting has always seemed the more remarkable in a life, terminated by the plague of 1510, that was even shorter than Raphael 's. Our knowledge of his career is confined to a few contemporary references, from the years 1506-10, and only a handful of paintings are undisputedly attributed to him, including the Castelfranco Altarpiece (in the church of San Liberate in the town of his birth), the portrait of Laura and The Three Philosophers (Vienna), and the Tempest (Venice, Accademia).

Remigio Deposition in Florence (Uffizi) which was regarded as a work of Maso di Banco by Vasari and earlier writers. The distinction of hand is evident, but it is by no means certain that Giottino was identical with a Giotto di Maestro Stefano who was painting in the Vatican in 1369, who in turn cannot be reconciled with Vasari's Maso/Giottino figure. No other work can reasonably be attributed to the painter of the Uffizi Deposition, unless one accepts the attribution of it to Orcagna's brother Nardo di Cione.

2011,GIOTTO di Bondone,"(b. 1267, Vespignano, d. 1337, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giotto/biograph.html,"Florentine painter and architect. He was already recognized by Dante as the leading artist of his day. His significance to the Renaissance can be gauged from the fact that not only the leaders in the early 15th-century transformation of the arts, such as Masaccio, but the key figures of the High Renaissance, such as Raphael and Michelangelo - one of whose early studies of Giotto's frescoes in the Peruzzi Chapel, Santa Croce, has survived - were still learning from him and partly founding their style on his example. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, his art is notable for its clear, grave, simple solutions to the basic problems of the representation of space and of the volume, structure, and solidity of 3-dimensional forms, and above all of the human figure. Secondly, he was a genius at getting to the heart of whatever episode from sacred history he was representing, at cutting it down to its essential, dramatic core, and at finding the compositional means to express its innermost spiritual meaning and its psychological effects in terms of simple areas of paint. His solutions to many of the problems of dramatic narrative were fundamental. They have subsequently been elaborated on in many ways, but they have never been surpassed.

2012,"GIOVANETTI, Matteo","(b. ca. 1300, Viterbo, d. ca. 1368, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanet/biograph.html,"
Matteo Giovanetti da Viterbo (also Gianetti), Italian painter. His name first appears in papal letters of 1322 and 1328 in relation to his duties as a priest in S Luca in Viterbo, north of Rome. In 1336 Pope Benedict XII (reg 1334-42) appointed him prior of S Martino in Viterbo, and in 1348 he was nominated as archprior of Verceil in Provence. All his surviving work as a painter was done in and around Avignon, the seat of the papacy from 1309 to 1377. He worked on the decoration of the papal palace, both in collaboration with other artists and on his own in the St Martial Chapel. His slightly fussy, calligraphic style reached the height of its expressive freedom in the frescoes for Innocent VI at the Villeneuve-les-Avignon monastery (c. 1355). He also worked in Rome as painter to Urban V."
2013,GIOVANNI D'AGOSTINO,"(b. 1311, Siena, d. ca. 1348, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/agostino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, son of Agostino di Giovanni, a sculptor in Siena. Like his father, he was continuously active in architecture as well as in sculpture. His documented career runs from 1332, when he was working in the Pieve at Arezzo, to a final mention in 1347. It includes a period as capomaestro, firstly of the Duomo of Orvieto, and secondly that of Siena (1340-45). His one surviving signed work is a small high relief of the Madonna and Child with Angels in the Oratory of S. Bernardino in Siena. The only other important work attributable to him is the hexagonal font for S. Maria del Pieve in Arezzo.



"
2014,GIOVANNI D’ALEMAGNA,"(active 1441, d. 1450, Venice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/alemagna/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Italy. He collaborated with Antonio Vivarini on various important religious paintings in Venice and Padua. Although it is difficult to distinguish the two artists' contributions, Giovanni is associated with the St Jerome (1444; Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery), which carries the signature 'Johannes'. This painting suggests that Giovanni's work was generally flatter and more decorative than Antonio's more naturalistic style.



"
2015,GIOVANNI D'AMBROGIO,(active 1382-1418 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/ambrogio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. He is not to be identified with the craftsman of the same name who was employed to construct the piers of Florence Cathedral in 1366. Giovanni d'Ambrogio's work provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of Renaissance sculpture; he has been described as the 'true mentor of Donatello, and even more so of Nanni di Banco.



"
2016,GIOVANNI and PACIO DA FIRENZE,(documented 1343-1345),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/andpacio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor brothers, mentioned in documents of 1343-45. Following Tino di Camaino to Naples after 1323, they adopted his courtly manner and became the main representatives of his style after his death in 1337. Their only documented work is the large tomb of Robert the Wise of Anjou, king of Naples (r. 1309-1343), erected in the church of Santa Chiara, Naples, between 1343 and 1345."
2017,GIOVANNI ANGELO D'ANTONIO,(documented 1443-1476),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/angelo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter from Camerino. He worked in association with Girolamo di Giovanni da Camerino and was in fact responsible for much of the oeuvre assigned to the latter. 

"
2018,GIOVANNI ANTONIO DA BRESCIA,"(b. ca. 1460, Brescia, d. 1523, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/antonio/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Antonio da Brescia was an Italian engraver. He is identified with the printmaker formerly known as Zoan Andrea. He is undocumented, but active from the 1490s in north Italy, and from c.1509 in Rome where he is active until at least 1519."
2019,GIOVANNI DI BALDUCCIO,(active 1315-1349),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/balducci/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He is first documented in 1317-18 in the cathedral workshop in Pisa, where he was being paid a modest daily wage. In 1349 he was asked, while living in Milan, to take charge of the cathedral works in Pisa, but he was still resident in Milan towards the end of 1349, and he may have died there soon afterwards. His style is known from four signed works, which have formed the basis for a reconstruction of his oeuvre: the tomb of Guarniero degli Antelminelli (c. 1327-28) in San Francesco, Sarzana; the pulpit in Santa Maria del Prato in San Casciano, near Florence; the shrine of St Peter Martyr (dated 1339) in Sant'Eustorgio, Milan; and the architrave (1347) from the main portal of Santa Maria di Brera, Milan (fragments in Castello Sforzesco, Milan)."
2020,GIOVANNI DI BARTOLOMEO CRISTIANI,"(b. ca. 1340, Pistoia, d. ca. 1398, Pistoia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Little remains of the work of this master, active in his native Pistoia and Florence. Our knowledge of his style is based on three signed pictures, the St John altarpiece, dated 1370, in the church of San Giovanni Fuorcivitas in Pistoia, a Madonna in the Pistoia Gallery, and a triptych dated 1390, in a private collection. These paintings and a few that have been attributed to him on the basis of style show that he was strongly influenced by Andrea Orcagna's brother, Nardo di Cione. His rigorously balanced and often symmetrical compositions, along with the sharp outlines of his figures, show that he knew the paintings of Maso di Banco, who is known to have worked in Pistoia.



"
2021,GIOVANNI DEL BIONDO,(active 1356-1392 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/biondo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In 1356 he was granted Florentine citizenship as 'Iohannes Biondi de Casentino pictor'. Tax records show that he was resident in Florence from 1359 until his death, when his relatives assumed responsibility for his tax liabilities. The early sources, including Ghiberti and Vasari, do not mention him at all, despite the fact that he seems to have been extremely prolific, as a large number of his works survive. Only two of these are signed and dated: a small panel of the Virgin and Child (1377; Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale), and the altarpiece (1392) for S Francesco Figline Valdarno. He was paid for this work in 1391, and the central panel with the Virgin and Child survives. A 17th-century source records another altarpiece (untraced) painted for S Sofia in Castelfiorentino, which bore the artist's name and the date 1360. His style is sufficiently distinctive, however, for a significant number of works to be ascribed to him with confidence. Since several of these are dated, his development can be followed fairly closely.



"
2022,GIOVANNI da Bologna,(active 1370-1390),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/bolognax/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Documented in Treviso from 1377 to 1383, and in Venice from 1385 to 1389, he completed altarpieces and polyptychs in the manner of Lorenzo Veneziano. Inspired by the new ideas of Altichiero, he strove to construct a more rational spatiality, incorporating elements of realism.



"
2023,GIOVANNI DA CAMPIONE,"(b. ca. 1320, Campione, d. ca. 1375, Campione)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/campione/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, son of the sculptor Ugo da Campione (d. ca. 1360). He studied in the workshop of his father in Bergamo. He is first mentioned in a document of 1348 working as a sculptor in the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso in Bellano. Then in Bergamo, he worked on the sculptural decoration of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore and the Baptistery. Here he executed the north portal in 1351 (with the ""red lion"") and the south portal in 1360 (with the ""white lions""). In the Baptistery, he was assisted by his sons Nicolino and Cristofore. He is last mentioned in Bergamo in 1367, when he was paid for the portals.



"
2024,GIOVANNI DI FRANCESCO DEL CERVELLIERA,"(b. 1412, Firenze, d. 1459, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/frances/biograph.html,"
Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera da Rovezzano, Italian painter. His date of birth is deduced from an entry in the catasto (land registry declaration) of 1435, in which the artist gave his age as 23. Toesca first identified Giovanni di Francesco as the author of a group of works previously attributed to the Master of the Carrand Triptych, who was named after the triptych formerly in the Carrand collection, of the Virgin and Child with Sts Francis, John the Baptist, Nicholas and Peter (Florence, Museo Nazionale del Bargello), from San Niccolò, Florence. The scenes from the Life of St Nicholas (Florence, Casa Buonarroti) probably formed the predella. The identification was based on a document relating to a payment for the fresco of God the Father with the Holy Innocents over the door of the church of the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence (1458-59; in situ)."
2025,GIOVANNI DI FRANCESCO DI PIERO,"(b. ca. 1425, Firenze, d. after 1498)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/frances1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, pupil of Andrea del Castagno, documented until 1498 in Florence. A few paintings formerly attributed to Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera, among them the so-called Carrand triptych, are now given to this painter. There is a confusion in the literature regarding the works by the two painters, both named Giovanni di Francesco.



"
2026,GIOVANNI FRANCESCO DA RIMINI,"(b. ca. 1420, Rimini, d. ca. 1470, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/francesc/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Francesco da Rimini was an Italian painter active in Rimini. He was probably an assistant to Matteo di Gualdo, and he was influenced by Giovanni Boccati and Benedetto Bonfigli.



"
2027,GIOVANNI AGOSTINO DA LODI,(active c. 1467–1524),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/lodi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman (also known as Pseudo-Boccaccino). The identification of a particular hand has resulted in the removal of a group of paintings from those formerly attributed to Boccaccio Boccaccino of Cremona (whence the name 'Pseudo-Boccaccino'). This resulted from the discovery of the signature of Giovanni Agostino da Lodi on a small panel painting of SS Peter and John (c. 1495; Milan, Brera) and was confirmed by another on a drawing, Allegory of Prudence (private collection). These works suggest that he was an intermediary between the perspective art of Lombardy during the last decade of the 15th century and the Venetian style of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and the other painters of their circle. A lengthy stay in Venice is attested by a payment made in 1504 and by the presence of important paintings in the Veneto, such as the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Saints (Murano, S Pietro Martire), Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples (1500; Venice, Gallerie dell'Accademia) and the Virgin and Child with SS Roch and Nicholas (Bribano, S Nicola), in which his style was enriched by elements inspired by Dürer. His career thus appears to have run parallel with Girolamo Romanino, Altobello Melone and those artists whose works reveal a fusion of Milanese, Venetian and northern European influences."
2028,GIOVANNI DA MILANO,"(active 1350-69, Milano, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/milano/biograph.html,"

Italian painter, originally Giovanni di Jacopo di Guido da Caversaccio. He came from Lombardy and is first recorded in Florence on 17 October 1346, listed as Johannes Jacobi de Commo among the foreign painters living in Florence. There follows a gap of at least 12 undocumented years until his inscription as Johannes Jacobi Guidonis de Mediolano with the Arte dei Medici e Speziali between 1358 and 1363. A tax return dated 26 December 1363 declares his ownership of land in Ripoli, Tizzana (nr Prato) and a house in the parish of S Pier Maggiore, Florence. A document from 1365 reveals a contract with him for painting the frescoes in the Rinuccini Chapel in Santa Croce, Florence. In 1369, he is documented in Rome working on a commission from Pope Urban V to decorate two chapels in the Vatican Palace that are no longer extant. This is the last time that he is mentioned in documents."
2029,GIOVANNI DA MODENA,(active 1409-1456 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/modena/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is first recorded in Bologna in 1409; the following year he was paid for the hangings for an important funeral in San Francesco, Bologna. His major surviving work is the fresco decoration of the Bolognini Chapel in San Petronio, Bologna, commissioned in Bartolomeo Bolognini's will of 1408. It is attributed to Giovanni on the basis of his later work (1420-21) in the neighbouring chapel of S Abbondio. Bolognini stipulated that there should be a Paradise, in which Giovanni shows rows of saints seated on benches, contemplating the Coronation of the Virgin, an Inferno 'as horrible as possible' and a Journey of the Magi. On the altar wall Giovanni, assisted by Jacopo di Paolo (who painted the altarpiece and stained glass), depicted the Legend of St Petronius, bishop and protector of Bologna. The fresco of the installation of a bishop (perhaps Giovanni di Michele of Bologna, reg 1412-17) by the anti-pope John XXIII suggests a dating of c. 1412-20. The Petronius scenes are set against details of Bologna's townscape; the embarkation and papal scenes recall illuminations of Bolognese shipping law and canon law manuscripts respectively. The hollow-cheeked faces and dark shadows probably show the influence and assistance of Jacopo di Paolo."
2030,GIOVANNI DI NICOLA DA PISA,"(doc. 1326, d. ca. 1364)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/nicola/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was active mainly in his native Pisa, but was heavily influenced by Sienese painting. He was a pupil of Lippo Memmi, the brother-in-law of Simone Martini, who is documented as working in Pisa in 1325, and may at that date taken on Giovanni di Nicola as a pupil."
2031,GIOVANNI DA ORIOLO,"(b. Oriolo, nr Faenza, active 1439, d. ca. 1474, Faenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/oriolo/biograph.html,"
Giovanni da Oriolo (also Giovanni da Faenza), Italian painter. His oeuvre is known through one painting, the signed profile portrait of Lionello d'Este (National Gallery, London). Stylistically similar to Pisanello's Portrait of Lionello d'Este (c. 1444; Accademia Carrara, Bergamo), Giovanni's painting probably dates to the same period or slightly later. There is a payment to 'Magistro Johanni de Faventia' dated 21 June 1447, which may refer to the portrait."
2032,GIOVANNI di Paolo,"(b. ca. 1403, Siena, d. 1483, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/paolo/biograph.html,"
Giovanni di Paolo di Grazia, one of the most important Italian painters of the 15th-century Sienese school. He is chiefly notable for carrying the brilliantly colourful vision of Sienese 14th-century paintings on into the Renaissance. His early works show the influence of previous Sienese masters, his landscapes and his figures still reverberate with echoes of Duccio's work, but his later style grew steadily more individualized, characterized by vigorous, harsh colors and elongated forms. His art most beautifully reflects the 15th-century artistic conservatism of a commercially declining city."
2033,GIOVANNI DI PIAMONTE,(active 1456-1472),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/piamonte/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The date and place of his birth are not known, but his name indicates that he was born in Piamonte near present Pontassieve in Tuscany."
2034,GIOVANNI DI PIETRO,"(d. 1528, Spoleto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/pietro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Lo Spagna. He got his nickname because he was born in Spain. The circumstances in which he moved to Italy are unknown. He was first documented in the Florentine workshop of Perugino in 1492, at which point he seems to have been a very young assistant. He is documented in Spello in 1502, and could have worked as an assistant to Pinturicchio there."
2035,GIOVANNI DAL PONTE,"(b. 1385, Firenze, d. ca. 1438, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/ponte/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Giovanni di Marco. Together with his assistant, Smeraldo di Giovanni, Giovanni dal Ponte trained under Buffalmaco. Towards the end of his creative period, he was typical of the fusion of the late Gothic style with elements of the Early Renaissance.



"
2036,GIOVANNI DA RIMINI,(active 1292-1336 in Rimini),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/rimini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Legal documents mention a Giovanni 'painter', then 'master', living in Rimini between 1292 and 1336. It is likely that they refer to the artist identified on the basis of the Crucifix (Mercatello, San Francesco), inscribed JOHES PICTOR FECIT HOC OPUS/FR. TOBALDI and dated 1309 or 1314; the earlier date is largely accepted today.



"
2037,GIOVANNI DA SAN GIOVANNI,"(b. 1592, San Giovanni Valdarno, d. 1636, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/sangiova/biograph.html,"
Giovanni da San Giovanni (Giovanni Mannozzi), Italian painter and draughtsman. He was the most distinguished of the artists working in fresco in 17th-century Florence. An eccentric personality, he was attracted by the charm and informality of northern art and by a satirical approach to classical themes."
2038,GIOVANNI DI SIMONE,(active 1260-1284 in Pisa),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/simone/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He is credited with the design of the Campo Santo and the church of San Francesco, both in Pisa. He died in 1284, when Pisa suffered a defeat in the naval battle of Meloria against the Genoans.



"
2039,GIOVANNI DI TURINO,"(b. ca. 1384, Siena, d. ca. 1455, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/turino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active in Siena. He was one of the sculptors, including Lorenzo Ghiberti, Donatello and Jacopo della Quercia, who worked in the Baptistery of Siena between 1417 and 1431 on the baptismal font made of marble, bronze, and enamel.



"
2040,GIOVANNI DA UDINE,"(b. 1487, Udine, d. 1564, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/udine/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, stuccoist, and architect (full name: Giovanni di Nanni da Udine). He was one of Raphael's leading assistants in Rome and is chiefly important for his role in reviving antique techniques of stucco and the ancient taste for grotesques, inspired by archaeological discoveries. In 1502 he was apprenticed to Giovanni Martini (also called Giovanni da Udine; d 1535), a painter in Udine, and subsequently he may have studied with Giorgione in Venice. In Rome, he joined Raphael's workshop, where he may have learnt techniques of still-life painting from a Netherlandish colleague. In 1522 he returned to Udine; he spent most of the rest of his life there, but he had further sojourns in Rome (where he died) and also worked in Florence and Venice."
2041,"GIOVANNI DA VERONA, Fra","(b. ca. 1457, d. ca. 1525, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giovanni/verona/biograph.html,"
Italian intarsia artist. He entered the Olivetan Order at Monte Oliveto Maggiore near Siena in 1476, and after ordination (1477-79) he was sent to the monastery of San Giorgio, Ferrara, where he learnt the art of wood inlay from Fra Sebastiano da Rovigno, called 'Schiavone'. Giovanni then worked as a wood-carver in Perugia (1480-84)."
2042,"GIRALDI, Guglielmo",(active 1445–1489),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giraldi/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. The son of a tailor, Giovanni Giraldi is documented continuously in Ferrara from 1445 to 1477. With Taddeo Crivelli, he was the favourite illuminator of Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and the Gonzaga of Mantua. and one of the most important Ferrarese personalities in Renaissance book decoration."
2043,"GIRARD, Dominique",(1680-1738),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girard/biograph.html,"
French landscape architect. He was a garden designer and water engineer, the pupil of André Le Nôtre. He was active in Germany and Austria. He created 
the formal garden of terraces, parterres, and a large pool in the Belvedere gardens in Vienna. He designed also the magnificent park of Schloss Augustusburg, Brühl."
2044,"GIRARDON, Francois","(b. 1628, Troyes, d. 1715, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girardon/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, famous exponent of classicism who worked for Louis XIV at Versailles. His most famous sculptures there are Apollo Tended by Nymphs (begun 1666; original grouping altered) in the grotto of Thetis, and Rape of Persephone (begun 1677) in the gardens. His other work includes the monument to Richelieu (1675-77).

"
2045,"GIRODET DE ROUCY-TRIOSON, Anne-Louis","(b. 1767, Montargis, d. 1824, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girodet/biograph.html,"
French painter and illustrator, usually known as Girodet-Trioson, a name he adopted in honour of a benefactor, Dr Trioson. He studied with Jacques-Louis David and won the Prix de Rome in 1789, returning to Paris in 1795. In style and technique he followed David, but for his choice of themes and his emotional treatment he was acclaimed by the young Romantics. He was particularly interested in unusual colour effects and in the problems of concentrated light and shade, as in The Sleep of Endymion (1792) and The Entombment of Atala (1808), both in the Louvre. Girodet often favoured literary themes, but he also won renown for his paintings glorifying Napoleon (The Revolt of Cairo, Versailles Museum, 1810) and was a fine portraitist. One of his best-known portraits, Mademoiselle Lange as Danae (Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 1799), caused a scandal because of its satirical sexual allusions."
2046,GIROLAMO DI BENVENUTO,"(b. 1470, Siena, d. 1524, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girolamo/benvenut/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, pupil and longtime collaborator of his father, Benvenuto di Giovanni. He asserted himself as an independent painter on 1498, completing the Assumption now on display in the museum at Montalcino. His secular work is particularly important, especially his birth trays (Hercules at the Crossroad, Galleria Franchetti, Ca' d'Oro, Venice).



"
2047,GIROLAMO DI GIOVANNI DA CAMERINO,(active 1449-1473),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girolamo/camerino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His first known painting is a fresco, dated 1449, of the Virgin and Child with Sts Anthony of Padua and Anthony Abbot (Camerino, Pinacoteca e Museo Civici). The influence of Piero della Francesca, who was active in Urbino during the late 1440s, is evident in the fresco's dramatic play of light and the geometric simplicity of its figures. On 21 November 1450 Girolamo entered the painters' guild in Padua. His hand was identified by Longhi in the frescoes of St Christopher and the King (destroyed in 1944) in the Ovetari Chapel in the Eremitani, Padua. His arrival in the city just after the death of Giovanni d'Alemagna and the withdrawal of Antonio Vivarini from the contract to decorate the chapel suggests that Girolamo went to Padua in order to apply for the new commission."
2048,GIROLAMO DA CREMONA,(active 1451-1483),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girolamo/cremona/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and painter, originally Girolamo di Giovanni dei Corradi, one of the most accomplished miniaturists of the fifteenth century. He probably trained in the circle of Francesco Squarcione in Padua. It is possible that Girolamo is the Gerolamo Padovano described as illuminating manuscripts for S Maria Nuova, Florence, in Vasari's Vita of Bartolomeo della Gatta. Girolamo's first known works are an historiated initial P showing the Baptism of Constantine (1451; Paris, Musée Marmottan) and a letter M inscribed Ieronimus. F. with St Catherine before Maxentius (London, Victoria and Albert Museum), both probably excised from the same Antiphonal. The style of these compositions is eclectic and includes figures with little articulation that appear to derive from Antonio Vivarini's types, combined with studied spatial effects probably learnt from Donatello's main altar at S Antonio, Padua. A subsequent but near contemporary work possibly by Girolamo is the miniature of St Maurice in the Life and Passion of St Maurice (1452/3; Paris, Bibliotheque Arsenal)."
2049,GIROLAMO DA FIESOLE,(active 1499-1507 in France),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girolamo/fiesole/biograph.html,"
Girolamo da Fiesole (Jérôme de Fiesole), Italian sculptor, active in France. A document of 1499 mentions him as the only sculptor employed by Anne of Brittany (1477-1514) to realize the tomb of her parents, Francis II, 10th Duke of Brittany and Marguerite of Foix (Nantes Cathedral), and also of her children by Charles VIII (Tours Cathedral). However, the recumbent effigies of the first tomb, which was designed by Jean Perréal, were executed by Michel Colombe between 1502 and 1507. It is possible that Jérôme was responsible for the decoration of the base of the monument with its white marble pilasters and shell-headed niches of red marble. It is believed that the design and execution of the decoration of the second tomb could be attributed to him with greater certainty. An Italian Renaissance repertory of ornament, exceptional in France in the early 16th century, appears on the sarcophagus, while the recumbent statues of the deceased are French in conception and style and come from the workshop of Colombe."
2050,GIROLAMO del Pacchia,"(b. 1477, Siena, d. after 1533, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/girolamo/pacchia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Siena, son of a metalsmith who specialized in weapons. His teacher was Giacomo Pacchiarotti from whom he took his name. By 1502 he and his master were Pinturicchio's assistants, decorating the ceiling of the Piccolomini Library in the Cathedral of Siena."

Girolamo da Treviso the Younger (originally Gerolamo Pennacchi), Italian painter, sculptor, and architect. He was active in Venice, Bologna, and from 1538 at the Court of Henry VIII in England. He died in the siege of Boulogne in 1544, where he was serving as a military engineer.

Italian gem-engraver, sculptor and medallist. He was one of the most important gem-engravers of the first half of the 19th century. In 1812 he was elected to the Accademia di San Luca in Rome as an engraver of hardstones and was awarded numerous prizes. On the command of Canova, he was employed by the Papal Mint from 1822 onward as Head Engraver. Other notable patrons of the artist included Tsar Alexander I, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the King of Sardinia, King George IV of England, and Prince Borghese."
2053,GISLEBERTUS,(active 1100-1150),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gisleber/biograph.html,"French Romanesque sculptor. He was one of the great geniuses of medieval art, but his name has survived only because he carved his signature — Gislebertus hoc fecit — beneath the feet of the central figure of Christ in the tympanum of the west doorway of Autun Cathedral in Burgundy. The unusually prominent position of his signature suggests that his greatness was appreciated in his own time. The tympanum represents the Last Judgment; it is a huge work (over 6 m. wide at the base) and a masterpiece of expressionistic carving, conveying with awesome power both the horror of the damned and the serenity of the elect. Most of the rest of the sculptural decoration of the cathedral can be confidently attributed to Gislebertus. It includes a carving of Eve, one of the few surviving fragments of the north doorway (now in the Musée Rolin, Autun), a large-scale reclining nude without parallel in medieval art, and the decoration of 60 or so capitals. These display his great fecundity of imagination and range of feeling.

2054,"GISSEY, Henri",(1621-1673),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gissey/biograph.html,"
French draughtsman and costume designer who held the post of ""dessinateur de la Chambre et du cabinet de Roi in the Menus Plaisirs du Roi"" in the early years of Louis XIV of France. Gissey's appointment made him responsible for the expressions of court style, above all in the elaborately costumed and produced ballets de cour, in which the young king danced among his courtiers. He produced the sumptuous engraved festival books that often followed such events and are sometimes the only surviving record of them."

Italian sculptor, active in Austria. He must have received his training in Venice but is documented as working with Andreas Faistenberger (1647-1736) in Munich from 1680. He moved to Vienna in 1689 and worked for the Viennese aristocracy, producing decorative statuary for their palaces and gardens. He became the most important representative of the Italian late Baroque in Vienna."

Giunta Pisano was, with Berlinghiero, one of the earliest Italian painters known to us as individuals. He is known from three surviving crucifixes in Assisi, Pisa and Bologna. He is also known to have painted a crucifix in Assisi, dated 1236 but now lost, and he may have painted the dramatic St Francis (Pisa). His style is more consciously realistic than that of Berlinghiero and In these paintings Christ is represented with his head leaning on one side with an expression of pain and his body bending forward in agony - conception (Christus patiens type of crucifix) differing from ""the triumphant Christ"" of the preceding age.

2059,"GIUSTI, Antonio","(b. 1479, San Martino, d. 1519, Tours)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/giusti/antonio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors active in France. Antonio was born either outside Florence (San Martino) or outside Settignano (Corbignano). He came to France with his brother, Giovanni in 1504 or 1505 and settled in Tours. They changed their name to Juste. Antonio is known to have revisited Italy between 1508 and 1516, during which period he owned a house in Carrara where Michelangelo sometimes stayed when supervising the quarrying of marble. He may therefore have brought back information about artistic events in Italy, thus introducing certain influences from Italy which appear in the later French sculpture of the Giusti (Juste) family."

Swiss painter, active mainly in Paris, where he enjoyed a successful career, particularly with anecdotal scenes, sometimes in an antique setting, and portraits. He was a renowned teacher and when Delaroche closed down his teaching studio in 1843, the majority of his students transferred to Gleyre. He taught Whistler and several of the impressionists - Bazille, Monet, Renoir, and Sisley - and although his own paintings were conventional, he encouraged open-air painting. Renoir, however, said that his main strength as a teacher was that he left his pupils 'pretty much to their own devices'. Gleyre closed his studio in 1864 because of an eye ailment.

English painter. He was employed first as a schoolteacher at Appleby (Cumbria) and after 1794 as a drawing-master at Lichfield (Staffs), from where he sent drawings to London each year; on his occasional visits to the capital he received lessons from William Payne and was clearly influenced by him. In the 1790s he also began to practise in oils, some of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1795 onwards. At the first exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours (April-June 1805) Glover's pictures were priced more highly than those of any other exhibitor; he was elected President of the Society in 1807 and again in 1814-15. In 1820 he held the first of his one-man shows in London, and in 1824 helped set up the Society of British Artists. Glover undertook regular sketching trips in Britain, notably to North Wales and the Lake District, and from 1814 on the Continent.

French painter and engraver. In 1871, after working briefly as a lawyer's clerk, he entered the studio of Isidore Pils at the École des Beaux-Arts. When Pils died in 1875 Henri Lehmann took over the studio and Goeneutte left, moving to Montmartre. He was a regular customer in the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes where he met Renoir and Manet, who strongly influenced his style of painting. He often modelled for Renoir (e.g. The Swing, Moulin de la Galette) and Marcellin Desboutin, who inspired his interest in engraving, etching and drypoint."

2075,"GONÇALVES, Nuno",(active 1450-71),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/goncalve/biograph.html,"
Portuguese painter, the most important Portuguese painter of the 15th century. His work may be said to have initiated the Renaissance in Portuguese painting. He is first named in a document of 1450, when Afonso V (reg 1438–81) appointed him court painter. In 1470 a payment to him is recorded for an altarpiece painted for the chapel of the Palácio Real, Sintra, which, given the dedication of the chapel, probably represented the Pentecost (untraced). A document of 1471 states that Gonçalves replaced the painter Joao Eanes (fl. from 1454) as Pintor das Obras da Cidade de Lisboa (Painter of works for the city of Lisbon)."

French glass painter. He was probably a pupil of Nicolas Macadré. Gontier headed a busy workshop in Troyes in which his three sons, Linard Gontier the Younger, Nicolas Gontier and Jean Gontier were active. His creations are celebrated for their versatility: the rich, deep hues of religious compositions attained through a mastery of the enamelling technique, and the minutely detailed but ambitious secular scenes. He is recorded as having produced a treatise (lost by the 18th century), which demonstrates his commitment to technique."

French painter. In 1865, she began her professional training and took lessons in drawing from the society portraitist Charles Chaplin. Gonzalès became a pupil of the artist Édouard Manet in 1869. Manet is said to have begun a portrait of her at once which was completed in 1870 and exhibited at The Salon in that year. Like her teacher, Édouard Manet, she never exhibited with the Impressionist painters in their controversial exhibitions in Paris, but she is considered part of the group because of her painting style. She was Manet's only formal student and modeled frequently for several members of the Impressionist school. Until 1872, she was strongly influenced by Manet but later developed her own, more personal style. "
2080,"GONZÁLEZ Y SERRANO, Bartolomé","(b. 1564, Valladolid, d. 1627, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gonzalez/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He spent his early years in Valladolid and Madrid. According to Palomino, he was trained with Patricio Cajés, but also important was the influence of Italian Mannerism at the court (1600-06) of Philip III in Valladolid. Knowledge of naturalistic works by such Italians as Orazio Borgianni, with their monumental forms and chiaroscuro, also determined González's style, especially as a religious painter. González is first documented in 1606, after which he worked for the court in Burgos, Lerma, El Pardo and El Escorial. In 1608 he witnessed the will of the court portraitist, Pantoja de la Cruz, who died that year. González succeeded Pantoja de la Cruz in the completion of the royal portaits for the gallery of the palace of El Pardo, which replaced those destroyed by fire in 1604. One of his earliest known portraits is that of Margaret of Austria (1609; Madrid, Prado), which shows the influence of Pantoja de la Cruz.

Italian sculptor and goldsmith. He is documented in Siena, Massa Marittima and Messina. He was the son of Goro di Guccio Ciuti (d before 1311), a Florentine sculptor who, with Lapo and Donato, assistants of Nicola Pisano, was granted citizenship in Siena in 1271. Goro di Guccio Ciuti’s sons Neri and Ambrogio, of whom nothing further is known, followed in their father’s footsteps, as did Goro. His main work is the reliquary of S.

Italian goldsmith and sculptor. Son of a notary, Goro was a successful goldsmith in Siena in the first half of the fifteenth century. He produced goblets, crosses and reliquaries still strongly connected with the style of the fourteenth-century goldsmiths. The highest moment of his career coincided with the construction of the baptismal font of Siena, for which he cast in bronze, between 1428 and 1431, a Fortitude of the style of Donatello."

It was under the name ""Jennyn Van Henegouwe"" (John of Hainaut) that he was received as a master of the Guild of St Luke at Antwerp in 1503. We do not know where he was apprenticed, and his early career is largely obscure. The composition and nature of certain of his religious paintings suggest he may have trained in Bruges, perhaps with Gérard David. But he also seem to have been one of the first representatives of what we may call Antwerp mannerism, as can be seen in his signed drawing, The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine.

French painter and draftsman. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under François-André Vincent, who taught him the art of accurate drawing, brilliant touch and contrasting colours. He became a skilled representative of the academic style prevailing in his earlier period. His portraits are of great distinction in the firmness of graphics. The ""troubadour"" genre subjects which he sent to the Salon from 1808 to 1870 show an ingenious design of theatrical composition, they represent scenes from the Napoleonic era, as well as from the reigns of Charles X and Louis-Philippe."

Soon after beginning a Salon career in his native Paris, Goupil moved on to exhibiting in Brussels and Munich. His work evolved to include more historical subject matter and he began painting scenes of the French Revolution, which garnered him a wider international audience and acclaim."

French engraver, draughtsman, painter and possible goldsmith, member of a family of artists. He was the most distinguished member of the family. He worked in Paris (c. 1508-20) together with his brothers Robert and Gilles de Gourmont; subsequently he was in Lyon (1522-26). His engravings have been identified with those of the monogrammist JG; this is confirmed by the portrait of Cardinal Charles de Bourbon (c. 1551), where this monogram is followed by the inscription 'ourmont fe', completing his name. Three of his plates bear the word Alion."
2099,"GOUTHIÈRE, Pierre","(b. 1732, Bar-sur-Aube, d. 1813, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gouthier/biograph.html,"
French metalworker, who was born at Bar-sur-Aube and went to Paris at an early age as the pupil of Martin Cour. The son of a saddlemaker, Pierre Gouthière rose to become the most famous Parisian bronze chaser and gilder of the late 1700s, receiving commissions from some of the leading connoisseurs of his day. He produced a vast number of superb cast and chiseled gilt bronzes, executed chiefly for the adornment of fine clocks, East Asian and Sèvres porcelains, and furniture."
2100,"GOVAERTS, Abraham","(b. 1589, Antwerpen, d. 1626, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/govaerts/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was the son of Elisabeth Yselstein and Willem Govaerts, a dealer in second-hand clothes and paintings. He was admitted as a master to the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1607-08. In 1609 he bought two houses on the St Jansstraat next to his parents' home. On 9 February 1622 he married Isabella Gillis; they had two daughters. He trained a number of painters: Hans Groenrijs (1617), Andries van den Bogaerde (1619-20), Niclaes Aertsen, Gysbrecht van den Berch and Frans Snyders (the last three from 1623 to 1624). He collaborated with Frans Francken II.

English painter. Nothing is known of Gower's training but he was descended from a Yorkshire gentry family. He was unusual among artists of the day in being of the gentry, bearing arms as grandson of Sir John of Stettenham in Yorkshire. "
2102,"GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de","(b. 1746, Fuendetodos, d. 1828, Bordeaux)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/goya/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter (full name: Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes) and graphic artist. He was the most powerful and original European artist of his time, but his genius was slow in maturing and he was well into his thirties before he began producing work that set him apart from his contemporaries. Born at Fuendetodos in Aragon, the son of a gilder, he served his apprenticeship at Saragossa, then appears to have worked at Madrid for the court painter Francisco Bayeu. In about 1770 he went to Italy but he was back in Saragossa the next year."
2103,"GOYEN, Jan van","(b. 1596, Leiden, d. 1656, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/goyen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, one of the foremost pioneers of realistic landscape painting in the Netherlands. His earliest works are heavily indebted to his master Esaias van de Velde, but he then created a distinctive type of monochrome landscape in browns and greys with touches of vivid blue or red to catch the eye; gnarled oaks; wide plains, usually seen from a height; low horizons and clouded skies. He was one of the first painters to capture the quality of the light and air in a scene and to suggest the movement of clouds.

The name Gozzoli, which though absent from the 1550 edition of Vasari's Lives, appeared in that of 1568 comes from the name ""Ghozzolo"" common in the other branch of the family, the one that had remained in the country.

"
2105,"GRAAT, Barent","(b. 1628, Amsterdam, d. 1709, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/graat/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to his uncle 'Master Hans', an animal painter, with whom he studied for six to seven years. He spent his entire career in Amsterdam. At first he painted landscapes with cattle in the style of Pieter van Laer, but his best works are either domestic interiors or history paintings with figures, or full-length group portraits set in a landscape or interior. These small paintings (e.g. Family in a Landscape, Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) required considerable technical dexterity. Despite the fact that Graat's work is of an excellent standard, he received little recognition. Consequently, his paintings have been sold under the name of better-known artists such as Gerard Terborch, with whose work his own has much in common.

2107,"GRAFF, Anton","(b. 1736, Winterthur, d. 1813, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/graff/biograph.html,"
Graff, born in Switzerland, was the leading German portrait painter of the 18th century. He was a younger contemporary of Reynolds, with whom he is often compared but Graff really belongs to a later generation, since most of his portraits lack the trappings of the Grand Style, and he worked almost into the Biedermeier period."
2108,"GRAMATICA, Antiveduto","(b. ca. 1571, Roma, d. 1626, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gramatic/biograph.html,"Italian painter active mainly in Rome. According to Giovanni Baglione, the artist was given the name Antiveduto (""foreseen"") because his father had a premonition that he would be soon born during a journey between his native Siena and Rome. It was in Rome that Antiveduto was baptised, raised and based his career. His apprenticeship with the Perugian artist Giovanni Domenico Angelini introduced him to small-scale works, mostly on copper. He gained the nickname ""gran Capocciante"" because he specialised in painting heads of famous men. A decade later, in 1591, Antiveduto set up as an independent artist. Giovan Pietro Bellori noted that Caravaggio worked for some months in his studio. Both artists were to enjoy the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte and the Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani.

"
2109,"GRAN, Daniel","(b. 1694, Wien, d. 1757, St Pölten)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gran/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, next to Paul Troger one of the most significant painters of Austrian baroque painting during the first half of the 18th century. The son of an imperial court cook, he first studied with the landscape and genre painter Adam Pankraz Ferg (1651-1729) and then with the decorative and history painter Georg Werle (1668-1727). Werle trained Gran to paint frescoes and introduced him to his first employer and patron, Prince Adam Franz von Schwarzenberg (d 1732). Werle himself worked for the Prince between 1715 and 1719 on frescoes at Ohrada Hunting Lodge, near Frauenberg in Bohemia (now Hluboká, Czech Republic), where he was partly influenced by such Venetian painters as Gregorio Lazzarini and Sebastiano Ricci, as well as by Jacob van Schuppen (1670-1751), a director of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna, and his mentors of the French Baroque classical movement; all were artists who later influenced Gran."
2110,"GRANACCI, Francesco","(b. 1477, Firenze, d. 1543, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/granacci/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter of the generation immediately preceding Michelangelo whose friend he was from early youth. Like Michelangelo, Granacci was a pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio, whose assistant later he became. Granacci was one of the assistants engaged by Michelangelo in 1508 for the beginning of the Sistine ceiling but, like the others, was dismissed after about one month. On his return to Florence Granacci fell under the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, and his later works have elongated figures in an attempt at monumentality. The Dublin Holy Family, which is usually attributed to him, has also been attributed to Michelangelo and shows the approximation of their styles. Basically, however, Granacci was a quattrocento artist and is thus very similar to such transitional painters as Ridolfo Ghirlandaio and Franciabigio.

He was the son of the miniaturist Jean-Baptiste Gérard (1766-1854), and his paternal grandparents were actors known as 'Gérard de Grandville', the source of his pseudonym. He began to draw when very young and published his first lithograph, the Cherry Seller, in Nancy in 1825. From the start he copied the style of the little satirical scenes that had been popularized by the English and French satirical magazines of the period such as the Nain jaune."

French painter, a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. In 1793 he left Aix with the local Société Populaire to assist in the siege of Toulon. He worked as a draughtsman with the artillery battery; his autobiography provides a vivid account of his experiences during the siege and destruction of the town. On a subsequent tour of duty he was employed to paint republican motifs on ships in the naval base at Toulon."
2113,"GRASDORP, Willem","(b. 1678, Zwolle, d. 1723, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grasdorp/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the son of an architectural and genre painter Jan Grasdorp (1651-1693). Willem, according to Arnold Houbraken, was apprenticed in 1697 to the Hamburg still-life painter Ernst Stuven (c.1660-1712), who is purported to have treated him badly and provoked a lawsuit. Grasdorp subsequently became a specialist in flower and fruit still-lifes."

2116,"GRASSI, Józef","(b. 1757, Wien, d. 1838, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grassi_j/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He was the son of a craftsman from Udine and the brother of the sculptor Anton Grassi (1755-1807). In 1768 he started as a student at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna, to which he owed his entire education. His ambitious nature soon ensured that he entered aristocratic circles, where he became a favoured portrait painter, particularly of women, whom he painted in oils and in miniature. His most frequent type was the half-length portrait of young women, generally portrayed with hands crossed on their breast. With pale tones and a liberal use of highlights he achieved a velvety softness of texture and a sentimental atmosphere of dreaminess."
2117,"GRASSI, Nicola","(b. 1682, Formeaso, d. 1748, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grassi_n/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained under Antonio Carneo and settled in Venice about 1709. In 1712, he enrolled in the guild of Friulian painters. Even though he travelled widely, visiting Turkey, Germany, and Dalmatia in 1723-25, he maintained firm contact with his homeland, as is shown by his religious and biblical works. Grassi was also an accomplished portraitist.

He went to Paris in the mid-1660s, returning via Maastricht where he made drawings in 1669-71. Between 1672 and 1676 he was employed as an engineering officer with the army of the Dutch States-General under the Stadholder Prince William III of Orange Nassau. The drawings made during these years are of places in the southern Netherlands, and some include scenes of military activity, but never battles. De Grave settled in The Hague after 1678 and was employed again in the army in 1711.

His sister Maria (ca. 1602-1680) and brother Albert (1613/14 - after 1649) also became painters, and his brother Maurits (c. 1604-1676) became a goldsmith. The family was devoutly Catholic and had close ties to the clergy. Frans de Grebber even sheltered the Amsterdam priest, Simon van Linteloo, in his house and permitted him to celebrate mass in their home. Pieter was a friend of the priest of the Begijnhof (a lay-order religious community), the noted musicologist Jan Albertsz Ban (1597/98-1644), and not only shared his interest in music, but also bought a house in the Beguinage in 1634, living there for the remainder of his life."

Italian painter, wood-engraver and publisher. No paintings by him are known. In August 1546, on his return from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he requested from the Venetian Senate a licence to publish a series of drawings executed during his journey. This privilege being granted, the work was published under the title Particularis et vera descriptio plateae sancti sepulcri ... diligentia Dominici Dalle Greche Venet. Pict. descripta MDXLI ...

He started his career as a painter of ornament, but after studying Andrea Pozzo's treatise Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum (Rome, 1693-1700) he began to produce easel paintings of imaginary views (vedute ideate). He may also have created temporary decorations for religious celebrations."

Once considered a master weaver, he was subsequently revealed as the most influential 15th-century tapestry merchant. He dealt in many of the finest tapestries surviving from the second half of the 15th century. He secured his first payment for textiles from Philip II (the Good), Duke of Burgundy, in 1454-55 and subsequently supplied him with many magnificent and expensive hangings.

French painter. He was a well-known genre and trompe l'oeil painter who taught himself. After arriving in Paris to develop his technique, he was unpleasantly surprised to see one of his paintings, Old Woman Making Lace, on sale under the name of another painter. Grésely set the record straight and the incident made his reputation and he was subsequently inundated with commissions. Unfortunately, ill health forced him to leave Paris, where he had a very successful career, to return home to the provinces.

In 1612 he had a shop at San Marcello. In 1604 he petitioned for a 10-year papal privilege to cover work that he intended to engrave after his own inventions. The privilege was granted. He had interests in the sciences, especially mathematics and engraved the plates for Galileo's book on Sunspots of 1613, under the supervision of Cigoli."
2132,"GREUZE, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1725, Tournus, d. 1805, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/greuze/biograph.html,"
French painter. He had a great success at the 1755 Salon with his Father Reading the Bible to his Children (Louvre, Paris) and went on to win enormous popularity with similar sentimental and melodramatic genre scenes. His work was praised by Diderot as 'morality in paint' and as representing the highest ideal of painting in his day. He also wished to succeed as a history painter, but his Septimius Severus Reproaching Caracalla (Louvre, 1769) was rejected by the Salon, causing him acute embarrassment. Much of Greuze's later work consisted of titillating pictures of young girls, which contain thinly veiled sexual allusions under their surface  appearance of mawkish innocence; The Broken Pitcher (Louvre) for example, alludes to lost virginity."
2133,"GREVENBROECK, Alessandro",(active 1717-1747 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grevenbr/alessand/biograph.html,"
Alessandro Grevenbroeck belonged to a Dutch family of painters who lived in Italy for a generation. Little is known about him. He was a landscape painter working in the style of Claude Lorrain. He painted a naval battle scene for Tsar Peter the Great that was intended for the Peterhof Palace. Similar marine paintings and landscapes by Grevenbroeck were dated 1717, 1737 and 1747, all of which he painted in Venice or the Veneto.

Dutch painter, active in England. He was a pupil of the landscape painter Roelant Roghman. About 1666 he moved to London, where he derived more instruction from the Anglicised Dutch painter Jan Looten (1618-1681). Both these painters employed an earthy tonality and frequently painted on a large scale. Only one painting by Griffier, an immense and spectacular Noah's Ark (ex-Nettlecombe Court, Somerset), illustrates these twin influences. Griffier's other paintings of his middle years are quite at variance with this style: he executed numerous small Rhineland views in a highly finished and refined technique reminiscent in both colour and subject-matter of the mature style of Herman Saftleven."

Italian architect, part of a family of architects, son of Guglielmo de' Grigi. He had a long association with the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice. In 1549 he was appointed proto to the works on the death of Antonio Scarpagnino, although by the time of his appointment much of the main fabric was already complete, and his own works were chiefly confined to interior decorations. He remained there until 1560, when he left after one of the many notable disputes that characterized relations between the Scuola Grande and its architects."

Romanian painter. From 1848 he trained in Bucharest with various church painters, producing icons and religious mural decorations. These works, which soon attracted attention, were influenced in style by the Viennese classicism widespread in the Romanian principalities in the early 19th century and by the Italian academicism established there after 1850 by Gheorghe Tattarescu (1818-1894)."

German silversmith. Together with his brothers Andries and Johannes, Anthonie Grill moved to Amsterdam from Augsburg in the 1630s. Here he worked as a silversmith, becoming specialised in assaying over the years: testing the content of gold or silver. In 1651 he established a workshop for this purpose in a building on Looiersgracht. Two years later he concluded a contract for the extraction of gold and silver with his brother Andries in The Hague. However, major financial difficulties forced him to sell his property in 1661. Grill had already left Amsterdam by that time. He had moved to Sweden in 1659, where he remained until his death in 1675.

His first important building, San Paolo Maggiore (1581-1603), erected over the ancient temple of Castor and Pollux, proves him an architect of uncommon ability. In spite of certain provincialism, the design of San Paolo has breadth and a sonorous quality that may well be called Early Baroque."
2143,"GRIMALDI, Giacomo","(b. 1560, Bologna, d. 1623, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grimaldi/biograph.html,"
Italian priest, writer, and archivist. His principal surviving works deal with the Roman Catholic Church. Several Papal tombs that were destroyed during the rebuilding of Saint Peter's basilica are only known through illustrations by Grimaldi, the basilica's notary. His drawings and descriptions have provided scholars ever since with some of the most detailed information known about the early Christian basilica. Grimaldi was also instrumental in creating a type of museum in the crypt under the new St. Peter's, known as the Vatican grottoes, consisting of painted views of the old church, as well as artifacts from its many altars and chapels."
2144,"GRIMALDI, Giovanni Francesco","(b. 1606, Bologna, d. 1680, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grimaldx/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, sometimes called Il Bolognese. He was an all-around talent who worked as painter, printmaker, draftsman, and architect. Grimaldi first studied in Bologna in the circle of the Carracci. Around 1626 he went to Rome; by 1635, he was a member of the Accademia di San Luca and associated with the artists working with Pietro da Cortona. In Rome, Grimaldi regularly collaborated on public decorations with other artists, including Alessandro Algardi and Gaspard Dughet. "
2145,"GRIMMER, Abel","(b. ca. 1570, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1619, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grimmer/abel/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Jacob Grimmer. He studied with his father in Antwerp, then in 1592 he was accepted as Master of the Guild of the Painters of Saint Luke."
2146,"GRIMMER, Jacob","(b. ca. 1525, Antwerpen, d. 1590, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grimmer/jacob/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, father of Abel Grimmer. He did his apprenticeship in Antwerp in 1539, studying under Gabriel Bauwens, Mathys Cock and Cerstian van den Queckborn. He became a free master in 1547, married in 1548 and had four children. He most probably travelled to Italy as was the norm for young painters."
2147,"GRIMOU, Alexis","(b. 1678, Argenteuil, d. 1733, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grimou/biograph.html,"
French painter. In 1704 he married a niece of the tavern-keeper Procope, whose house in Paris was a meeting-place for artists and intellectuals. The following year Grimou was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Although instructed by the Académie to paint as his morceaux de réception portraits of the sculptor Jean Raon (1630-1707) and the painter Antoine Coypel, he failed to present either picture and in 1709 the agrément was annulled. As a result he joined the Académie de St Luc."
2148,"GRISÉE, Louis-Joseph","(b. 1822, Saint Cyr l'Ecole, d. ca. 1867, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grisee/biograph.html,"
French painter. He entered the École des Beaux-Arts as a pupil of Paul Delaroche in 1842. He frequently exhibited genre and literary pictures as well as enamel portraits at the Salon from 1844 through 1867.

2149,"GROENEWEGEN, Pieter Anthonisz. van","(b. ca. 1600, Delft, d. 1658, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/groenewe/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, specialised in landscapes. He was influenced by his sojourn in Italy (1615-1623), having joined the 'Bentveughel' circle there under the sobriquet ""Lion"" in the 1620's, joining Bramer and Breenbergh there. He is seen as follower of Breenbergh and Jacob Pynas."
2150,"GROET, Adriaen de",(active around 1562 in 's-Hertogenbosch),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/groet/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish silversmith, active in 's-Hertogenbosch. He became a master of the 's-Hertogenbosch silversmiths' guild in 1557. His work demonstrate his ability in embossing and engraving. No other biographical data are available about him.



"
2151,"GROHAR, Ivan","(b. 1867, Spodnj Sorica, d. 1911, Ljubljana)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grohar/biograph.html,"
Slovenian painter. He studied for three years at the Graz School of Painting under the Slovenian painter M. Bredaska and the Italian painter N. Milanesi. In 1896 he studied at the Azbe School in Munich, where he was influenced by Franz von Defregger (1835-1921) and Arnold Böcklin. After 1902 he evolved towards Impressionism and with other Yugoslav painters tried to develop a distinctly Slovenian version of modern art. His first works in this period were in Late Romantic and Art Nouveau style and were visibly influenced by the North Italian painter Giovanni Segantini, especially his pantheistic landscapes and firm brushwork."
2152,"GROMANN, Nicholas",(active 1537-1574 in Saxony),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gromann/biograph.html,"
German architect. He was a Saxon court architect who designed in Schloss Hartenfels the first church specifically for Protestant worship.



"
2153,"GRONDONCK, Bartholomeus",(active c. 1617 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grondonc/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. This less-known painter of landscapes in early 17th century Flanders was much influenced by Hans Bol and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Only one signed painting by him is known, a well-preserved copper depicting the Kermesse of Oudenarde.



"
2154,"GROOTH, Johann Friedrich","(b. 1717, Stuttgart, d. 1801, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grooth/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Russia. He moved to St Petersburg in 1743 and subsequently was appointed painter to the court of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, the daughter of Peter the Great and Catherine I. He studied with his father and taught in the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (academician from 1765)."
2155,"GROPPO, Cesare",(active around 1600),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/groppo/biograph.html,"
Italian bronze founder of Genoese origin. In 1603 he executed two bronze reliefs for the funerary monument of Doge Marino Grimani and his wife (San Giuseppe di Castello, Venice).



"
2156,"GROS, Antoine-Jean","(b. 1771, Paris, d. 1835, Meudon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gros/biograph.html,"
French painter. He trained with his father, a  miniaturist and then with Jacques-Louis David. Although he revered David and became one of his favourite pupils, Gros had a passionate nature and he was drawn more to the colour and vibrancy of Rubens and the great Venetian painters than to the Neoclassical purity of his master."
2157,"GROSSO, Niccolò",(active c. 1500 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grosso/biograph.html,"
Italian ironsmith. He was praised by Vasari as the best of ironsmiths. His nickname, Il Caparra, (""payment in advance"") presumably refers to his financial arrangements. His finest work is mounted on the exterior of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and includes a lantern shaped like a temple and flag-pole holders decorated with fabulous creatures.


"
2158,"GRUBACS, Carlo","(b. 1812, Venezia, d. 1870, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grubacs/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of animated urban waterscapes and architectural features. Carlo Grubacs was born in Venice in 1812. The son of a Merchant Navy captain whose family, originally from Montenegro, had settled in Italy in the second half of the 18th century, he belonged to the Venetian school of 'Vedutista' which had flourished with artists like Canaletto and Francesco Guardi in the 18th century."
2159,"GRUBICY DE DRAGON, Vittore","(b. 1851, Milano, d. 1920, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grubicy/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, dealer, critic and collector of Hungarian origin. Around 1870 he frequented the circle of Gli Scapigliati and in 1870-71 visited London. Grubicy's acquaintance with the art galleries there inspired him to start his own gallery in Milan, specializing in the Scapigliati artists, particularly Tranquillo Cremona (1837-1878) and later Daniele Ranzoni (1843-1889). After Cremona's death in 1878, Grubicy extended his interest to younger Lombard artists, primarily Giovanni Segantini, whose Choir of San Antonio impressed him at the 1879 annual exhibition at the Brera, Milan, Emilio Longoni (1859-1932) and later Angelo Morbelli. Grubicy became Segantini's dealer and they were in close collaboration from this time."
2160,"GRUEBER, Pancratius",(mentioned in 1520),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grueber/biograph.html,"
German wood sculptor and painter. He was born to a family originally from Grossenhain (Saxony). No biographical data are available.

The wings of the altarpiece of the Antonite monastery at Isenheim, in southern Alsace (dated 1515), are considered to be his masterpiece.

"
2163,"GRUPELLO, Gabriel","(b. 1644, Geraardsbergen, d. 1730, Kerkrade)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/grupello/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, active in Germany. He was the son of a Milanese cavalry captain and a Flemish mother. He trained in Antwerp with the sculptor Artus Quellinus I from 1658 and probably took part in the sculptural decoration of the Stadhuis in Amsterdam. He was in France before 1670; there he would have seen the sculptural work at the château of Versailles, executed under the direction of Charles Le Brun and François Girardon. In 1673 he was a master in the guild of the Four Crowned Heads in Brussels. He became municipal sculptor and, in 1688, court sculptor to Charles II of Spain. Among his works dating from this period are the classicising garden statues of Diana and Narcissus (Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) and the elaborate Rubensian wall fountain with marine gods (marble, 1675; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels), made for the fishmongers' guild of Brussels."

Adriaen de Gryef (also Grijef), Flemish painter. He was the son and pupil of the Dutch still-life painter Jacques de Claeuw (active 1642-1676, also called Grief). His first dated painting is from 1675, the last from 1722. He married in 1689 in Antwerp. In 1690, he resided in Brussels, then returned to Antwerp in 1694."
2165,GUALTIERO PADOVANO,"(b. ca. 1510, Padova, d. 1552, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gualtier/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Gualtiero dall'Arzere. He was an exponent of the Paduan-Titianesque school, during a period when Giuseppe Salviati (Giuseppe Porta), Lambert Sustris, Domenico Campagnola, and Giuseppe Maria Falconetto were active in Padua. He was highly esteemed by his contemporaries."
2166,"GUARANA, Jacopo","(b. 1720, Venezia, d. 1808, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guarana/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He first studied the work of Sebastiano Ricci and then that of Giambattista Tiepolo. Throughout his career Jacopo faithfully followed the great Venetian decorative artists of the 18th century. He was resident in Venice for the whole of his life and is documented as travelling to Ravenna, where in 1751 he decorated the dome of San Vitale, taking over from Ubaldo Gandolfi. He also worked at Valnogaredo (1763) and Strà (1770)."
2167,"GUARDI, Francesco","(b. 1712, Venezia, d. 1793, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guardi/francesc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He is now famous for his views of Venice, indeed next to Canaletto he is the most celebrated view painter of the 18th century, but he produced work on a great variety of subjects and seems to have concentrated on views only after the death of his brother Gianantonio (1699-1760). Until then Francesco's personality was largely submerged in the family studio, of which Gianantonio was head and which handled commissions of every kind."
2168,"GUARDI, Giacomo","(b. 1764, Venezia, d. 1835, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guardi/giacomo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of Francesco Guardi, the veduta painter. He began his career in the atelier of his father. His work is very similar to that of his father, often making a certain attribution to either of them very difficult. Some works were produced in collaboration. Giacomo worked a lot for French, Italian and English patrons and is best known for his landscapes."
2169,"GUARDI, Gianantonio","(b. 1699, Wien, d. 1760, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guardi/giananto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (usually called Gianantonio Guardi), member of a family of artists. He was the elder brother of Francesco Guardi, who is famous for his views of Venice, and is the best-known member of the family. They collaborated on some religious paintings. Gianantonio presumably took over the studio in Venice at the age of 17, on his father's death. Various documents relating to him have been published: he was elected a founder-member of the Venetian Accademia in 1756 (whereas his brother Francesco was elected only in 1784); he inherited an estate in the Val di Sole in 1737 from his father's brother; in 1739 another member of the family, the priest Pietro Antonio Guardi, obtained from the family studio in Venice three lunettes - depicting the Sacrilegious Communion, the Washing of the Disciples' Feet and the Vision of St Francis - for his parish church in Vigo d'Anaunia, near Trento, and (probably a little later) the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child and Four Saints (all still in situ).

"
2170,GUARIENTO d'Arpo,(active 1338-1368 in Padua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guarient/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the leading painter of his time in Padua and is first recorded there as a master in 1338. The origin of his eclectic but highly distinctive style is not to be explained in terms of the influence of an ill-defined regional Byzantinism, as posited in older accounts, but rather as an alert and discriminating synthesis of trends current in the Veneto following visits to the area by such artists as Giotto and Giovanni Pisano. Guariento’s style combines elements obviously drawn from Giotto’s work in Padua and elsewhere with a more overtly Gothic sense of line and rhythm and a dramatic approach to narrative, occasionally verging on caricature.


"
2171,"GUARINI, Guarino","(b. 1624, Modena, d. 1683, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guarini/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and theorist. He was accepted as a Theatine novice in 1639, spent his novitiate at the monastery of San Silvestro al Quirinale in Rome, and returned to Modena in 1647, where he was ordained in 1648. He became provost in 1654. He left Modena and became a member of the Theatine House of Parma in 1656 and apparently visited Prague and Lisbon before publishing his play La Pieta trionfante in Messina in 1660, where he was a lecturer in mathematics."
2172,"GUARINO, Francesco","(b. 1611, Sant'Agata Irpina, nr Solofra, d. 1654, Gravina di Puglia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guarino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was first taught by his father, Giovanni Tommaso Guarino (d. 1637), and then trained in the studio of Massimo Stanzione, during that painter's brief Caravaggesque phase, and responded to the naturalism of Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, Filippo Vitale and the Roman Caravaggisti of the 1620s."
2173,"GUAS, Juan","(b. ca. 1430, Saint-Pol-de-Léon, d. 1496, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guas/biograph.html,"
French architect and possibly sculptor, active in Spain. He was the most prominent exponent of the Hispano-Flemish or Isabelline style. Guas was the son of the mason Pedro Guas, who arrived in Toledo from Brittany c. 1440 with the group of masons led by Hanequin de Bruselas, in whose workshop Juan Guas probably trained. The first proof of his works dates back to 1448, year in which he collaborated with his father (possibly as a sculptor) on works done at the Puerta de los Leones (Lions' Gate) on the Cathedral in Toledo. His supposed brothers Enrique and Bonifacio, cited as assistants through the mistaken interpretation of an inscription and a document, never existed. In 1453 he was named as an assistant in the building of the Puerta de los Leones. In 1458 he was listed as a master mason in the cathedral accounts, and in the following year he married Marina Álvarez."
2174,"GUCCI, Santi","(b. ca. 1530, Firenze, d. ca. 1600, Mirów Castle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gucci/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, active in Poland. He was taught by his father, the restorer of the cathedral in Florence, and the sculptor Baccio Bandinelli. Before coming to Poland, Gucci created some sculptures in Florence, but no details about these works are known."
2175,"GUDIN, Théodore","(b. 1802, Paris, d. 1880, Boulogne-sur-Seine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gudin/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He studied under Anne-Louis Girodet and Antoine-Jean Gros at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which he entered on 30 January 1817. With the emergence of the Romantic movement he interrupted his Neo-classical training to become a disciple and friend of Delacroix and Géricault. Like Delacroix, he first exhibited at the Salon in 1822, and his submission included the depiction of an eminently Romantic subject, Episodes from a Shipwreck. However, his greatest success of the 1820s, which established him as a marine painter, was the Fire on the Kent, which he exhibited at the Salon of 1827. Following this direction he cultivated his talent for historical naval subjects on a large scale, becoming France's leading painter of sea battles. His style is characterized by the faithful rendering of water, the use of impasto and the careful execution of motifs."
2176,"GUÉLARD, Jean-Baptiste-Antoine",(1719-c. 1755),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guelard/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker, probably identical with Jean Gueslart, painter and professor of the Académie de Saint-Luc in 1738. There is a considerably confusion between the various homonyms: both Jean-Baptiste Guélard and Antoine Guélard were active printmakers in Paris c. 1730-50. Jean-Baptiste published a lavishly illustrated 'Description abrégée des principeaux arts et métiers' (Paris, 1743). He engraved still-life pieces after Oudry.

He was self-taught but developed precociously. Despite the fact that he spent much of his life in Cento, a small provincial town between Bologna and Ferrara, he managed to become one of the major artists of his day. He was early inspired by the classical reforms of Lodovico Carracci but his pictures were full of movement and intense feeling.

"
2178,"GUÉRIN, Pierre-Narcisse","(b. 1774, Paris, d. 1833, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guerin/biograph.html,"
One of the most successful French painters of his period. He won the Prix de Rome in 1797, and his later successes included becoming director of the French Academy in Rome in 1822 and being created a baron in 1829. His style was derived mainly from David, but his scenes from classical history and mythology are less severe and more stagey. As the teacher of Géricault and Delacroix amongst others, he was an important figure in the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism. He laid particular emphasis on the painted sketch and as a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, he was instrumental in establishing a sketch competition as a preliminary to the Prix de Rome.



"
2179,"GUÉRIN, Gilles","(b. ca. 1606, Paris, d 1678, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guerin_g/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was apprenticed to Charles Le Brun and completed two sets of Caryatids for the Louvre. In 1646, he was put in charge of the erection of Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé's tomb in the family château de Valery. He designed the rood screen for the church of Saint-Gervais in Soissons and adorned it with several statues. He produced the ornamentation for the King's bedroom at the Louvre. In 1654, he produced the full-length statue of Louis XIV for the courtyard of the Hôtel de Ville."
2180,"GUÉRIN, Jean-Urbain","(b. 1761, Strasbourg, d. 1836, Obernay)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guerin_j/biograph.html,"
French miniaturist. He went to Paris c. 1785 where he painted portraits of the members of the royal family, including Marie-Antoinette, as well as portraits of other important personages. During the Consulate and the Empire he continued to paint portraits of Napoleon's generals and ladies of the imperial court. The celebrated miniaturists such as Marie-Anne Fragonard (née Gérard), Jean-Baptiste Augustin and Jean-Urbain Guérin are synonymous with the golden age of miniature painting in France.

2181,"GUÉRIN, Paulin-Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1783, Toulon, d. 1855, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guerin_p/biograph.html,"
Paulin-Jean-Baptiste Guérin (also Paulin-Guérin), French painter. The son of a locksmith he began his life in poverty, painting a number of self-portraits as he could not afford models."

Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri (Guerreri or Guerini), Italian painter working in the style of Caravaggio and Guercino. Apparently self-taught, he made copies after Federico Barocci. In 1606 he went to Rome and came under the influence of Caravaggio and his followers, above all of Orazio Gentileschi. He returned home, probably in 1614, and at this time produced his most important works, two paintings of the Miracles of St Nicholas of Tolentino (Santa Maria del Piano, Sassoferrato), in which the interpretation is realistic and the figures are monumental and strongly lit."
2183,"GUGGENBICHLER, Johann Meinrad","(b. 1649, Einsiedeln, d. 1723, Mondsee)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guggenbi/biograph.html,"
Swiss sculptor, active in Austria. One of the foremost Baroque artists producing carved wood altars in the alpine area of Upper Austria, he was the son of Georg Guggenbichler, who worked for Einsiedeln Monastery as a sculptor and master builder. Meinrad Guggenbichler's works suggest that his travels as a young journeyman included areas of northern Italy. By 1670 he was working as an assistant to a woodcarver at the monastery of St Florian, near Linz, in Upper Austria. The greatest impact on the young artist came, however, from the local wood carving traditions of the Innviertel and the Salzburg Flachgau areas, where he had relations, a style reflected in such early works as the high altar (1675) in Strasswalchen Parish Church (extant, but no longer in original setting)."
2184,"GUGLIELMI, Gregorio","(b. 1714, Roma, d. 1773, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guglie/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active also in Germany and Central Europe. He trained either with Francesco Trevisani or with Sebastiano Conca. He was a protégé of Cardinal Alessandro Albani, and his early activity was centred in Rome, where he executed three canvases for St Catherine, Prague (one, St Augustine, in situ; two untraced), and the main altarpiece for S Apollonia, Rome (untraced). His Canonization of St Camillo de Lellis (Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) dates from 1746. His frescoes included those in the hospital of the Santo Spirito in Sassia (1742; destroyed); History Commands Time to Reveal the Truth (1746; Palazzo Corsini, Rome), commissioned by Cardinal Neri Corsini to decorate the history section of the Biblioteca Corsiniana in the Palazzo Corsini, Rome; the vault fresco, St Giovanni de Matha in Glory (1744-8), in Santa Trinità degli Spagnoli, Rome, and frescoes in the refectory of San Agostino, Rome, 1750-51; in situ). In these first documented works the use of warm, luminous colours and strongly modelled figures within a naturalistic composition demonstrates the artist's desire to unite the late Baroque of Conca with the developing classicism of Pierre Subleyras and Marco Benefial."
2185,GUGLIELMO VENEZIANO,(active 1352-1382 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gugliel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter with a fondness for archaic models and Byzantine influences. Little is recorded about Guglielmo's life, though two signed works by him are known: a polyptych in the abbey of San Martino in Piove di Sacco, Padua, and a triptych in the Museo Diocesano in Recanati in the Marches, which is dated 1382. Another polyptych by the artist is in the Duomo of Salò in Lombardy, and represents a Madonna Enthroned with Saints."
2186,"GUGLIELMO, Fra","(b. ca. 1235, Pisa, d. ca. 1310, ?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guglielm/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He assisted Nicola Pisano on the tomb of St Dominic for S Domenico in Bologna (dispersed; sarcophagus, in situ). Two groups of deacons (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts; Florence, Bargello) from the tomb are attributed to him. His best known work is the pulpit in San Giovanni Fuorcivitas, Pistoia.



"
2187,"GUIDI, Domenico","(b. 1625, Torano, d. 1701, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guidi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. Born in Tuscany, he went to Naples in 1639 to assist his uncle, Giuliano Finelli, in the execution of a series of 13 statues (1646, Naples Cathedral, chapel of S Januarius) representing the patron saints of Naples. He remained under Finelli's tutelage for the next decade, during which time he was involved in the popular revolt led by Masaniello against the Spanish in 1647-8. In 1648 he arrived in Rome where he entered the studio of Alessandro Algardi. He remained there until Algardi's death in 1654 when he established himself as an independent sculptor."
2188,GUIDO DA SIENA,(active in the second half of 13th century in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guido/biograph.html,"
Guido da Siena was the all but mythical founder of the Sienese School. He signed a picture in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena, and dated it 1221, but there are other pictures, also in Siena, associable with him which are datable 1262 and in the 1270s. There are therefore two schools of thought:"
2189,GUIDO DI GRAZIANO,(active 1275-1300 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guido_g/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Siena, sometimes confused with Guido da Siena, another painter in Siena, active in the second half of the 13th century. Guido di Graziano has obviously followed Cimabue whose style differs completely from the more archaic style of Duccio. One can see in his paintings the delicate quality of colour, rich tones and transparencies, as well as at the fluidity of line, free of the rigid constraints of the preceding manner. The painter is distinguished by his undeniable talent to create simple and effective settings."
2190,"GUIDOBONO, Bartolomeo","(b. 1654, Savona, d. 1709, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guidobon/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His father, Giovanni Antonio Guidobono (d. 1685), was a maiolica painter and his brother Domenico Guidobono a decorative fresco painter. Bartolomeo Guidobono worked in Savona, Genoa and Turin, and his art brought an elegant, graceful spirit to late Baroque painting in Genoa, offering an alternative to the robustness of his friend and mentor, Domenico Piola, and to the flamboyance of Gregorio de' Ferrari. The small, multiple drapery folds, soft lighting and sweet-faced figures inspired by Correggio made his work irresistible to the public, invaluable to the Casa Piola, and influential on Daniel Seiter and, later, Stefano Maria Legnani (1660-1715) in Turin.

2191,"GUIDOBONO, Domenico","(b. ca. 1668, Savona, d. 1746, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guidobon/domenico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Bartolomeo Guidobono. When he was baptized in the church of St. John the Baptist in Savona, his godfather was the Genovese painter Domenico Piola, one of the eminent members of the Piola family, which operated a large workshop known as the 'Casa Piola'. It is likely therefore that in addition to being trained by his father, Domenico Guidobono also benefited from training in the Casa Piola."

2193,"GUILLAIN, Simon","(b. 1581, Paris, d. 1658, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guillain/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, son of Nicolas Guillain (c. 1560-1639), a wood-carver from Cambrai. He was trained by his father and studied with Alessandro Algardi in Rome, returning to France in 1612; he went on to become one of the leading sculptors of the reign of Louis XIII, rivalled only by Jacques Sarazin. Brought up in the craftsmanlike and realist traditions of late 16th-century French sculpture, he absorbed the influences of the Italian Baroque and through his pupils François Anguier and Michel Anguier helped to form the French classical style in sculpture. He collaborated with his father on a number of works, including a fountain (1613; destroyed) for the château of Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne, and the praying figures of Président Jeannin and his wife Anne Guéniot (marble, 1626-27; Autun Cathedral)."
2194,"GUILLAUMIN, Armand","(b. 1841, Paris, d. 1927, Orly)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guillau/biograph.html,"
French painter and lithographer. He grew up in Moulins, but at 16 he returned to Paris to find work. Despite the opposition of his working-class family, he prepared for an artistic career while he supported himself in municipal jobs. He started drawing classes and then enrolled in the Académie Suisse, where he met Cézanne and Camille Pissarro. Guillaumin began his career as an avant-garde artist by exhibiting with them at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. He was also active in the Manet circle at the Café Guerbois, from which Impressionism developed."
2195,"GUILLAUME, Jean-Baptiste-Claude-Eugène","(b. 1822, Montbard, d. 1905, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guillaum/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and writer. Having attended drawing school in Dijon, he entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, in 1841. He won the Prix de Rome in 1845 and during his stay in Rome produced several works that were enthusiastically received by the Académie. These included the marble statue of Anacreon (exh. Salon 1852; Paris, Musée d'Orsay), the hedonistic Classical subject and precise execution of which betray Guillaume's debt to his master, James Pradier. Another piece from his years in Rome, The Reaper (bronze, 1849; Paris, Musée d'Orsay), while not going so far as to infringe Classical conventions, frees the representation of labour from traditional poetics.

2197,"GUNDELACH, Matthäus","(b. ca. 1566, Hessen, d. 1653, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gundelac/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Prague. He was the son of the painter Hans Gundelach. The young Gundelach was in Prague by his mid-twenties where he signed and dated a drawing Minerva and Ceres (1593). It is apparent from the handful of early copies by Gundelach of works by Bartholomäus Spranger that he was a great admirer of the older Antwerp-born master, but he quickly became closely associated with Joseph Heintz, court painter for Emperor Rudolph II. It has been suggested that Gundelach was a pupil of Heintz as he completed at least one work by him, and is recorded as having copied his drawings."
2198,"GUNST, Pieter Stevens van","(b. ca. 1658, Amsterdam, d. 1732, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gunst/biograph.html,"

2199,"GÜNTHER, Franz Ignaz","(b. 1725, Altmannstein, d. 1775, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/gunther/biograph.html,"
Bavarian sculptor. After a varied training culminating in some years at the Vienna Academy he settled in Munich in 1754. His short career was productive of a considerable quantity of wood-carving combining a very elegant Rococo style with a highly emotional religious content. In 1759-62 he produced his chief work, the almost entire furnishing of the church at Rott-am-Inn.

German painter of the Baroque and Rococo era. After basic instruction in Murnau, Matthäus Günther became the pupil and assistant of Cosmas Damian Asam. He had no direct contact with Johann Evangelist Holzer, who was his junior, but he acquired out of his estate various drawings and can be considered his legitimate artistic successor. He was made master in Augsburg in 1731 and subsequently worked as an independent fresco painter. In 55 years he decorated over sixty rooms. His main works were produced in the Benedictine churches at Amorbach and Rott am Inn, the Augustinian Canonical churches at Indersdorf and Rottenbuch, the parish churches at Sterzing, Mittenwald and Oberammergau, and the Great Hall at Sünching castle. Günther worked in Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia and the Tyrol and can be considered as one of the most important representatives of south German fresco painting."
2201,"GUTHRIE, James","(b. 1859, Greenock, d. 1930, Rhu, Strathclyde)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/g/guthrie/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He originally enrolled at Glasgow University to study law but in 1877 his father, a member of the Scottish clergy, allowed him to train as a painter under James Drummond (1816-1877). In 1878 he began work in John Pettie's (1839-1893) studio in London where he was encouraged to produce academic history and genre paintings. Every summer from 1878 to 1881, however, Guthrie returned to Scotland to paint landscapes alongside Joseph Crawhall (1861-1913) and Edward Arthur Walton. He was influenced by the work of Jean-François Millet and the Barbizon school and in the spring of 1882 completed his first major realist painting, Funeral Service in the Highlands (Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow)."

Austrian portrait painter. He studied painting under Martin Johann Schmidt. By 1770 he was working for the Esterházy family, where he painted portraits of the reigning prince, Nikolaus (Miklós) Esterházy, and possibly the portrait of Joseph Haydn. He also created decorative paintings for Nikolaus's new palace at Eszterháza."

2207,"HAAGEN, Joris Abrahamsz. van der","(b. ca. 1615, Arnhem, d. 1669, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haagen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, specialized in landscapes. Archival evidence shows that he started his drawing career in Arnhem. He probably learned to paint from his father, the painter Abraham van der Haagen. When his father died he moved in 1639 to the Hague, where he joined the Guild of St. Luke in 1643. A year later he became honorary citizen of The Hague. In 1656 he was one of the founding members of the Confrerie Pictura, which was located on the Princessegracht in the Hague. The painting he made of the Princessegracht at this time probably shows the original building, which has since been renovated beyond recognition. He died in The Hague."
2208,"HAAN, Ignacio","(b. 1758, Alicante, d. 1810, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haan/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect, considered one of the most important architects of the Neoclassical style in Spain. He was a disciple of Francesco Sabatini. He had come from his hometown to Madrid to study at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, where he graduated and obtained a pension in Rome. He developed almost all of his work in Toledo under the protection of Cardinal Francisco de Lorenzana."
2209,"HABERLE, John","(b. 1856, New Haven, d. 1933, New Haven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haberle/biograph.html,"
American painter and lithographer. The son of German immigrants, he displayed an early talent for drawing. At 14 he was apprenticed to a lithographer in New Haven and subsequently earned his living in that field. His only formal training was at the New York National Academy of Design in 1884. Haberle spent most of his life in New Haven, where he was a founder of the New Haven Sketch Club (1884), gave art lessons and was active in art circles until about 1900. In the 1880s he also worked for the Peabody Museum at Yale University as a preparator and designer, occasionally drawing illustrations for its publications."
2210,"HABERT, François",(active mid-17th century in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/habert/biograph.html,"
French painter. Little is known about the life of the artist. His oeuvre consists of a small number of signed still-lifes, that reveal how Habert was influenced by the many Dutch and Flemish still-life artists living in Paris, who brought with them the more sumptuous and decorative style that was to dominate the genre in the second half of the seventeenth century. His fruit pieces, for example, find inspiration in the works of Jan Fyt and Jan Davidsz. de Heem, while his floral still-lifes reveal an awareness of the paintings of Jean-Michel Picart.


"
2211,"HACKAERT, Jan","(b. ca. 1628, Amsterdam, d. ca. 1685, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hackaert/biograph.html,"

2212,"HACKERT, Georg Abraham","(b. 1755, Prenzlau, d. 1805, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hackert/georg/biograph.html,"
German painter, brother of Jacob Philipp Hackert. He trained in Berlin with Friedrich Gottlieb Berger and went to Italy in 1776 at the invitation of his elder brother Philipp. Though his training was based mainly on 17th-century Dutch and Flemish art, he was soon influenced by the Neo-classical theories of Winckelmann and Mengs. His work in Rome compromises effectively between a calligraphic approach and the Romantic spirit. In fact, while faithfully rendering his brother's landscapes, he managed to infuse a new sense of nature into his engravings. He had the ability to illustrate a scene as if engraving from life rather than from a painting. Georg did most of his work in Naples, where the Bourbon court appointed him official engraver. In this position he was an upholder and propagator of Neo-classical theories, but his influence on Neapolitan engraving, especially through his renderings of his brother's great canvases of Ports of the Realm, remains to be studied. He fled Naples with his brother in 1799.

2213,"HACKERT, Jacob Philipp","(b. 1737, Prenzlau, d. 1807, San Piero di Careggio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hackert/philipp/biograph.html,"
German landscape painter, part of a family of painters, active in Italy from 1768. He studied in Berlin under the French painter Le Sueur, who taught him in the classical Baroque style of Dutch landscape, but when he moved to Rome he became one of the ""Roman Germans"" to turn to Poussin and apply the Neoclassical principles to landscape painting. In 1786 he became court painter to Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was a sensitive upholder of the ideal landscape tradition of Claude, which he seasoned with touches of Romanticism. Much of his prolific output was devoted to views of famous sites, which were eagerly sought by foreign visitors to Italy. He came from a family of artists and often collaborated with his brother Johann Gottlieb Hackert (1744-73). Goethe met Hackert in 1787 and wrote his biography in 1811.



"
2214,"HAECHT, Willem van","(b. 1593, Antwerpen, d. 1637, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haecht/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was the son of the landscape painter Tobias Verhaecht, the first teacher of Rubens. Willem grew up in a cultivated milieu of art and humanism and was taught to paint by his father. In 1615 he went to Paris, where he stayed until 1619; thereafter he travelled to Italy and in 1626-27 returned to Antwerp, where he became a master in the city's Guild of St Luke. By 1628 he was employed by the patron, collector and amateur Cornelis van der Geest as curator of his collection, a post he held until his death.

2216,"HAEN, David de","(b. ca. 1597, Amsterdam, d. 1622, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was born in Amsterdam and moved to Rome at a young age where he would remain the rest of his life. He was a key figure in the community of Northern artists who settled Rome in the first two decades of the 17th century, and was a close associate of Dirck van Baburen, one of the leading practitioners of the rapidly developing Caravagesque style in Rome. He worked with Dirk van Baburen in Rome on the decoration of the chapel of the Pietà in the church of San Pietro in Montorio (1617-20). Their pictures in the chapel were among the great works executed by Northern artists in Rome."
2217,"HAENSBERGEN, Johan van","(b. 1642, Gorinchem, d. 1705, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haensber/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and art dealer. He spent his childhood in Gorinchem, later on he moved to Utrecht, where he was apprentice of Cornelis van Poelenburgh. It is not known how long he remained in the workshop of his tutor, but he evidently worked closely in his master's style. It is known with certainty that he was signed in as a member of the Utrecht's painters' Guild of St Luke between 1668 and 1669."

In 1850 he returned to Belgium and studied with the landscape painter Joseph Quineaux (1822-1895). During his studies there and on his travels in France, Germany and Holland, he became acquainted with contemporary Realist trends."
2219,"HAFFNER, Enrico Giovanni","(b. 1640, Bologna, d. 1702, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haffner/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters of Swiss origin. The brothers Enrico Giovanni Haffner and Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) were renowned quadraturisti and fresco painters. They were the sons of a Swiss guard stationed in Bologna. The dynamic, flamboyant quality of their quadratura schemes, which they often executed in collaboration, reflected the Genoese Baroque style of the late 17th century and was in sharp contrast with the style of the brothers' Bolognese contemporaries. Opinion appears to credit Enrico with being superior in invention, Antonio Maria with being the better colourist."
2220,"HAGEMANN, Karl Friedrich",(1773-1806),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hagemann/biograph.html,"
German sculptor working in the Neo-Classical style. In 1802 he went to Rome and produced a number of mythological works at this time. While in Rome, Hagemann had been an associate of Thorvaldsen and had absorbed the ideal of heroic Classicism favoured by the circle that had formed around the German painter Asmus Jacob Carstens."
2221,"HAGEN, August Mathias","(b. 1794, Vijciems, d. 1878, Tartu)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hagen/biograph.html,"

2222,"HAGENAUER, Friedrich","(b. ca. 1495, Strasbourg, d. after 1546)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hagenaue/biograph.html,"
German wood-carver and medallist. He may have been the son of the sculptor Nikolaus Haguenauer. By his own account, he left Strasbourg soon after 1520 and worked in a number of cities, including Speyer, Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Nuremberg and Salzburg, but no works from this period have been found. Between 1525 and 1527, while living in Munich and Landshut, he executed some 20 medals portraying Duke William IV of Bavaria, Duke Ludwig X (examples in Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich) and Pfalzgraf Philipp, Bishop of Freising (example in Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) and members of the Munich court and bourgeoisie. He next moved to Augsburg, where in 1531 the guilds complained to the City Council that he was working as a wood-carver and counterfeiter (portrait sculptor) without being one of their members. Hagenauer replied that in other cities his work was recognized as free art and not subject to compulsory guild restrictions."
2223,"HAGUENAUER, Nikolaus",(recorded 1493-1526 in Strasbourg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haguenau/biograph.html,"
Nikolaus Haguenauer (Nikolaus von Hagenau), German sculptor, born in Haguenau, Alsace. In 1493 he became a citizen of Strasbourg, where he is last mentioned in 1526. Although three inscriptions with his name are documented, it is difficult to relate them to existing works, so attributions are based on stylistic analysis. Haguenauer is thought to have made the male half-length figure on the balustrade above the entrance to St Andrew's Chapel in the south transept of Strasbourg Cathedral. In 1500-01 he was commissioned to carve the Corpus Christi retable (dismantled 1682) for the high altar of the cathedral. Some parts survive, including the predella figures of a Lamentation (Strasbourg, College Episcopal St Etienne) and busts of two prophets (Strasbourg, Musée de l'Oevre Notre-Dame)."
2224,"HAINZ, Georg","(b. ca. 1630, Altona, d. 1688, Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hainz/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was the founder of still-life painting in Hamburg where he became a citizen by 1668. His earliest dated trompe l'oeil still-lifes are from 1665. In 1672, Hainz was in Leipzig, where he painted mainly portraits. After a lengthy trial with the Hamburger painters guild from 1667 to 1681, Hainz became an independent master in 1682. Joachim von Sandrart praised him as ""Meister in stilligenden Sachen"" (""master in motionless objects""). His students were Christian Berentz and Ernst Stuven."

While in Germany (1756-59) he studied miniature painting with Eichhardt in Berlin and with Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Richard (1725-70) in Hamburg. After this trip, he decided to become a professional portrait painter, and in 1759 he enrolled at the Kungliga Akademi för de Fria Konsterna in Stockholm, studying drawing with the French sculptor Pierre-Hubert Larchéveque (1721-78) and painting with Gustaf Lundberg. He attracted the attention of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, who in 1766 gained for him a commission for the pastel portrait of Princes Karl and Fredrik Adolf. In that year he also executed a miniature portrait of Crown Prince Gustav on the occasion of his engagement to Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark."
2227,"HALLÉ, Noël","(b. 1711, Paris, d. 1781, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/halle/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of artists. Daniel Hallé and his son Claude-Guy Hallé were active in Paris in the 17th century and the early 18th, chiefly as painters of religious scenes, and enjoyed high contemporary reputations. Claude-Guy's son Noël Hallé was one of the major French painters of the 18th century and received many commissions from the Crown, from the Church and from the city of Paris. His sister Marie-Anne Hallé (b. 1704) married the painter Jean Restout II, a nephew of Jean Jouvenet, in 1729. The family was thus part of a network of related artists who dominated the areas of history and religious painting in the early and middle decades of the 18th century.

Noël Hallé was a painter, draughtsman and printmaker. After studying architecture he became the pupil of his father and of his brother-in-law Jean Restout II. In 1736 he won the Prix de Rome, and he spent the period from 1737 to 1744 at the Académie de France in Rome. There he made a copy (untraced) of Raphael's Heliodorus Driven from the Temple (Rome, Vatican, Stanza d'Eliodoro), which he intended for a tapestry cartoon for the Gobelins, as well as executing drawings and engravings after antique monuments and works of art.

On his return to Paris, he was approved by the Académie Royale in 1746 and received (reçu) as a full member in 1748 on presentation of the Dispute of Minerva and Neptune over Choosing a Name for the City of Athens (Paris, Louvre). He became a professor at the Académie in 1755 and was named Surinspecteur de la Manufacture des Tapisseries de la Couronne at the Gobelins in 1770. In 1775 he was entrusted with the reorganization of the Académie de France in Rome, neglected by its aging director Charles-Joseph Natoire; he was rewarded for his efforts by ennoblement and the Order of St Michel. He was treasurer of the Académie Royale from 1776 to 1781 and became rector in the year of his death.



"
2228,"HALS, Dirck","(b. 1591, Haarlem, d. 1656, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hals/dirk/biograph.html,"
Dirck was the younger brother of Frans Hals who was probably also his teacher, but the painters who influenced Dirck were Esaias van de Velde and Willem Buytewech. Apart from a few portraits, he devoted himself exclusively to the painting of conversation pieces - the cheerful domestic life of prosperous burghers in their houses or gardens. He was not interested in the serious side of life; in his work he depicted people in conversation or while flirting, making music and dancing, eating and drinking. His interiors are hardly worked out, all the emphasis is put on fashionable dress and colourful representation. He succeeded in putting across people's high spirits through facial expression, costly dress, posture and loose grouping.

2229,"HALS, Frans","(b. 1580, Antwerpen, d. 1666, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hals/frans/biograph.html,"Frans Hals was the great 17th-century portraitist of the Dutch bourgeoisie of Haarlem, where he spent practically all his life. Hals evolved a technique that was close to impressionism in its looseness, and he painted with increasing freedom as he grew older. The jovial spirit of his early work is typified by the Shrovetide Revellers (Merry Company, c. 1615; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). In middle age his portraits grew increasingly sad, revealing sometimes a sense of foreboding (e.g., Nicolaes Hasselaer, 1630-33; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). The paintings of his old age show best his genius for portraying character (e.g., Man in a Slouch Hat, 1660-66; Staatliche Museen, Kassel).

2233,"HALSBACH, Jörg von","(d. 1488, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/halsbach/biograph.html,"
Jörg von Halsbach (also Halspach or Ganghofer), German architect. He was educated probably in Braunau or Wasserburg am Inn, where a strong tradition of late Gothic architecture had prevailed. In 1441 he was detected for the first time during reconstruction work on the choir of the monastery church in Ettal. He was also involved in the 1450 completed parish in Polling. Between 1479 and 1484 he was consulted to build the tower of the church in Hall in Tirol."
2234,"HAMEN, Juan van der","(b. 1596, Madrid, d. 1631, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamen/biograph.html,"
Juan van der Hamen y Leon was the son of a Flemish painter of still-life, Jan van der Hamen, and a Spanish mother. He was a major painter of 'bodegon' still-life and genre in a style still markedly Flemish. He was also the most important still-life painter at court in the early reign of Philip IV and a pioneer in the field of flower painting. Van der Hamen probably began painting floral arrangements in response to the flower pieces of Flemish artists, such as Jan ""Velvet"" Brueghel, who were regarded as exemplary masters in the field and whose works were much sought after in Spain."
2235,"HAMILTON, Johann Georg de","(b. 1672, Bruxelles, d. 1737, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamilto/johann/biograph.html,"
Johann Georg de Hamilton (also Johann George of Hamilton) was a Scottish still-life and animal painter. He was the son of James Hamilton of a Scottish noble family who emigrated to the Netherlands in 1666. In 1698 he settled in Vienna together with his brother Philipp Ferdinand, where in 1712 he was appointed court painter."
2236,"HAMILTON, John",(active 1750s in Vienna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamilto/john/biograph.html,"
John (Johann) Hamilton, Scottish painter, part of a family of court painters who specialized in still-life and animal scenes and worked in many prominent European courts, including that of Charles V and the House of Liechtenstein. He was the son of Philipp Ferdinand de Hamilton.

2238,"HAMILTON, Hugh Douglas","(b. ca. 1740, Dublin, d. 1808, Dublin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamiltoh/biograph.html,"
Irish painter, active in England and Italy. He trained under Robert West (active 1735-1770) at the Dublin Society's Drawing School, after which he moved to London in the early 1760s. There his skillfully executed pastel portraits attracted a large number of commissions from Irish and English sitters. Among his portraits of the royal family is that of Queen Charlotte (1769; Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin); many others are in the British Royal Collection."
2239,"HAMILTON, Gavin","(b. 1723, Lanark, d. 1798, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamilton/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, archaeologist, and picture-dealer, active mainly in Italy. He settled permanently in Rome in 1756, and was a leading member of the Neoclassical circle of Mengs and Winckelmann. His archaeological excavations near Rome resulted in many important additions to contemporary collections, and his interest in antiquity exerted a decisive influence on the young Canova. He was to know and encourage almost all the British artists who worked in Rome during the second half of the 18th century. Henry Fuseli, who was not an uncritical admirer, wrote of Hamilton in 1805, 'however eminent his talents or other qualities were, they were excelled by the liberality, benevolence and humanity of his character'."
2240,"HAMILTON, William","(b. 1751, London, d. 1801, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hamiltow/biograph.html,"

He studied under Antonio Zucchi (who was later Adam's chief decorative painter), possibly in Rome from 1766 and in London from 1768. At the Royal Academy Schools from 1769, Hamilton developed into a figure painter and exhibited portraits and subject pictures at the Royal Academy from 1774 to 1801. He became ARA in 1784 and RA in 1789. "

2243,"HANN, Sebestyén","(b. 1644, Lõcse, d. 1713, Nagyszeben)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hann/biograph.html,"
Hungarian silversmith. He worked in Nagyszeben (now Sibiu, Romania) from 1675 and made c. 100 works. His first commissions came from Saxon patricians in Transylvania: cups and chalices donated or offered as official gifts to different evangelical churches, and luxury objects, such as jugs, goblets and items of jewellery. The majority of the pieces combine figurative with decorative composition, and Hann based his ornamental repertory on Renaissance and Baroque styles. His preference for using historical and heroic themes on cups and goblets had as its source the engravings of Matthäus Merian (1593-1650). Another source was the engravings of Dürer, which inspired his design for the cup of rhinoceros horn (1694; Sibiu, Brukenthal Museum)."
2244,"HANNEMAN, Adriaen","(b. ca. 1603, Den Haag, d. 1671, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hanneman/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He came from a family of Catholic government officials. In 1619 he became a pupil of the portrait painter Anthonie van Ravesteyn (1580-1669), brother of Jan van Ravesteyn. Hanneman's only known early work is a Portrait of a Woman (1625; private collection), which is entirely in the style of the van Ravesteyn brothers. Around 1626 he settled in London, where he married Elizabeth Wilson in 1630. It is possible that Hanneman worked for some time as an assistant in the workshop of Anthony van Dyck, who settled in England in 1632. The few signed pieces that have been preserved from Hanneman's years in London, and his later paintings, show the strong influence of van Dyck's style of portraiture."
2245,"HANSCH, Anton","(b. 1813, Wien, d. 1876, Salzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hansch/biograph.html,"
Austrian landscape painter, who came from an old Viennese family. He studied at the Vienna Academy with the landscape painter Joseph Mössmer (1780-1845). From 1834 onwards, study tours, often with his friends, took him to the Alpine region."
2246,"HANSCHE, Jan Christiaen",(active 1651-1679),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hansche/biograph.html,"
Flemish stuccoist, active in the Southern Netherlands, Holland and Germany. His workshop developed an important turnover in various places in the Southern Netherlands and in the Rhineland. With a great feeling for detail and local colour both allegorical and mythological groups and biblical scenes were made for sacristies and monastery libraries: Sint-Carolus-Borromeuskerk, Antwerp (c. 1651); Premonstratensian Abbey, Park-Heverlee (1672-79); as well as for interiors in large country houses: Horst (1655); Beaulieu (1659); Modave (1666). All these stucco decorations are conspicuous for the same preference for lively pictorial contrasts of light and shade, which are also typical of monumental sculpture in marble and stone.

He had lessons in watercolour painting from Samuel Prout (1783-1852) and in 1816 he won the Society of Arts silver medal for landscape painting. He also learnt engraving from John Pye (1782-1874) and subsequently became a skilled engraver and lithographer. He was also largely engaged in teaching, counting John Ruskin amongst his pupils."

Austrian architect and inventor. Joseph Hardtmuth, Joseph Kornhäusel and Franz Engel were the architects of the princes of Liechtenstein. They created an architecture of follies, pavilions, miniature palaces and all the other accoutrements of an English garden in Feldsberg (Valtice) and Eisgrub (Lednice). The park was also a hunting ground, and this led to a whole series of buildings that were used during and after hunts."
2253,"HARLOW, George Henry","(b. 1787, London, d. 1819, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/harlow/biograph.html,"
English painter. After briefly attending Westminster School in London, he trained as a painter, first under Hendrik Frans de Cort (1742-1810), then under Samuel Drummond (1765-1844) and finally with Thomas Lawrence. Although Lawrence was paid a considerable sum to accept Harlow into his studio he did not formally teach him; instead he allowed the young man to copy and occasionally help with his work. After 18 months the two fell out and Harlow left to pursue his own career though the influence of Lawrence's style was lasting."

French painter and printmaker. He came from a prosperous, solidly bourgeois background. A precocious draughtsman, he received elementary art training at the municipal school and became a talented cellist who enjoyed playing the chamber music of Haydn and Beethoven in later life. His artistic career was delayed by employment in the family iron forges at Denain and at the Famars sugar refinery, although he drew caricatures under the influence of the great French satirical lithographers."
2256,"HARRISON, Peter","(b. 1716, York, d. 1775, New Haven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/harriso/biograph.html,"

Bohemian painter, the most important landscape painter in Bohemia in the early eighteenth century. Although little is known about his early training, he lived from 1702 in Prague, where he was able to study the collections of Rudolph II.

German painter. His artistic talent was recognized in 1827, while he was at school in Düsseldorf. The same year he embarked on a course in architecture at the Akademie in Düsseldorf. In 1828 he turned to the study of history painting. After a difference of opinion over the theory of art with the Director of the Akademie, Wilhelm von Schadow, Hasenclever went home to Remscheid.

Antoinette-Cécile-Hortense Haudebourt-Lescot, French painter. At the age of seven she became a pupil of Guillaume Lethière, a family friend and popular history painter who was appointed director of the Académie de France in Rome in 1807. She followed him to Rome in 1808 and remained there until 1816, depicting the customs and costumes of the Italian peasantry in veristic detail. This experience abroad, rare for a woman artist, was a decisive influence on her art which in its picturesque and anecdotal images of everyday Italian life prefigured the work of the later genre specialists. She regularly exhibited her work at the Paris Salon, showing some 110 paintings there between 1811 and 1840."
2266,"HAVERMAN, Margareta",(active 1715-1723),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haverman/biograph.html,"

Her father persuaded Jan van Huysum to take her on as a pupil, despite the secretive nature of the famous flower painter. She moved to Paris (about 1720?), married an architect, and in 1722 became a member of the Académie Royale. She was the second woman to be appointed to the Académie."
2267,"HAWKINS, Louis Welden","(b. 1849, Stuttgart, d. 1910, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hawkins/biograph.html,"
French painter, born in Germany. He was the son of a British naval officer and his Austrian wife, Louise Sopransi, Baroness von Welden.

2268,"HAWKSMOOR, Nicholas","(b. 1661, London, d. 1736, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hawksmoo/biograph.html,"
English architect. He was trained in the 1680s as architect under Sir Christopher Wren, whom he assisted later (from 1696 personally, and 1698 officially) in designing Greenwich Hospital (now the Royal Naval College). He collaborated with Sir John Vanbrugh on Castle Howard (first design: 1699) and Blenheim Palace (begun 1705). He was appointed clerk of works at Kensington Palace in 1689. He was replaced by Henry Jones in 1715, but received the senior clerkship to the palaces of Whitehall, Westminster, and Saint James's in the same year."
2269,"HAYDON, Benjamin Robert","(b. 1786, Plymouth, d. 1846, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/haydon/biograph.html,"
English painter, who aspired to bring a new seriousness to British art through historical and religious work in the Grand Manner preached by Reynolds. His life was a story of bombastic frustration and intransigent opposition to the establishment (particularly the Royal Academy), fighting continuously for personal recognition and arguing for the social purpose of art."
2270,"HAYET, Louis","(b. 1864, Pontoise, d. 1940, Cormeilles-en-Parisis)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hayet/biograph.html,"
French painter and writer. He was the son of a dealer in stained glass and other decorations in Pontoise. He was largely self-taught and initially earned his living as an itinerant painter-decorator. In 1881 he met Lucien and Camille Pissarro while painting landscapes near Pontoise and through them met Paul Signac in 1885 and Seurat in 1886. After a year's military service at Versailles, Hayet moved to Paris in the autumn of 1887. There he began to apply to his paintings Eugène Chevreul's theories of colour contrast with which he had become familiar by 1881. A gifted watercolour painter, he also experimented with the ancient technique of wax encaustic, painting on a prepared cotton that allowed light to filter through. The paint surface of works such as The Grange (private collection) retains a vivid tonal freshness, while the subject of crowds of peasants gathered before the Paris agricultural market reveals a debt to Pissarro."
2271,"HAYEZ, Francesco","(b. 1791, Venezia, d. 1882, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hayez/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active mainly in Milan. Hayez was the most important figure in the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism in Italian painting, but his Romantic leanings come out mainly in subject-matter rather than in technique, the clear outlines he favoured revealing his training in Rome in the circle of Canova and Ingres. He painted religious, historical, and mythological works in a vein owing something to Delacroix and Delaroche, and portraits that are sometimes thought worthy of comparison with those of Ingres. Many of the most eminent Italians of the day sat for him. For many years he taught at the Brera in Milan (he became Director in 1860) and he exercised great influence on his pupils. The Brera has an outstanding collection of his work.



"
2272,"HAYTER, George","(b. 1792, London, d. 1871, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hayter/biograph.html,"
English painter and printmaker. He was the son of Charles Hayter (1761-1835), miniature painter, author of manuals for art instruction and Professor of Perspective and Drawing to Princess Charlotte. In 1808 George entered the Royal Academy Schools, and in 1815 was appointed Painter of Miniatures and Portraits by Princess Charlotte. Hayter was awarded the British Institution's premium for history painting for the Prophet Ezra (1815; Downton Castle, Herefordshire), purchased by Richard Payne Knight. Encouraged by his patron, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, he travelled to Italy to study in 1816, gaining election as an honorary member of the Accademia di S Luca in Florence."

Flemish painter and etcher. He was born in Kwaremont near Oudenaarde, Flanders, moved to Antwerp at an early age, where he worked as an apprentice in the workshop of the little-known painter Abraham Hack (active 1623-1638 in Antwerp) for two years. In 1642 he became a member of the guild of St Luke. After spending some time in Italy and Brussels in the 1650's, in 1659 van den Hecke settled definitively in Antwerp. He married and fathered at least three children; his son, Jan van den Hecke II (born 1661), also became a successful still-life painter."
2277,"HEDA, Willem Claesz.",(1593/94-1680/82),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heda/biograph.html,"

Heda's earliest dated work is a Vanitas (1621; The Hague, Museum Bredius), which shows a still-life from a high viewpoint, composed of various objects bearing vanitas associations (e.g. a bowl of glowing embers, smoker's requisites, an overturned glass and a skull); the colouring is in brownish-grey tones and represents one of the earliest examples of a Dutch monochrome still-life ('monochrome' refers to the range of tones, rather than of colours). Even in this early work Heda's skill at painting textures is evident. A more balanced composition is achieved in another Still-life (1629; The Hague, Mauritshuis) and in the Breakfast Table (1631; Dresden, Gemäldegalerie), in both of which the objects, set against a neutral background, are linked by a strong diagonal. In 1631 he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St Luke (of which he served as deacon on several occasions after 1637)."
2278,"HEEM, Cornelis de","(b. 1631, Leiden, d. 1695, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heem/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of Jan Davidsz(oon) de Heem (1606-1684), one of the greatest Baroque painters of still life in Holland whose most numerous and characteristic works are arrangements of fruits, metal dishes, and wine glasses; compositions of books and musical instruments; and examples of the popular ""vanity of life"" theme, with such symbolic articles as skulls and hourglasses. Cornelis de Heem, was not quite the equal of Jan, but many of his paintings are preserved in museums in The Hague, Vienna, and elsewhere. Jan's younger brother, David Davidsz. de Heem, and Jan's eldest son, David Jansz. de Heem, were also well-known painters.



"
2279,"HEEM, David Cornelisz. de","(b. 1663, Antwerpen, d. 1701, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heem/david/biograph.html,"

2280,"HEEM, Jan Davidsz. de","(b. 1606, Utrecht, d. 1684, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heem/jan/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter. He was born at Utrecht and his rare early pictures are in the style of Balthasar van der Ast, who taught him there. Later he worked in Leiden and showed that he had studied the restrained and simple works of the Haarlem still-life artists Claesz. and Heda. In 1636 he moved to Antwerp, became a citizen of that city in 1637, and spent most of his very productive life there. The paintings he did in Flanders are the ones for which he is most renowned and are very different in spirit from his earlier works: splendid flower pieces and large compositions of exquisitely laid tables which breathe all the opulent exuberance of Flemish Baroque painting. His work formed a link between the Dutch and Flemish still-life traditions and he is claimed by both schools. He came from a large family of painters and his many followers in Flanders and Holland included his son Cornelis (1631-95).

Dutch painter and draughtsman, active also in England. He is said to have been a pupil of Pieter de Grebber. In 1653 and 1655 he was living in Haarlem, and on 24 May 1655 he was on the point of leaving for Italy. Thereafter he lived mostly in Amsterdam (1661, 1665 and 1669); in between he also spent periods near The Hague (1663) and in Weesp (1667). On 26 June 1674 he was still in Holland. He then moved to England, where he lived in London as well as Oxford."

Dutch painter, son of a painter of the same name. He later became an actor. Attempts to distinguish the work of father and son have not yet been successful.

2283,"HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van","(b. 1498, Heemskerk, d. 1574, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heemsker/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, worked with Scorel in Haarlem 1527-29 and learned most of the Italianate manner from him before going to Italy in 1532 himself. Before he left he gave his St Luke Painting the Virgin to the Haarlem Guild (now in Haarlem, Hals Museum); this is almost a parody of the Italian manner, as conceived by a Northerner at second hand."
2284,"HEEMSKERK, Willem Jacobsz. van","(b. 1613, Leiden, d. 1693, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heemskex/biograph.html,"
Dutch glass engraver. Like his father before him he became a merchant. After his textile business went bankrupt he was offered prestigious positions in various guilds. Besides his work, he also wrote poems and taught himself calligraphy and applied his talent in this direction to glass as well as paper. As a master calligrapher and glass engraver he was exceptionally productive and decorated drinking glasses, bottles and glass bowls.



"
2285,"HEEREMANS, Thomas","(b. ca. 1640, Haarlem, d. 1694, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heereman/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of landscapes and panoramas. He was admitted to the guild in Haarlem in 1664, where he was a pupil of Caesar van Everdingen. No influence of the classicist van Everdingen can be found in the work of Heeremans, by whom no figure studies are known today. However, his style, particularly notable in his depiction of river scenes, is very much influenced by the slightly older Haarlem landscape painter Klaes Molenaer, though Heeremans brings a greater vibrancy both in palette and movement to the rather melancholic scenes of Molenaer."
2286,"HEERMANN, Paul","(b. 1673, Weigmannsdorf, d. 1732, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heermann/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. He worked with his uncle George Heermann on the allegorical sculptures for Troja Castle in Prague, a period of work that was interrupted by a stay in Rome around 1700. Heermann is known to have been in Dresden after the completion of these sculptures in 1705; while there he would have seen works by Guillaume Coustou the Elder and Francois Coudray. As a co-worker in Dresden with Balthasar Permoser he was involved in making the sculptures for the Zwinger, and created a number of other high-quality pieces in the city, not least for the GroBer Garten. He executed a marble bust of Augustus II of Poland c. 1718. Of particular interest in connection with this bust is a bronzed plaster model Heermann made for an equestrian statue of Augustus the Strong, showing him mounted on a rearing horse (Skulpturensammlung, Dresden).



"
2287,"HEFELE, Melchior","(b. 1716, Kaltenbrunn, d. 1794, Szombathely)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hefele/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect (Hefele Menyhért in Hungary). He was first trained as a carpenter and architectural draftsman. Around 1734 he worked with the episcopal master Johann Georg Oegg (1703-1780) in Würzburg. Then he moved to Vienna, where he won a first prize and the Golden Medal for Architecture in 1742 at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was an instructor of the Hungarian bodyguard of Maria Theresa and since 1756 he had the title of a k. u. k. Builder."
2288,"HEIDELOFF, Josef","(b. 1743, Mainz, d. 1830, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heidelof/biograph.html,"
Josef Heideloff II was a German painter and etcher, active in Austria. He was the son of the painter Joseph  Heideloff I from Mainz. Around 1750 his father took him to Vienna, where he studied under Johann Christian Brand at the Vienna Academy. He produced a number of architectural views and landscape veduta of Lower Austria which are very interesting from a topographical point of view. He preferred the medium of gouache.



"
2289,"HEIL, Daniel van","(b. 1604, Bruxelles, d. 1662, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heil/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. As a landscapist he had a great reputation; but he discontinued those subjects for those of terror, such as conflagrations of cities, villages, or palaces; which he represented with truth and exactness. The pictures of this master are very frequent, and some of them are extremely well coloured, and freely and firmly pencilled."
2290,"HEIM, François-Joseph","(b. 1787, Belfort, d. 1865, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heim/biograph.html,"
French historical painter. He began to draw when eight years old, and gained the first prize for drawing in Strasbourg before he was eleven. In 1803 he entered the studio of Vincent at Paris. In 1807 he obtained the first prize at the Academy with a picture of Theseus and the Minotaur, and a travelling scholarship with which he went to Rome. In 1812 he received a gold medal of the Academy for his painting The Return of Jacob (Musée de Bordeaux). In 1824 he received the Legion of Honour. He became full member of the Academy in 1829, and professor in 1831. He was appointed painter to the Institute of France, and exhibited over sixty portraits of members, the drawings for which are now in the Louvre. "
2291,"HEIMBACH, Wolfgang","(b. ca. 1615, Ovelgönne, d. after 1678)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heimbach/biograph.html,"
German painter. The son of a bookkeeper at the corn exchange, he was known because of a disability as 'the Ovelgönne mute'. An aristocratic sponsor, probably Graf Anton Günther (1603-1667) of Oldenburg, sent him to train in the Netherlands: stylistic considerations would suggest that this was in the 1630s. The Evening Scene (1637, private collection) shows him adapting the style of Caravaggio as practiced in Utrecht to the kind of social gathering depicted by Dirck Hals or Anthonie Palamedesz. He uses an artificial light source to exaggerate the modelling of the figures and the space. This characteristic of his art also shows in the Evening Banquet of 1640 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which might represent a stop on a southward journey to Italy: works from this time suggest contact with southern Germany and Austria."
2292,"HEINTZ, Joseph the Elder","(b. 1564, Basle, d. 1609, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heintz/joseph_e/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter, draughtsman, architect and artistic adviser, member of a family of artists, son of Daniel Heintz, an architect-mason."
2293,"HEINTZ, Joseph the Younger","(b. ca. 1600, Augsburg, d. ca. 1678, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heintz/joseph_y/biograph.html,"
Painter and etcher, member of a Swiss/German family of artists, the son of the noted Prague court painter by the same name, with whose style and choice of subject-matter, however, his work has little in common. The younger Heintz apparently left for Venice at an early age; he spent the rest of his life there. Although Heintz painted a large number of historical or religious pictures, in Venice he started painting scenes of popular festivals, cast in urban settings that usually dominate the actual events. He had at his disposal a long, local tradition of festive and ceremonial imagery that had blossomed during the sixteenth century in the form of prints and paintings. Excellent examples are the works commemorating the official entry of the Polish king Henry III into Venice in 1574 and the coronation of Doge Marino Grimani and his wife in 1595."
2294,"HEISS, Johann","(b. 1640, Memmingen, d. 1704, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heiss/biograph.html,"
German painter and draughtsman. He was apprenticed first to Johann Friedrich Sichelbein (c. 1625-90), then in Augsburg to Johann Heinrich Schönfeld, whose style fundamentally determined his own. He was also influenced by Joseph Werner and French Baroque painters, and the knowledge of Italian landscape and architecture evident in his pictures suggests an Italian journey or the influence of an artist recently returned from Italy.



"
2295,"HELLEU, Paul-César","(b. 1859, Vannes, d. 1927, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helleu/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. In 1870 he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he studied under Jean-Léon Gérôme, a pupil of Ingres. He proudly described himself as 'the grandson of Ingres' and advocated that artists should 'always be classical'. He quickly formed a group of close friends including Sargent, Degas, Whistler, Alfred Stevens and Giovanni Boldini. As a student he was very poor and to earn a living spent 10 years decorating plates for the potter Joseph-Théodore Deck. In 1885 he visited London with Gérôme to paint a panorama (untraced). This was the start of a lifelong affection for England, where he returned almost every year."
2296,"HELMAN, Isidore-Stanislaus-Henri","(b. 1743, Lille, d. ca. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helman/biograph.html,"
French engraver and printseller. He was among the first students of the drawing academy of Lille, where he studied under the direction of Louis-Jean Guèret and Louis-Joseph Watteau before joining the Parisian studio of Jacques-Philippe Lebas (1707-1783). He was a member of the Académie des Arts in Lille."
2297,"HELMONT, Mattheus van","(b. 1623, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1679, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helmont/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, a pupil of David Teniers the Younger. He was a member of Antwerp's guild of painters by 1646. His abundant production, generally signed or monogrammed, but seldom dated, spreads out between 1638 and 1670. Influenced greatly by his master and Adriaen Brouwer, van Helmont specialized in the painting of genre subjects, particularly village scenes, kermesses and interiors, but also produced still-lifes and several versions of The Temptation of St Anthony. In addition, he painted Italian markets and fairs, which suggests he visited Italy at some point in his career."
2298,"HELMONT, Zeger Jacob van","(b. 1683, Antwerpen, d. 1726, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helmont1/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and tapestry designer who specialized in portraits and history paintings. He trained with his history and portrait painter father Jan van Helmont (1650-c. 1730) in Antwerp but spent his active career in Brussels where he worked for the local churches and tapestry works. He joined the local Guild of Saint Luke in Brussels."
2299,"HELST, Bartholomeus van der","(b. 1613, Haarlem, d. 1670, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helst/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. he was born in Haarlem, settled in Amsterdam in 1636, and in the 1640s took over from Rembrandt as the most popular portraitist in the city, his detailed, tasteful, and slightly flattering likenesses appealing more to the fashionable burghers than the master's work, which was becoming more individual and introspective. Van der Helst's influence during his lifetime was great. For example, Rembrandt's talented pupils Bol and Flinck abandoned the style of their master in order to follow his more popular manner. His reputation endured into the next century and as late as 1782 Reynolds wrote that van der Helst's Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster 'is, perhaps, the first picture of portraits in the world', adding that it as far exceeded  his expectations as Rembrandt's Night Watch fell below them.



"
2300,"HELT STOCKADE, Nicolaes van","(b. 1614, Nijmegen, d. 1669, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/helt_sto/biograph.html,"

"
2301,"HEMESSEN, Caterina van","(b. 1528, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1587, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hemessen/caterina/biograph.html,"
Daughter of Jan Sanders van Hemessen. Both Vasari and Guicciardini mention her, along with the illuminators Levina Teerlinc, Susanna Horenbout and others, as a prominent Netherlandish woman painter. According to van Beverwyck, she studied painting under her father. She acknowledged filial respect by signing an aristocratic Portrait of a Man (National Gallery, London): Catharina filia Ioannes de Hemessen Pingebat 1552. The suggestion that Catharina painted background scenes for some of her father's pictures (Bergmans) is unacceptable on both stylistic and chronological grounds."
2302,"HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van","(b. ca. 1500, Hemishem, d. 1556, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hemessen/jan/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter of religious and genre scenes and portraits. The facts of his life are obscure, but in 1524 he was made a master of the Antwerp Guild. He is reputed to have moved to Haarlem c.1550 and to have died there. His paintings illustrating popular proverbs and religious parables, and his satirical portraits, link him with Quentin Massys and Marinus van Reymerswale, and Hemessen ranks with them as one of the founders of Flemish genre painting. An example of his work is The Prodigal Son (Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1536).



"
2303,"HEMMEL VON ANDLAU, Peter","(active 1447, d. ca. 1501)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hemmel/biograph.html,"
German glass painter, born in Andlau, Alsace. His commissions and influence extended from the area around Strasbourg into southern Germany and Austria. Hemmel became a citizen of Strasbourg through marriage in 1447 with the widow of a local glass painter named Heinz. His work shows figure types similar to contemporary engravings, in particular those of Martin Schongauer; Hemmel's Adoration of the Magi in the Nonnbergkirche, Salzburg, is derived from a Schongauer print of the same subject. Distinctive among his many commissions are the Kramer window (1479-80) in Ulm Minster and the axial choir window of St Anne and the Virgin (c. 1478-79) in the Stiftskirche, Tübingen. The balance of the intense purple, scarlet and deep blue against extensive silver-stain yellow and white glass creates a tension between spatial planes. Hemmel's draughtsmanship in his Virgin and Child with Lily from the Nonnbergkirche, Salzburg (c. 1470-80; Darmstadt, Hessisches Landesmuseum), shows a sculptural treatment of drapery and form that dominates the composition. The extraordinarily lush treatment of the architectural frame, often developed through sprouting and intertwining branches, seen especially in large-scale work, is one of Hemmel's most distinctive contributions."
2304,"HENNINGSEN, Frants Peter Diderik","(b. 1851, København, d. 1908, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hennings/biograph.html,"
Danish painter and illustrator. After graduating from Borgerdyd School in Christianshavn, he attended Christian Vilhelm Nielsen's (1833-1910) drawing school and then the Danish Academy where he successfully completed his studies in 1875. From 1877 to 1878, he studied at Léon Bonnat's school in Paris. In 1878, he travelled to Spain together with Peder Severin Krøyer, Frans Schwartz (1850-1917) and Julius Lange (1817-1878). From 1874 he exhibited virtually every year at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition held at the Charlottenborg Palace. He was appointed as a professor at the Danish Academy in 1887."
2305,"HENRIQUES, Francisco",(active 1502-1518),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/henrique/biograph.html,"
Painter probably of south Netherlandish origin, active in Portugal. His art shows both south and north Netherlandish influences. He would have known the great series of Netherlandish panels depicting the Life of the Virgin (1500) painted for the high altar of Évora Cathedral (Évora, Museu Évora), on which he may have collaborated."
2306,"HENSTENBURGH, Herman","(b. 1667, Hoorn, d. 1726, Hoorn)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/henstenb/biograph.html,"

2307,"HÉRÉ DE CORNY, Emmanuel","(b. 1705, Nancy, d. 1763, Lunéville)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/here/biograph.html,"
French architect. He became court architect to Stanis³aw Leszczyñski, the last duke of Lorraine and father-in-law to the French king. Héré de Corny almost single-handedly designed all the important buildings and monuments in Nancy, he is best known for laying out the town centre of Nancy, a principal example of urban design in the 18th century."
2308,"HERIGOYEN, Emanuel Joseph von","(b. 1746, Belas, Lisboa, d. 1817, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/herigoye/biograph.html,"
Portuguese architect, active in Germany. He designed the gardens at Schönbusch, near Aschaffenburg, in the English style, and built there a pavilion in an early Neoclassical style (1778-79). He was responsible for the staircase at Aschaffenburg Schloss, and designed the churches at Esselbach (1779) and Sulzbach-am-Main (1786). Later, at Regensburg, he built the Theatre (1804, destroyed 1849), the circular Kepler Memorial (1808), and other works. In Munich he designed the Volkstheater (destroyed), the Greek Revival entrance to the Botanical Gardens (1812), and the Palais Montgelas (1810-11).

Spanish sculptor and architect. In 1553 he was apprenticed in the studio in Avila of Juan Bautista Vázquez, whom he accompanied to Seville in 1561. There, before 1568, he married the daughter of the architect Hernán Ruiz II. In 1573 he was examined in the art of the sculptor and architect ('arte de escultor y entallador al romano y arquitecto')."
2311,"HERP, Willem van, the Elder","(b. ca. 1614, Antwerpen, d. 1677, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/herp/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He trained from 1625 to 1629 with Damiaan Wortelmans (b 1588/89) and Hans Biermans, both minor painters, and eventually, perhaps after spending some time abroad, became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1637-38. From at least 1651 he worked for Matthijs Musson, the Antwerp art dealer. From the considerable quantity of surviving works, it appears that he must have worked on a semi-industrial basis to supply the art market. The majority of his paintings are religious scenes, fairly small in size, often painted on copper and existing in more than one version (e.g. St Anthony of Padua Distributing Bread, London, National Gallery). Often they are copies or pastiches of compositions by Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck or by history painters of the second rank, such as Gerard Seghers and Jan Boeckhorst. Van Herp also collaborated with other artists, such as Jacques d'Arthois, Dirck van Delen, and David Teniers the Younger, painting staffage in their works."

Francisco Herrera  the Elder (c.1590-1656), Spanish painter and engraver, a representative of the transition from Mannerism to Baroque. With his older contemporary Roelas, under whose influence he developed, he helped to prepare the way for the new naturalistic style of the School of Seville in the early 17th century. St Basil Dictating his Rule (Louvre, Paris), which is generally considered his masterpiece, shows his work at its most bold and vigorous. About 1638 Herrera moved to Madrid, where he died. According to Palomino, Diego Velázquez was Herrera's pupil, but if this was so it could only have been for a short time."

Spanish architect, mathematician and geometrician. One of the most outstanding Spanish architects in the 16th century, Herrera represents the peak of the Renaissance in Spain. His sober style was fully developed in buildings like the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. The Herrerian style was named after him, and was representative of the architecture of the Spanish Empire of Philip II and his Austrian successors."
2315,"HERREYNS, Willem","(b. 1743, Antwerpen, d. 1827, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/herreyns/biograph.html,"
Willem (Guillaume-Jacques) Herreyns, Flemish painter and teacher. Because his work continued the tradition of 17th-century Flemish painting, he has long been considered as the last of the school of Rubens and opposed to innovative trends. However, although it is true that most of his religious works remained faithful to the traditionalist mainstream, his friendship with Andries Cornelis Lens and Jan Cardon, his teaching and his political ideas all show open-mindedness towards new ideas.

English painter, part of a family of painters. He was the youngest of six children born to John Frederick Herring the Elder. Like his siblings, Benjamin received all of his training from his father and concentrated his efforts on sporting paintings. Though his style is very similar to the rest of his family - with a realistic rendition of the horse and fluidity of movement - his choice of coloration is quite different. -Instead of the deep rich tones so prevalent in the palettes of other members of the Herring family, Benjamin favoured a more pastel one."

English painter, part of a family of painters of Dutch descent. John Frederick the Elder was the most prolific and financially successful member of the family. His brother, Benjamin Herring (1806-1830) had a brief career largely devoted to producing passable imitations of the work of several early 19th-century sporting painters. John Frederick the Elder had seven surviving children, three of whom became artists: John Frederick the Younger, Charles (1828-1856), and Benjamin."
2318,"HERRING, John Frederick the Younger","(b. ca. 1820, Doncaster, d. 1907, Doncaster)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/herring/john_y/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters, son of John Frederick Herring the Elder. His father, at that time, was considered one of England's greatest sporting and equestrian artists and was therefore patronized by the English aristocracy. His mastery of the brush and popularity among the nobles served his son well."
2319,"HERWIJCK, Steven van","(b. ca. 1530, Utrecht, d. ca. 1565, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/herwijck/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish medallist. Although he was a skilled artist, his identity was not discovered until 1921. For many years the initials with which he signed his works were thought to stand for 'Stephen of Holland', a misconception that arose from speculation by George Vertue. His earliest medals, such as those depicting George van Egmond and Engelken Tols, date from 1558, when he was working in his native town."

Willem Hesius (Willem van Hees), a Jesuit priest, was a Flemish architect. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1617. After completing his religious training, he began his career as a teacher, but he was especially noted as a distinguished Latin speaker and preacher. For twenty years he directed the Latin sodality of Brussels and obtained the post for preacher assigned to the court of Archduke Leopold."
2321,"HESS, Heinrich Maria von","(b. 1798, Düsseldorf, d. 1863, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hess/heinrich/biograph.html,"
German painter. After training (1813-17) under Peter von Langer (1756-1824) at the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Munich, he painted religious subjects under the influence of Peter Cornelius. In 1821 he joined the Lukasbrüder, and the circle around Crown Prince Ludwig I of Bavaria, in Rome. Apollo among the Muses (1824; Munich, Neue Pinakothek), painted for Maximilian I, shows Hess to be among the most gifted of the German artists working in Rome. The influence of Raphael, glowing but carefully harmonized colours, gliding figures and drapery animate this early masterpiece. Among other important works from this time are exquisitely detailed and colouristically sophisticated, intimate character portraits with early Renaissance settings, such as that of Marchesa Marianna Florenzi (1824; Munich, Neue Pinakothek), as well as fresh and lively Naturalist landscapes from the environs of Rome, for example Campagna Landscape near Ponte Nomentano (1821-26; Hamburg, Kunsthalle)."
2322,"HESS, Peter von","(b. 1792, Düsseldorf, d. 1871, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hess/peter/biograph.html,"
German painter, known for his genre and history paintings. At the age of 15, he and his younger brother Heinrich left Dusseldorf with their family and came to Munich. There he studied at the Academy from 1809 to 1814, soon however distancing himself from supporters of the classical."
2323,"HETSCH, Philipp Friedrich von","(b. 1758, Stuttgart, d. 1838, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hetsch/biograph.html,"
German painter, part of a German/Danish family of painters and architects. At the age of 13, against the wishes of his parents who intended him to become a court musician like his father Christian Heinrich, Hetsch entered the Ducal Military Academy (Herzogliche Militärakademie or 'Karlsakademie') to train as an artist. The Militärakademie incorporated the Académie des Arts, founded by the court painter Nicolas Guibal (1725-1784) in 1761 on the model of the French Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Its training was wide-ranging, and, in response to the literary requirements then demanded of history painters, included such subjects as French, Italian and Latin, the history of art, mythology and the natural sciences. Hetsch's practical training, under Guibal, a history painter, and to a lesser extent the landscapist Friedrich Harper (1725-1806), was marked by the eclecticism of the transition between late Baroque and Rococo, and the more up-to-date Neo-classical style. This informed, and in part hindered, his entire career as a painter. He also studied with Joseph-Marie Vien in Paris in 1780-82, and he met Jacques-Louis David in Paris in 1783."

Dutch painter. He received painting lessons from his uncle Willem de Heusch, one of the Italianate painters. In January 1675 he is mentioned for the first time as a member of the Schildersbent, an association formed by Netherlandish artists in Rome. Though it is not known how long lie remained in the Eternal City, we may assume it was quite a while, because he is still mentioned in Venice in 1696 - working for Secretary Lucatelli - and because the Italian motifs in his work all come from Rome and its surroundings. By 1699 the artist had returned to Utrecht, where he died two years later."
2326,"HEUSCH, Willem de","(b. 1625, Utrecht, d. 1692, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heusch/willem/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher. cousin and teacher of Jacob de Heusch. Willem de Heusch specialized in Italianate landscapes in the style of Jan Both with whom he is likely to have trained. He is thought to have traveled in Italy around 1640, but was back in Utrecht by 1649 where he is recorded as a dean of the Guild along with Both and Cornelis Poelenburgh.

Flemish painter. To judge by the large number of paintings by him which have survived, Anton van den Heuvel must be considered the most successful representative of Ghent Caravaggism. In the declaration he made when he was admitted as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Ghent in 1628, he stated that in the previous 10 years he had been working in Antwerp and Rome."
2329,"HEYDEN, Jan van der","(b. 1637, Gorinchem, d. 1712, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/heyden/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam. He painted some landscapes and still-lifes, but is celebrated as one of the greatest of all townscape painters. His views of towns are done with loving attention to detail, but the harmonious colours and sunny light of his elegantly composed pictures prevent the precise way he rendered foliage, bricks, and architectural detail from appearing dull or dry. In spite of the seemingly objective nature of his work, van der Heyden often took liberties with topographical accuracy and he also painted 'capricci'. Painting was only a part of his activity. for he was also involved in civic administration in Amsterdam. The fire hose is said to have been his invention and it is included in his Brandspuiten-boek ('Fire Engine Book'), a volume about fire-fighting equipment, illustrated with his own engravings, that he published in 1690.

From the mid-1550s to about 1570 he worked for the publisher Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp, who was among the earliest print publishers in the Netherlands. Pieter van der Heyden produced more than 150 prints for the Cock publishing house, reproducing the designs of Bosch, Bruegel and other Flemish artists such as Hans Bol, Frans Floris and Lambert Lombard.

Norwegian painter. He was born into an enlightened but conservative family, his father being an engineer, occasional architect and writer of Nordic saga poetry, and he spent his childhood and youth in the rapidly expanding town of Drammen, 40 km from the capital Christiania (now Oslo). In 1873 he was admitted to the Kongelige Tegneskole in Christiania, where he studied under Peder C. Thurmann, a landscape artist trained in Düsseldorf. For more advanced training, Heyerdahl was obliged to go abroad, and in 1874 he enrolled at the Munich Akademie. He was encouraged by Professor Ludwig von Löfftz (1845-1910) to give up landscape in favour of history painting and portraits (e.g. the artists Christian Skredsvig, 1876, and Eilif Peterssen, 1877; both Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo)."

Tomás Hiepes (Yepes), Spanish painter. He is recorded as living and working in Valencia from 1643, achieving local fame in his lifetime for his still-life and flower paintings. In a comparatively early pair of small still-lifes with figs and grapes, signed and dated 1649 (both Madrid, Prado), the fruits are delicately painted and depicted with an almost botanical exactitude reminiscent of still-lifes from northern Europe. Hiepes's last known work, Still-life with Basket of Bread (1668, Madrid, Prado), typifies the style he used for large and elaborate pictures. It is characterized by studied effects of strong, direct lighting and pronounced shadows. Although the painting recalls contemporary Neapolitan still-lifes in subject-matter and composition, Hiepes's careful depiction of the details of objects and his meticulous technique contrast with the broad brushwork of Neapolitan artists and his Valencian contemporary Miguel March."
2335,"HIGHMORE, Joseph","(b. 1692, London, d. 1780, Canterbury)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/highmore/biograph.html,"
English painter, mainly of portraits. He studied at Kneller's Academy and had a considerable practice as a portraitist by the 1720s. His early work is in the manner of Richardson, but from the 1730s his portraits became more elegant as he responded to the Rococo influences that began to pervade English painting at this time. Some of his more informal works, however, have a directness and freshness that recall Hogarth (Mr. Oldham and Friends, Tate Gallery, London)."

2338,"HILDEBRANDT, Eduard","(b. 1818, Danzig, d. 1869, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hildebra/biograph.html,"
German painter. He first studied painting in Danzig as his father had done and in 1838 he went to Berlin, where he was refused admission at the Akademie der Künste by Johann Gottfried Schadow because of insufficient artistic talent. He then became a pupil of the marine painter Wilhelm Krause (1803-1864). In 1840 he undertook study trips to Scandinavia, England and Scotland, and the following year he went to Paris. He spent six months in the studio of Eugene Isabey, learning his technique of painting in watercolour. This was a formative period for his artistic development, and Isabey's influence would persist in his later oils and watercolours. While in Paris he painted mainly landscapes but also harbour scenes and seascapes."

Veit Hirschvogel the Elder, the son of a glazier named Heinz (d. 1485), established the family workshop and became the city's official glazier. His son Veit Hirschvogel the Younger (1485-1553) succeeded him as official glazier, being succeeded in his turn by his son Sebald Hirschvogel (1517-89), who remained in the post for 33 years. The brothers of Veit the Younger, Hans Hirschvogel (d. 1516) and Augustin Hirschvogel, also joined the glass-painting workshop, but Augustin, the most talented of the family, left it in 1525 to pursue a varied career outside Nuremberg, producing many etchings and also innovations in cartography. It is supposed that the Viennese goldsmith Veit Hirschvogel (1543-74) was Augustin's son."

In 1772 he gained a Society of Arts premium, and in that year came to London to study at the Royal Academy. In 1776 he visited Rome, and there studied under Mengs, together with Fuseli and Northcote (1746-1831). On returning to England in 1780 he painted for some time, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1781 and 1782. He ceased to exhibit after 1785. He was well-known for his portraits and historical scenes.

William Hoare of Bath, English painter and printmaker, part of a family of artists. He received a gentleman's education in Faringdon, Berks. Showing a marked aptitude for drawing, he was sent to London to study under Giuseppe Grisoni (1699-1769), who had left Florence for London in 1715. When Grisoni returned to Italy in 1728, Hoare went with him, travelling to Rome and continuing his studies under the direction of Francesco Fernandi. He remained in Rome for nine years, returning to London in 1737. He failed to establish himself there and settled in Bath, an expanding spa town with a constant influx of visitors eager for portraits, whose needs he met by producing pastels influenced by Rosalba Carriera."

2349,"HOBBEMA, Meyndert","(b. 1638, Amsterdam, d. 1709, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hobbema/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape painter. He worked in his native Amsterdam, where he was the friend and only documented pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael. Some of his pictures are very like Ruisdael's, but his range was more limited and he lacked the latter's power to capture the majesty of nature. He painted a narrow range of favourite subjects — particularly water-mills and trees around a pool — over and over again. In 1668 he became a wine gauger with the Amsterdam customs and excise, and thereafter seems to have painted only in his spare time. However, his most famous work, The Avenue at Middelharnis (National Gallery, London), dates from 1689. Hobbema has long been a popular artist in England (his influence is clear in Gainsborough's early landscapes) and he is outstandingly well represented in English collections.

English landscape painter and engraver. He first attended classes at William Shipley's Academy in the Strand, London, and from 1758 to 1765 was apprenticed to Richard Wilson (about whom he published a short biographical essay in 1790). Hodges followed Wilson's classical landscape style periodically throughout his career, but his work took on a more personal character when he travelled as draughtsman with Captain Cook in 1772-75, and his finest paintings are those based on drawings he made of such exotic Pacific islands as Tahiti and Easter Island (examples are in the National Maritime Museum, London). In 1779-84 he was in India and in 1790 he visited the Continent, going as far as Russia. He did pictures for Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery and also some allegorical subjects, but in 1795 he abandoned painting and opened a bank in Dartmouth. It failed shortly before he died.

He may have received his first training with his father, the Antwerp painter Caspar van den Hoecke (active 1595-1648), who also taught his half-brother Robert van den Hoecke (1622-1668); he then became a pupil of Rubens. Together with his father, Jan contributed to the decorations for the Joyous Entry of Ferdinand into Antwerp in 1635: the monumental figures of the King of Hungary and the Cardinal-Infante on the Arch of Ferdinand were by Jan. The draughtsman-like precision of the details is characteristic of his manner of working, while he hardly bothered to paint in the inner forms once they had been established. Other early works from this Antwerp period include the oil sketch of the Triumph of David (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth)."

His elder son, Gerard Hoet II, painted in his father's manner, before becoming an art dealer; he is chiefly remembered for the controversies in which he engaged concerning the art trade. Hendrick Jacob Hoet (1693-1733), the younger son of Gerard Hoet I, was a genre and still-life painter."

He trained as an engraver in the Rococo tradition, and by 1720 was established in London independently as an engraver on copper of billheads and book illustrations. In his spare time he studied painting, first at the St Martin's Lane Academy and later under Sir James Thornhill, whose daughter he married in 1729. By this time he had begun to make a name with small conversation pieces, and about 1730 he set up as a portrait painter. At about the same time he invented and popularized the use of a sequence of anecdotal pictures 'similar to representations on the stage' to point a moral and satirize social abuses. A Harlot's Progress (6 scenes, c. 1731; destroyed by fire) was followed by A Rake's Progress (8 scenes, Sir John Soane's Museum, London, c. 1735), and Marriage à la Mode (6 scenes, National Gallery, London, c. 1743), which each portray the punishment of vice in a somewhat lurid melodrama. Each series was painted with a view to being engraved, and the engravings had a wide sale and were popular with all classes. They were much pirated and Hogarth's campaigning against the profiteers led to the Copyright Act of 1735. 'I have endeavoured', he wrote, 'to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer: my picture is my stage, and men and women my players.'

2368,"HOLLAR, Wenceslaus","(b. 1607, Praha, d. 1677, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hollar/biograph.html,"
Bohemian etcher, illustrator and draughtsman, active in Germany, Flanders and England. He was an outstanding draughtsman and etcher of landscapes and topographical views and as an etcher also excelled in still-life subjects, best exemplified by his prints of shells and of muffs dating from the 1640s. Both fields show his instinct for direct and accurate recording. However, much of his illustrative work, enormously varied in subject-matter, is of no better than workmanlike quality and has always tended to undermine his reputation. Although Hollar spent some 32 of his 52 years of working life in England and signed himself with the anglicized form Wenceslaus, he always considered himself Bohemian, appending to his signature throughout his career the name of his native country or city.

2369,"HOLLÓSY, Simon","(b. 1857, Máramarossziget, d. 1918, Técsõ)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hollosy/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter, one of the greatest Hungarian representatives of 19th century naturalism and realism. Hollósy, who came from an Armenian family in Máramarossziget, learnt to paint in Budapest and Munich where he painted Corn Husking in 1885, which brought him success in Hungary and abroad."
2370,"HOLSTEYN, Cornelis","(b. 1618, Haarlem, d. 1658, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/holsteyn/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of Pieter Pietersz Holsteyn I (ca. 1585-1661) and his first wife Maritge Cornelisdr (1592/93-1647). His father, who was originally from Schleswig, was employed by the city of Haarlem as a stained-glass painter from 1634 to 1658 and was also active as a tapestry designer and engraver. Cornelis's elder brother was Pieter Pietersz Holsteyn II (Haarlem ca. 1614 - Amsterdam 1673), a painter, engraver and stained-glass painter. Their father remarried on 17 November 1647; his wife was Jacobijn Thymansdr of Kuyndert, Overijssel. The Holsteyn family was Catholic."
2371,"HOLT, Edwin Frederick","(b. 1830, Hampstead, d. 1912, Dunstable)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/holt/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was born in Hampstead in 1830 and lived most of his adult life in Dunstable. He studied at the Royal Academy of Art, where he won the silver medal in 1854. He exhibited seven pictures at the Royal Academy, twelve at the British Institution and forty at the Royal Society of British Artists."
2372,"HOLTZBECKER, Johannes Simon","(b. ca. 1615, Hamburg, d. 1671, Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/holtzbec/biograph.html,"
German flower painter. Although he enjoyed a great reputation during his lifetime, when his work was commissioned by the wealthy and the noble, Holtzbecker has gone unrecognised in the intervening centuries. This gross oversight is due to the rarity of his work - he executed approximately 3000 flower paintings, but they are contained in only 4 works (in 11 volumes) - but even more to the unfortunate misattribution of his masterpieces. Thus his slightly later compatriot, Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), herself a great botanical artist, has until recently been credited with almost all of Holtzbecker's known work."
2373,"HOMER, Winslow","(b. 1836, Boston, d. 1910, Prouts Neck)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/homer/biograph.html,"
American painter, illustrator and etcher. He was born in Boston, where he later worked as a lithographer and illustrator. In 1861 he was sent to the Civil War battlefront as correspondent for Harper's Weekly, his work winning international acclaim. Many of his studies of everyday life, such as Snap the Whip (1872, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), date from the postwar period, during which he was a popular magazine illustrator."

Dutch painter, member of a Dutch family of artists of Flemish origin. He was the son of Gillis de Hondecoutre, a landscape and animal painter in Utrecht and Amsterdam. Gijsbert followed his father, concentrating on sober views of barnyard fowl, and was a member of the Utrecht Guild of St Luke (1626-32), and his daughter Josina married the landscape painter Jan Baptist Weenix. Gijsbert's son Melchior d'Hondecoeter gained prominence for his more elegant avian themes. From the late 1620s the Dutch spelling of the family name was preferred.

Dutch painter, member of a Dutch family of artists of Flemish origin. (Until about 1620 the family name was spelt as de Hondecoutre.) He was the son of Nicolaes de Hondecoutre (d. 1609) from Mechelen who is mentioned in 1585-86 as a painter in Antwerp. Gillis was a landscape and animal painter in Utrecht and Amsterdam. His son, Gijsbert de Hondecoutre was also an animal painter. Another son, Nicolaes de Hondecoeter II (1605-?c. 1671), also became a painter.

2376,"HONDECOETER, Melchior d'","(b. 1636, Utrecht, d. 1695, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hondecoe/melchior/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He was the Netherlands most renowned painter of birds,winning an international reputation with his vigorous and brightly coloured canvases. They show both domestic and exotic birds, often in action and sometimes pointing a moral. Hondecoeter also painted still-lifes. He was a prolific artist and is represented in many museums. His father, Gijsbert was also a bird painter and his grandfather, Gillis  was a landscapist. Melchior trained with his father and with his uncle, Jan Baptist Weenix; he worked in Utrecht, The Hague, and Amsterdam.



"
2377,"HONDIUS, Abraham Danielsz.","(b. ca. 1625, Rotterdam, d. 1691, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hondius/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, etcher and draughtsman, active also in England. He was the son of Daniel Abramsz. de Hondt, the city stone mason of Rotterdam. He is said to have received his first training from Pieter de Bloot and Cornelis Saftleven. This is confirmed by parallels between early paintings by Hondius and Saftleven, who worked in Rotterdam from 1637. Also in favour of this assumption is the fact that works by Hondius are often confused with those of Ludolf de Jongh, another pupil of Saftleven. Hondius successfully combined various stylistic influences in his compositions, without, however, developing a style of his own. More than two thirds of his paintings, etchings and drawings are animal pieces: hunting scenes, animals fighting and animal studies. He also represented landscapes, genre, religious and mythological scenes such as Pyramus and Thisbe (c. 1600-65; Rotterdam, Boymans-van Beuningen).



"
2378,"HONDIUS, Hendrik I","(b. 1573, Duffel, d. ca. 1650, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hondius1/biograph.html,"
Engraver, etcher, draughtsman and publisher, part of a Dutch family of printmakers and publishers of Flemish descent, active in The Hague. Like another Hondius family of Amsterdam, with whom they are often confused, they fled from their native Flemish town because of the war with Spain. Guiljam Hondius, a school master in Duffel, moved his family to nearby Mechelen, but after he died his widow settled in Antwerp. Their son Hendrik Hondius I married Sara Jansdochter, daughter of an Antwerp goldsmith, and they moved to The Hague, where Hendrik became one of the most important Dutch reproductive printmakers and publishers in the early 17th century. The division commonly made in the literature between prints attributed to Hendrik I of the Hondius family from The Hague and Hendrik 'II' of the Hondius family from Amsterdam is arbitrary and in need of revision. The two families may well have been related, but a direct connection has not yet been established. Between 1598-99 and c. 1616 Hendrik I and his wife had five daughters and two sons, the portrait engraver Willem Hondius (?1600-1658) and Hendrik Hondius II, who became a print publisher."
2379,"HONE, Nathaniel the Elder","(b. 1718, Dublin, d. 1784, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hone/biograph.html,"
Irish portrait and miniature painter. He was raised in Dublin in a Dutch family whose family tree includes several renowned artists. His father, uncle to the portrait painters Horace Hone (1756-1825) and John Camillus Hone (1759-1836), as well as the great-great-great grand-uncle of Evie Hone (1894-1955) was a Dublin-based merchant. His son was great grand-uncle of Nathaniel Hone the Younger (1831-1917)."
2380,"HONTHORST, Gerrit van","(b. 1590, Utrecht, d. 1656, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/honthors/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (byname Gherardo della Notte), a leading member of the Utrecht school influenced by the Italian painter Caravaggio. He was born in Utrecht as the son of a textile painter. His younger brother Willem also became a painter. Van Honthorst was apprenticed to Abraham Bloemaert, the most celebrated master in Utrecht. He went to Italy around 1610-1615, when Caravaggio's influence there was at its height. In Italy, Van Honthorst acquired the nickname Gherardo delle Notti, because his figures are often portrayed in the darkness of night. He soon made a name for himself and received commissions from distinguished patrons such as Vincenzo Giustiniani and Cardinal Scipione Borghese.  Notable works of his Italian sojourn include The Beheading of St John the Baptist (S. Maria delle Scala, Rome), Christ Before the High Priest (c. 1617, National Gallery, London), and the Supper Party (1620, Uffizi, Florence), all nocturnal scenes. "

Dutch etcher, painter and caricaturist. He is best known for his political caricatures of Louis XIV of France and for his prints glorifying William III, Stadholder of the Netherlands and King of England. During his career, de Hooghe produced over 3500 prints. He also illustrated books, and his illustrations can be found in some of the most important texts of his period."
2384,"HOOGSTRATEN, Samuel van","(b. 1627, Dordrecht, d. 1678, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hoogstra/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and writer on art. He painted genre scenes in the style of de Hooch and Metsu, and portraits, but he is best known as a specialist in perspective effects. One of his ""perspective boxes"" which shows a painted toy world through a peep-hole, is in the National Gallery, London. Only in his early works can it be detected that he was a pupil of Rembrandt. Hoogstraten travelled to London, Vienna, and Rome, worked in Amsterdam and The Hague as well as his native Dordrecht, and was a man of many parts. He was an etcher, poet, director of the mint at Dordrecht, and art theorist. His Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (Introduction to the Art of Painting, 1678) contains one of the rare contemporary appraisals of Rembrandt's work.



"
2385,"HOPFER, Daniel","(b. ca. 1470, Kaufbeuren, d. 1536, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hopfer/biograph.html,"
Painter and printmaker, part of a German family of etchers. In 1497 Daniel Hopfer married Justina Grimm (d. ca. 1528), sister of the publisher and humanist Sigismund Grimm (active 1502-30). Daniel's sons Hieronymus Hopfer (active 1520. d. before 1550) and Lambert Hopfer (active 1520s) worked with him. Daniel produced more than 130 prints of various subjects for the popular market, Hieronymus 77 and Lambert 34. They placed their initials somewhere within the design on almost all of their prints (D.H., I.H., L.H.), adding a small device which might be a pinecone, from the coat of arms of the city of Augsburg, or a hop blossom, making a punning reference to the family name."
2386,"HOPPNER, John","(b. 1758, London, d. 1810, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hoppner/biograph.html,"
English painter of German descent, born in London. He was the son of a German lady-in-waiting to Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. From an early age he received protection and support from King George III, leading to speculation at the time that he may have been his son, although this has never been proved. Brought up at the British court, he trained as a chorister at the Chapel Royal. When he chose to reject this course of study in favour of enrolment in the Royal Academy schools, he received an allowance from the king."
2387,"HOREMANS, Jan Jozef I","(b. 1682, Antwerpen, d. 1759, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/horemans/jan_i/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was a pupil of the sculptor Michiel van der Voort I (1667-1737) and then of the Dutch painter Jan van Pee (before 1640-1710), who was active in Antwerp. Horemans joined the Guild of St Luke in 1706-07. He appears to have followed in the footsteps of the 17th-century Flemish genre painters, executing a few portraits and a large number of small anecdotal pictures that were highly prized on the market. In paintings such as the Village School and the Cobbler's Shop (both 1712; Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum), the Musical Company (1715; Brunswick, Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum) and the Card-players (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi) he represented scenes from contemporary everyday life that combine observation with a certain degree of stiffness. Most of his paintings are signed."
2388,"HOREMANS, Jan Jozef II","(b. 1714, Antwerpen, d. after 1790, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/horemans/jan_ii/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Jan Josef Horemans I. He qualified as a master of the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp on 10 February 1767 and was dean of the Guild on two occasions (1768-69 and 1775-76). He was a placid apologist for bourgeois virtues and, following his father's example, admirably recreated the atmosphere of his age in a multitude of small paintings that are pleasantly animated and have an old-fashioned charm. He also signed in the same way as his father, but his style was more distinguished and sensitive and his palette lighter (earning him the nickname ""le Clair"" that distinguishes him from his father ""le Sombre"")."

2390,"HORENBOUT, Lucas","(b. 1490/95, Ghent, d. 1544, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/horenbou/lucas/biograph.html,"
Miniature painter, son of Gerard Horenbout. By 1531 he was a court painter at the English court of Henry VIII, and in 1534 this office was conferred on him for life. No surviving work can be attributed to him with certainty. This is partly because, during his long career as court painter, he was paid a large fixed annuity rather than a negotiable fee for individual commissions. It was Lucas Horenbout who introduced Hans Holbein the Younger to the art of painting portrait miniatures. Lucas has been plausibly credited with the earliest of all English portrait miniatures, probably pendants representing henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. On stylistic grounds, certain other miniatures, as well as book illuminations may be added to him.



"
2391,"HORNY, Franz","(b. 1798, Weimar, d. 1824, Olevano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/horny/biograph.html,"
German painter. He received his first instruction in art from his father, Conrad Horny (1764-1807), a painter and copperplate engraver, who taught at the Zeichenschule in Weimar. He attended this school from 1806 to 1816, training primarily as a painter of landscapes. In 1816, his patron Baron Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, a friend of his father, enabled him to travel to Italy."

2394,"HOUASSE, Michel-Ange","(b. ca. 1680, Paris, d. 1730, Arpajon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/houasse/son/biograph.html,"
French painter, the son of René-Antoine Houasse. On his deathbed in 1700, Charles II, the last Spanish Habsburg ruler, named Bourbon Philip of Anjou - the grandson of France's Louis XIV - as his successor, thus triggering the War of the Spanish Succession. It was not until 1713 that Philip secured his crown (as Philip V), at the cost of renouncing any future claim to the French throne. From 1715 a number of French painters, travelling in Philip's train, became influential in Spain, including Michel-Ange Houasse, whose genre paintings influenced Goya, Jean Ranc, and Louis-Michel Van Loo. Houasse became painter at the court of Philip V between 1715 and 1730. Houasse introduced to Spain the pastoral subjects derived from the paintings of Watteau.


"
2395,"HOUBRAKEN, Arnold","(b. 1660, Dordrecht, d. 1719, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/houbrake/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, etcher and writer, part of a family of artists. Although a competent artist, Arnold Houbraken is best known as a writer. His three-volume Groote schouburgh (The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters, 1718-21), the last volume of which was published posthumously, is generally regarded as one of the most important sources on the lives of 17th-century Dutch artists - despite its many omissions and errors. As an artist, he was taught by Jacobus Levecq and Samuel van Hoogstraten in Dordrecht and went on to have a relatively successful studio in Dordrecht and Amsterdam. He specialized in small scale, precise history paintings, portraits and gentile genre scenes."
2396,"HOUCKGEEST, Gerard","(b. ca. 1600, The Hague, d. 1661, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/houckgee/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter who worked in Delft and specialized in church interiors. He was probably a van Bassen pupil and began as a painter of imaginary church interiors and renaissance buildings. Most likely he was in England during the 1630s; Charles I owned at least five 'prospectives' by or partly by him. His fictive Palace Interior of 1635, his earliest existing dated painting, is still at Hampton Court. Houckgeest is documented in Delft in the 1640s. His first known depiction of an actual church interior is his unexpected New Church in Delft with the Tomb of Willem the Silent, dated 1650, now at Hamburg. During the following 4-5 years he painted about half-dozen pictures of both the New and Old Church of Delft using the innovative diagonal perspective of the Hamburg painting."

2400,"HUBER, Jean","(b. 1721, Geneve, d. 1786, Bellevue)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hubejean/biograph.html,"
Painter, silhouettist, draughtsman and printmaker, member of a Swiss family of artists. His paternal ancestors were patrician Genevese merchant bankers. As a young man he soldiered at Kassel in Germany and in Italy, where he fought for Savoy in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). In 1752 he was elected to Geneva's Council of Two Hundred and served his native city as a magistrate. He had no formal artistic training, but from his youth he clipped out of paper or cards freehand profiles of a kind that later came to be called silhouettes. He also devised what he called tableaux en découpures, cut in vellum or parchment on the scale of large reproductive prints; these represented antique subjects, landscapes and genre scenes.  He is best known for his witty paintings, cut-out profiles, prints and drawings of the writer and thinker Voltaire.


"
2401,"HUBER, Wolf","(b. ca. 1490, Feldkirch, d. 1553, Passau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huber/biograph.html,"
Huber was a German/Austrian painter, draughtsman and woodcut artist, who, after Altdorfer, was the most important member of the Danube school. He worked in Regensburg and Passau. Few paintings by him are known and it is in woodcuts and drawings that his lyrical approach to landscape can best be seen.

German painter and poet (Rudolf Julius Benno Hübner). He studied at the Academy in Berlin with Wilhelm von Schadow. He first attracted attention by his picture of Ruth and Boaz (1825). He traveled in Italy and resided for the most part at Düsseldorf until 1839. In that year he settled at Dresden, becoming a professor in the Academy of Arts in 1841 and director of the Gallery of Paintings in 1871. He obtained the great gold medal at Brussels in 1851."

After studies in Heidelberg (1813–15) and at Weinbrenner's school of architecture in Karlsruhe (1815–17) he traveled extensively in Greece and Italy (1817–24). He succeeded Weinbrenner as Baurat (Building Inspector) at Karlsruhe, Baden, in 1827. In 1831 he was appointed Oberbaurat. He designed many churches and other public buildings, mainly in the Grand Duchy of Baden. His best work of architecture is arguably the elegant Trinkhalle (Spa Pump Room), Baden-Baden (1837–40), with its segmental arcades."
2404,"HUCHTENBURG, Jan van","(b. 1647, Haarlem, d. 1733, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huchtenb/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was taught by the battle painter Jan Wyck, only three years his senior. Around 1667 Huchtenburg set out for Rome, to join his elder brother Jacob, who had studied with Nicolaes Berchem. Jan seems not to have reached the Eternal City, but ended up in Paris, where he worked for several years at the Manufacture des Gobelins under Adam Frans van der Meulen, Louis XIV's celebrated battle painter. Around 1669 Huchtenburg returned to Haarlem, where he joined the guild of St Luke. In 1676 the artist relocated his studio to Amsterdam, where he became highly successful as a painter of battle pieces. Huchtenburg is best known for the series of ten large-scale battle scenes he painted for Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1708-09, today in the Galleria Saubada in Turin."

In 1891-93 he studied at the Academy in Munich with Otto Seitz (1846-1912). From 1897 he painted Impressionist landscapes in Bohemia, especially mountain scenery. He became friends with Antonín Slavíček."
2406,"HUDSON, Thomas","(b. 1701, Devonshire, 1779, Twickenham)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hudson/biograph.html,"
English painter and collector. He was one of the foremost portrait painters in England in the mid-18th century. His work combines the high-keyed colours of the Rococo with poses derived from such artists as van Dyck, Kneller and his own teacher and father-in-law, Jonathan Richardson. He painted at least 400 portraits, about 80 of which were engraved. Among his many pupils were Joseph Wright of Derby, John Hamilton Mortimer and Joshua Reynolds. Hudson was a member of the group of artists including Hogarth, Allan Ramsay, Francis Hayman and the sculptor John Michael Rysbrack who met at Old Slaughter's Coffee House in the mid-1740s and who promoted Thomas Coram's Foundling Hospital, of which they were governors, as the first public exhibiting space for artists in London."
2407,"HUET, Christophe","(b. 1700, Pontoise, d. 1759, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huet/christop/biograph.html,"
French painter, part of a family of artists. Christophe Huet was a painter appreciated by his 18th-century contemporaries for his animal pictures, but he is now best known for his decorative schemes in the manner of Watteau. His brother Nicolas Huet (1718-after 1788), a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Oudry, specialized in paintings of flowers and fruit. Nicolas's son Jean-Baptiste (Marie) Huet I was an animal painter of some distinction, whose three sons Nicolas Huet II (active 1788-1827), François Huet (1772-1813) and Jean-Baptiste Huet II (b. 1772) were painters and engravers."

He trained with his father, Nicolas Huet (1718-after 1788), and was then apprenticed to the animal painter Charles Dagomer (active 1762-1764), a member of the Académie de Saint-Luc. Huet's interest in printmaking and his acquaintance with Gilles Demarteau (1722-1776), who later engraved many of his compositions, both date from this period."
2409,"HUGGINS, William John","(b. 1781, London, d. 1845, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huggins/biograph.html,"
English painter of whose parents nothing is known. After several years at sea in the service of the East India Company, he settled in London. His house at 36 Leadenhall Street was near East India House, and he was regularly employed to paint carefully detailed pictures of the company's ships. He exhibited 16 marine paintings at the Royal Academy between 1817 and 1844 and also showed at the British Institution and Suffolk Street."

Though regarded in France as one of that country's greatest poets, he is better known abroad for such novels as Notre-Dame de Paris (1831) and Les Misérables (1862). After training as a lawyer, Hugo embarked on the literary career and assembled a massive body of work while living in Paris, Brussels and the Channel Islands."

Catalan painter, the most prominent figure in the Catalan School during the second part of the 15th century. Huguet is thought to have settled in Barcelona about 1448. He continued the Catalan tradition of Bernat Martorell, but was highly individual in his characterization. His studio produced many sumptuous composite altarpieces of the type that became typical in Spanish art and his work exercised a wide influence on the painting of Catalonia and Aragón.



"
2412,HUGUET,(d. 1438),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huguet1/biograph.html,"
Architect, active in Portugal. His origin is unknown, but the most widely accepted hypothesis is that he was from the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Huguet was the second architect to be appointed to the construction of the monastery of Batalha, and from 1402 until his death he supervised the completion of the church, the cloisters and the chapter house, which had been begun by Afonso Domingues (d 1401)."
2413,"HUILLIOT, Pierre Nicolas","(b. 1674, Paris, d. 1751, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huilliot/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was part of a renowned Parisian painters' family, son of the still-life painter Claude Huilliot (c. 1632-1702), who worked with Jean Baptiste Monnoyer on the decoration of the châteaux at Versailles, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and Fontainebleau. His maternal grandfather had worked for Louis XIV and Anne of Austria as 'Maitre peintre ordinaire des Bâtiments du Roi' in which capacity he had close contact with Simon Vouet and Eustache Le Sueur."
2414,"HULSDONCK, Jacob van","(b. 1582, Antwerpen, d. 1647, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hulsdonc/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Although born in Antwerp, Jacob van Hulsdonck was raised in Middleburg, the southwestern Dutch town where Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder and his circle worked. He first studied painting in Middelburg and for forty years in Antwerp Hulsdonck remained loyal to Bosschaert's subjects and meticulous style, though in this comparatively late composition Snyders's sense of rhythm and convincing sense of space appear to have influenced him."
2415,"HUMBERT DE SUPERVILLE, David Pierre Giottino","(b. 1770, Den Haag, d. 1849, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/humbert/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and printmaker. He was a draughtsman, lithographer, etcher, and portrait painter, and also wrote treatises on art, including the influential work Essai sur les signes inconditionnels dans l'art (Leiden, 1827)."
2416,"HUMMEL, Johann Erdmann","(b. 1769, Kassel, d. 1852, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hummel/biograph.html,"
German painter. His pioneering realist genre scenes from 1812-1820 were among the first to develop in style and theme essential characteristics of the first period of Biedermeier art. Because of the transitional nature of these paintings and their significance as models for subsequent Biedermeier realism, their influences are crucial and shed light on the origins of that style. The sources are 17th century Dutch art, Zopfstil painting, the indigenous Berlin tradition of realism, and 15th century Northern Renaissance art which was just being discovered at this time."
2417,"HUNT, William Holman","(b. 1827, London, d. 1910, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hunt/biograph.html,"
English painter, co-founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. A clerk for several years, he left the world of trade to study at the British Museum and the National Gallery."
2418,"HUNT, William Morris","(b. 1824, Brattleboro, Vermont, d. 1879, Appledore, New Hampshire)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hunt_wm/biograph.html,"
American painter whose work was influenced by French artists of the time, and his genre paintings are romantic and somewhat sentimental, as seen in The Bathers 1877. He was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, the brother of Richard Morris Hunt, a celebrated architect. He studied in Germany 1845-46 and Paris 1846-55 before settling in Boston in 1862."
2419,"HUPIN, Jacques",(active in mid-17th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hupin/biograph.html,"
French painter active in Austere. We know practically nothing about this artist, the only mention in archives is that he was in Rome in 1649."
2420,"HUQUIER, Gabriel","(b. 1698, Torino, d. 1750, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huquier/biograph.html,"
French draughtsman, engraver and merchant of prints. He executed a large number of engravings after Boucher, Watteau, Gillot, and other French masters, and he is distinguished by his deep knowledge in arts. He had a valuable collection of drawings and prints, and on certain days of the week it was open for all artists and other visitors."
2421,"HURTADO IZQUIERDO, Francisco","(b. 1669, Priego de Córdoba, d. 1725, Córdoba)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hurtado/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect, sculptor and decorator, noted as the architect of the Sagrario (Sancta Sanctorum) in the Carthusian monastery in Granada. He was an inventive master builder. His decorative forms, deriving from classical elements, but with prismatic angles and multiple ornamental details, influenced Andalusian Baroque architecture for decades."
2422,"HUTAULT, Maximilien Joseph",(active 1810-1812 in Fontainebleau),https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/hutault/biograph.html,"
French garden architect. He is known as the creator of the English Garden (Jardin Anglais) at the Palace of Fontainebleau. No other biographical data are available.

2423,"HUYS, Frans","(b. ca. 1522, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1562, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huys/frans/biograph.html,"
Flemish engraver and draftsman. He was the brother of Pieter Huys and the brother-in-law of Hans Liefrinck I (c. 1518-1573)."
2424,"HUYS, Pieter","(b. ca. 1520, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1584, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huys/pieter/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and engraver, part of a family of artists. The brothers Pieter Huys and Frans Huys (c. 1522-c. 1562) both worked as engravers for the print publisher Hieronymus Cock and the firm of Christoph Plantin. Together they were responsible for the engravings in the Vivae imagines partium corporis humani (Antwerp, 1566) published by Plantin. Pieter's own style, however, was best expressed in his paintings."
2425,"HUYSMANS, Jacob","(b. ca. 1630, Antwerpen, d. 1696, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huysman/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England as Jacob Houseman. He was a pupil of Gilles Backereel (c. 1572-before 1662) and Frans Wouters, presumably in Antwerp, but he came to London before the Restoration. Works painted soon after his arrival in England include small pastiches of mythological and religious subjects by Anthony van Dyck, and much of his mature work is in a flamboyantly Baroque manner that derives ultimately from van Dyck's second Flemish period and suggests, on a larger scale, the influence of Wouters. As a Roman Catholic he was acceptable to Charles II's consort, Catherine of Braganza, and to other Catholics at the English court."
2426,"HUYSMANS, Cornelis","(b. 1648, Antwerpen, d. 1727, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huysmans/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was the son of a builder, Hendrik Huysmans, and Catharina van der Meyden, and the brother of Jan Baptist Huysmans. After his parents' deaths he was brought up by his uncle, who apprenticed him to the landscape painter Gaspard de Witte (1624-81) or, according to other sources, to Huysman's half-brother Pieter, though there is nothing to support this in the records of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He moved to Brussels to train with Jacques d'Arthois, who, on Huysmans's own testimony, was the most important influence on his development as a painter. On 24 January 1682 he married Maria Anna Schepers in Mechelen and in 1688 signed an agreement with the Mechelen painters' guild, which allowed him, upon payment of 24 guilders and 14 stuivers, to practise his trade there. Perhaps some difficulties he experienced with the guild encouraged his move to Antwerp, where he became a master in 1706-07. In 1716 he returned to Mechelen, where he took on Augustus-Casimir Redel and Jean Edmond Turner as pupils. Most of his life was spent in Mechelen."
2427,"HUYSMANS, Jan Baptist","(b. 1654, Antwerpen, d. 1716, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huysmans/janbapt/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of painters. He was the brother and pupil of Cornelis Huysmans. He was less skillful in his imitation of the Venetians than his brother. Examples of his few surviving works are in the museums of Brussels and Antwerp.



"
2428,"HUYSSENS, Pieter","(b. 1577, Brugge, d. 1637, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huyssens/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect. His father and grandfather were master masons, and Pieter was already a master mason when he entered the Society of Jesus in 1596 in Tournai. His first architectural commission for the society was the construction of the college church of Maastricht in 1606 (today a theatre)."
2429,"HUYSUM, Jan van","(b. 1682, Amsterdam, d. 1749, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huysum/jan/biograph.html,"Dutch painter, with Rachel Ruysch the most distinguished flower painter of his day. He had a European reputation and was much imitated. The light colours he used, the even lighter bakcgrounds, and the openness of his intricate compositions became distinguishing features of 18th century Dutch flower painting. He occasionally painted subjects other than flowers, including a selfportrait in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. His father, Justus the Elder, was a flower and landscape painter and he had three painter brothers: Justus the Younger (c. 1684-1707): Michiel (d. 1759); and Jacob (c. 1687-1740 ?), who worked in England and imitated Jan's style.






"
2430,"HUYSUM, Justus van, I","(b. 1659, Amsterdam, d. 1716, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/h/huysum/justus1/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists. He studied with Nicolaes Berchem and painted many different subjects, such as portraits, marine scenes, landscapes, history and battle paintings, but was best known for his flower paintings. At his death, Justus I left a collection of 663 paintings, enough to suggest that he may also have been a dealer. Of his ten children, four were painters: Jan van Huysum, Justus van Huysum II (1685-1707), Jacobus van Huysum (1687/89-1740) and Michiel van Huysum (1704-1760).



"
2431,"IBBETSON, Julius Caesar",(1759-1817),https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ibbetson/biograph.html,"
English painter. His unusual Christian names were given to him because of his Caesarian birth. He specialized in fairly small landscapes with figures and animals. Benjamin West called him 'the Berchem of England'. Ibbetson worked mainly in his native Yorkshire, but also for a time in London and the Lake District, and he visited Java (1789). He worked in watercolour as well as oil and also made etchings. In 1803 he published a treatise on painting. Like his friend Morland, Ibbetson is said to have been given to dissipation, but his work did not obviously suffer because of this as Morland's did.



"
2432,"IBI, Sinibaldo","(b. ca. 1475, Perugia, d. ca. 1550, Perugia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ibi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He initially showed great promise, closely following the style of his masters Perugino, Raphael and Bernardino Pinturicchio, but the individuality and quality of his work progressively diminished. In 1496, with Berto di Giovanni (c. 1475-c. 1529), Eusebio da San Giorgio (c. 1465-after 1540), Lattanzio di Giovanni (d. 1534) and Lodovico di Angelo (1481-1522), he took a year's lease on a workshop near the Porta Eburnea in Perugia."
2433,"INDUNO, Gerolamo","(b. 1825, Milano, d. 1890, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/induno/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Domenico Induno (1815-1878). a painter of genre and historical paintings. Like his brother, Gerolamo enrolled at the Accademia di Belli Arti di Brera to study under Luigi Sabatelli but left to participate in the uprising against Austrian rule in 1848. He joined in the 1849 defence of Rome, enlisted for the Crimea in 1855 and followed Garibaldi on his 1859 campaign. Much of his work derived from these military experiences (e.g. Garibaldi at Capua, 1861; Museo del Risorgimento, Milan), and, upon his return to Milan, he received many official commissions for paintings of Italian patriotic themes, for example Departure of the Conscripts (1881; Civico Museo d'Arte Contemporanea, Milan), and for portraits of important figures of the Risorgimento, such as Victor Emmanuel II (1867; Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan). Gerolamo's anecdotal genre pieces were also popular. These included scenes of contemporary everyday life and costume pieces in 18th-century settings, for example Kissing Hands at the Carriage (1881; Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Milan)."
2434,"INGLÉS, Jorge",(active c. 1454-1485 in Castile),https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ingles/biograph.html,"
Painter and illuminator, active in Spain. His name suggests that he was of English origin, and he may have been trained in the Netherlands. His work shows the influence of Rogier van der Weyden and of Netherlandish tapestries and manuscript illumination. He employed a vigorous drawing technique, and his figures are sculptural and expressive, particularly the faces and hands. The sumptuous clothes show that he understood the characteristics of Spanish brocades. The settings are enlarged by an ambitious use of perspective and are filled with carpets, flagstones and canopies; details such as books give a sense of atmosphere, and openings are used to reveal landscape. He was the first painter in Castile known by name to employ the Netherlandish technique of oil on panel. He is regarded as the author of the altarpiece of San Jerónimo de la Mejorada (Provincial Museum, Valladolid), and of a picture in which a saint is shown preaching, now in the Cincinnati Art Museum.



"
2435,"INGRES, Jean-Auguste-Dominique","(b. 1780, Montauban, d. 1867, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ingres/biograph.html,"
French painter, the son of a minor painter and sculptor, Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres (1755-1814). After an early academic training in the Toulouse Academy he went to Paris in 1796 and was a fellow student of Gros in David's studio. He won the Prix de Rome in 1801, but owing to the state of France's economy he was not awarded the usual stay in Rome until 1807. In the interval he produced his first portraits. These fall into two categories: portraits of himself and his friends, conceived in a Romantic spirit (Self-portrait, Musée Condé, Chantilly, 1804), and portraits of well-to-do clients characterized by purity of line and enamel-like colouring {Mlle Rivière, Louvre, Paris, 1805). These early portraits are notable for their calligraphic line and expressive contour, which had a sensuous beauty of its own beyond its function to contain and delineate form. It was a feature that formed the essential basis of Ingres's painting throughout his life."
2436,"INNESS, George","(b. 1825, Newburgh, d. 1894, Bridge of Allan)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/innes/biograph.html,"
American landscape painter originally influenced by the Hudson River School. He grew up in Newark, and New York City, and received his first artistic training with John Jesse Barker (active 1815-56), an itinerant artist claiming to be a student of Thomas Sully. Inness's early attraction to the Old Masters, especially to Claude Lorrain, is evident in his landscapes of the 1840s. He went to Rome and Florence in 1847, and in 1854-55 he was in Paris, where he was influenced by the Barbizon School. He spent many years in Europe, with four years in France and Italy (1870-74)."
2437,"INWOOD, William","(b. 1766, London, d. 1843, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/inwood/biograph.html,"
English architect. He was brought up as an architect and surveyor. From 1813 he exhibited architectural designs at the Royal Academy. He was the architect of the new buildings, completed in 1814, for the Westminster National Free School."
2438,"IRIARTE, Ignacio de","(b. 1621, Azcoitia, Guipúzcoa, d. 1670, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/iriarte/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and printmaker. He was the leading Baroque landscape painter of his generation in Seville. In 1646 he was married in Aracena, Huelva. He soon moved to Seville, where he married again in 1649. Nothing is known of his apprenticeship, and it is doubtful that Francisco de Herrera the Elder was his teacher. Iriarte's style was strongly influenced by Flemish landscape, which was then extremely popular in Seville, in particular by the landscapes of Josse de Momper II. The signed and dated Landscape with Shepherds (1665; Madrid, Prado) serves as a touchstone for all attributions."
2439,"ISABEY, Eugène","(b. 1803, Paris, d. 1886, Montévrain)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/isabey/eugene/biograph.html,"
Painter and printmaker, son of Jean-Baptiste Isabey. He spent his earliest years in the Louvre among such artists as François Gérard and the Vernet family. His first works, mostly landscapes in watercolour, painted on the outskirts of Paris, display an independent character that owes little to the influence of his father or the other artists among whom he had lived. In 1820 he travelled to Normandy with his father, Charles Nodier and Alphonse de Cailleux, the future director of the Louvre."
2440,"ISABEY, Jean-Baptist","(b. 1767, Nancy, d. 1855, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/isabey/jeanbapt/biograph.html,"
Painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He trained in Nancy with Jean Girardet (d 1778) and then with Jean-Baptiste-Charles Claudot (1733-1805), master of the miniaturist Jean-Baptiste Augustin. In 1785 he went to Paris, where he began by painting snuff-boxes. In 1786 he received lessons from the painter François Dumont, who had also studied with Girardet in Nancy, before entering the studio of David. Although he had received aristocratic commissions before the Revolution to paint portrait miniatures of the Duc d'Angouleme and Duc de Berry and through them of Marie-Antoinette, he did not suffer in the political upheavals that followed. He executed 228 portraits of deputies for a work on the Assemblée Législative and from 1793 exhibited miniatures and drawings in the Salon."
2441,ISAIA DA PISA,(active 1447–64),https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/isaia/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His grandfather, Giovanni di Gante, was a stone-carver, and his father, Pippo di Giovanni de Ghante da Pisa, who worked with Donatello on the Brancacci monument in the Baptistery in Florence in 1426, was documented at the Vatican in 1431. This suggests that Isaia was taken to Rome as a youth. He was probably active as a sculptor before 1447, since Filarete, who was forced to flee Rome at that date, mentioned Isaia in his Trattato."
2442,"ISENBRANT, Adriaen","(b. ca. 1490, Bruges, d. 1551, Bruges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/isenbran/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. He became a master in Bruges in 1510 and is said by an early source to have been a pupil of Gerard David. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of him and there are no signed or documented works. However, in 1902 the Belgian art historian Georges Hulin de Loo proposed Isenbrandt as the author of a large group of paintings deriving from David, and the identification has generally been accepted. Previously the paintings had been attributed to Jan Mostaert and the anonymous Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin, named after a diptych of the subject divided between the church of Notre-Dame in Bruges and the Musées Royaux in Brussels. Because of the uncertainty, some authorities prefer to use the name Isenbrandt in inverted commas.



"
2443,"ISRAELS, Isaac Lazarus","(b. 1865, Amsterdam, d. 1934, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/israels/isaac/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of Jozef Israëls, the leader of the Hague School painters. Isaac was largely self-taught, showing precocious talent and attending the Academie in The Hague in 1878-80. His first paintings date from 1880-84 and include a self-portrait, portraits of women and military subjects such as Bugle Practice (1881; The Hague, Rijksmuseum Mesdag). They were composed in the studio in a precise style, soft grey and brown tones predominating, showing the influence of the Hague school."
2444,"ISRAËLS, Jozef","(b. 1824, Groningen, d. 1911, Scheveningen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/israels/jozef/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher, often called the ""Dutch Millet"". He was, during his lifetime, the most internationally celebrated Dutch painter of the 19th century and a leader of the Hague School. He was particularly noted for his scenes of life among the Dutch fishing and peasant communities."
2445,"ITTENBACH, Franz","(b. 1813, Königswinter, d. 1879, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ittenbac/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was the youngest child of ten, born to staunchly Catholic parent who ran a small wine shop. Having successfully exhibited in 1831 at an exhibition of Dusseldorf artists in Cologne, Ittenbach was admitted to the Dusseldorf Academy in 1832. His teachers were Theodore Hildebrandt, and Carl Ferdinand Sohn, but above all, Wilhelm Schadow, with whom he studied privately and with whom he travelled to Rome in 1839. Upon his return to Germany in 1842, Ittenbach embarked on a Wandereise throughout the country in the company of his friends and fellow-students."
2446,"IVÁNYI GRÜNWALD, Béla","(b. 1867, Somogysom, d. 1940, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ivanyi/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He was a pupil of Bertalan Székely and Károly Lotz in the School of  Decorative Art in Budapest in 1882-84. He studied art at Gabriel von Hackl (1843-1926) in the Munich Academy, then at the Julian Academy in Paris. He was particularly influenced by Bastien Lapage and Dagnan-Bouveret. Later he returned to Munich and joined Hollósy's group of artists. His pictures painted in the 1890s reflected naturalistic tendencies of Bastien-Lapage (The Warlord's Sword, Devotion, 1891)."
2447,"IVERNY, Jacques",(active about 1411-1435),https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/iverny/biograph.html,"
French painter. In 1411-12 he painted banners with the arms of Avignon, and in 1413 he was paid by Pierre d'Acigné, seneschal of Provence, for an altarpiece of 'Our Lord' for St Sauveur, Aix-en-Provence. For Cavaillon Cathedral, in 1422, he was commissioned to execute four stained-glass windows. In 1427 Iverny executed pennants for the municipal ship that sailed the Rhône, and also processional banners. A panel with a gold ground and the signature Jacobus Iverini depicting François de Nyons, Abbot of Ste Geneviève, Paris, kneeling before St Agricol and flanked by his arms, was recorded in St Agricol, Avignon, in the 18th century. None of these works is known to survive.

2448,"IVES, Chauncey Bradley","(b. 1810, Hamden, Connecticut, d. 1894, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ives/biograph.html,"
American sculptor, who played a significant role in making sculpture in America generally popular. Beginning as a woodcarver, he worked in Boston (1837-c.1841) and New York City (c.1841-1844), studied in Florence, Italy (1844-1851), then settled in Rome."
2449,"IXNARD, Pierre-Michel d'","(b. 1723, Nimes, d. 1795, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/i/ixnard/biograph.html,"
French architect, regarded as the pioneer of early Classicism in southern Germany. He initially worked as a carpenter, but also as a bricklayer, stonemason, locksmith and mirror-maker, and was trained by the Paris architect Jacques-François Blondel (1681-1756). He followed his teacher Jean Nicolas Servandoni (1695-1766) to Stuttgart in 1763."
2450,"JACKSON, Gilbert",(active 1621-1640),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jackson/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was an itinerant portrait painter whose origins are unknown; he is documented as painting from about 1620 to about 1640 from recorded commissions and signed and dated paintings. He was made free of the Painter-Stainers Company in London in December 1640, but he had probably been active before that date in the provinces as well as in London. He was patronized by country families and by members of the learned professions. He does not appear to have worked for the court."
2451,"JACOB, Georges","(b. 1739, Cheny, d. 1814, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacob/biograph.html,"
French furniture maker. Despite his humble origins, Georges Jacob rose to become one of the most renowned menuisiers of his day. Unlike many artisans who joined their fathers or brothers in the middle-class family trade of furniture making, Jacob was from a peasant family and moved to Paris at sixteen to begin his career. He apprenticed in a joinery workshop and eventually became a master in 1765. He developed a reputation for producing inventive designs for chairs, beds, and screens carved with such motifs as twisted ribbons, guilloches, beading, and fluting."
2452,"JACOB, Louis","(b. 1712, Lisieux, d. 1802, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacob_l/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He moved to Paris whilst still very young, and was a pupil of Gérard Scotin the Younger, then of Jean Audran. He engraved several plates in the Crozat Collection, after Paolo Veronese. Hutin also commissioned him to reproduce The Wedding Feast at Cana, by the same master, for The Dresden Gallery collection. He engraved several works after French masters such as Boucher and Watteau."
2453,JACOBELLO DEL BONOMO,(doc. 1375-1385),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacobel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a close follower of Lorenzo Veneziano, perpetuating his style through the second half of the fourteenth century. He was Venetian but his known works were for locations outside Venice.  He was identified as the Master of Arquà, an anonymous painter around whom a number of works were grouped, taking a polyptych in the Oratorio of SS. Trinità in Arquà Petrarca as the core work."
2454,JACOBELLO DEL FIORE,"(b. 1370, Venezia, d. 1439, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacobell/biograph.html,"
Venetian painter, who broke away from the Byzantine tradition exemplified by Paolo Veneziano which dominated Venetian art until the end of the 14th century. He was in turn influenced by the Intenational Gothic style of the early 15th century. Most of his works are in Venice.

Dirck Jacobsz, the son of Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen was one of the first artists to specialize in portraiture. In 1529 he also painted the first portrait of a civic guard association, which was to became a Dutch speciality. He was later eclipsed by Anthonis Mor of Utrecht, court painter to the Spanish Netherlands.

Juriaen Jacobsz. (Jacobsen or Jacobson), Dutch painter. Between c. 1645 and 1652 he worked as a portraitist in Hamburg. Between 1652 and 1658 in Antwerp he was a pupil in the workshop of Frans Snyders, and he worked as an assistant. Between 1659 and 1654 he worked in Amsterdam. From 1665 until his death he was in Leeuwarden and served as a court painter to Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz.



"
2458,"JACOBSZ., Lambert","(b. ca. 1598, Amsterdam, d. 1636, Leeuwarden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacobszl/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the son of a well-to-do Mennonite cloth merchant in Amsterdam. He served his apprenticeship there among the artists now called the Pre-Rembrandtists. After his marriage in 1620, commemorated by the poet Joost van den Vondel (1587-1639), he settled in Leeuwarden, his wife's native city, where he became a preacher in the Mennonite community and worked primarily as a painter. He was also active as an art dealer, as is known from his estate inventory, which records transactions in Amsterdam with the Mennonite art dealer and patron of Rembrandt, Hendrick van Uylenburgh. Two of Jacobsz.'s pupils were Govaert Flinck and Jacob Backer. His son, the painter Abraham van den Tempel probably also studied with him before becoming Backer's pupil c. 1642-46.



"
2459,"JACOMART, Jaume Baço","(b. 1411, Valencia, d. 1461, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacomart/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He enjoyed the patronage of King Alfonso V of Aragon (reg 1416-58) and of his son John II (reg 1458-79). In 1440 he was summoned to Italy by Alfonso, who was laying siege to Naples; he abandoned the work he had in progress and left Valencia late in 1442. He became court painter in 1444 and returned to Valencia in 1446 but left again in 1447 to accompany Alfonso to Tivoli on a military campaign against the Florentines. He is mentioned in Valencia again from 1451 until his death.



"
2460,JACOMETTO VENEZIANO,"(active 1472, d. 1497)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacomett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. Knowledge of the artistic activity of Jacometto is based almost exclusively on the notebooks of Marcantonio Michiel, who recorded a number of his works in the patrician houses of Venice and Padua in the first half of the 16th century. In Pietro Bembo's house Michiel saw a small picture with scenes from the life of a saint, and portraits of Bembo as a child of eleven and of his brother Carlo as a newborn baby in 1472; in the house of Francesco Zio Michiel saw four miniatures by Jacometto in a Book of Hours; in the house of Zuanantonio Venier he saw a small picture with animals painted in chiaroscuro; in the house of Antonio Pasqualino he saw a number of drawings; in the house of Gabriele Vendramin he saw a portrait painted (or drawn) in chiaroscuro, and a small book of vellum with pen drawings of animals and candelabra; and finally, in the house of Michele Contarini in 1543 the author saw 'a little portrait of Messer Alvise Contarini ..., who died some years ago; and on the same panel there is a portrait of a nun of San Secondo. On the cover of these portraits there is a small (?)deer in a landscape; and their leather case is decorated with foliage stamped with gold. This most perfect work is by the hand of Jacometto.'"
2461,JACOPINO DA REGGIO,(active 1265-c. 1300 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopin/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. He is recorded in many documents relating to the copying of books, and he signed the decoration of a copy of Gratian's Decretals (Rome, Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, MS. Vat. lat. 1375) to which several illuminators contributed. If this signature is accepted as belonging not to a stationer who had the manuscript illustrated, but to the principal illuminator who organized the work and was himself responsible for the most important decoration, then Jacopino can be identified as the most important Bolognese master working in the Byzantine style at the end of the 13th century, and the illuminator of the Bible of Clement VII (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS. lat. 18)."
2462,JACOPINO DA TRADATE,(active 1401-1440 in Milan and Mantua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was the leading sculptor active in the construction site of the Cathedral of Milan in the first quarter of the fifteenth century, where remained many statues and reliefs by him. Later he moved to the Gonzaga court in Mantua. Among the best known works of Jacopino are a big relief with the figure of Pope Martin V on the throne in the ambulatory of the Milan Cathedral and a statue of the Madonna and Child preserved at the Castello Sforzesco in Milan. In the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, Milan, a funerary monument is attributed to Jacopino and in Ancona, a Crucifixion placed above the main altar."
2463,JACOPO del CASENTINO,"(b. ca. 1297, Firenze, d. ca. 1349, Pratovecchio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/casentin/biograph.html,"
Jacopo del Casentino (Jacopo Landini), Italian painter, one of the most important painters of the early 1300s in Florence. Probably trained with some contact with the workshop of Giotto, and especially of Taddeo Gaddi, Jacopo also looked at the Lorenzetti, from whom the more Gothic elements of his style derive. He was active first at Arezzo, later he run a large workshop in Florence. His large altarpiece depicting the legend of St Miniatus was commissioned by the Calimala Guild for the church of San Miniato in Florence. His mature style was determined by the influence of Sienese painting.



"
2464,JACOPO DI CIONE,"(b. ca. 1325, Firenze, d. ca. 1399, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/cione/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists. He was the brother of Andrea di Cione (called Orcagna), Nardo di Cione and Matteo di Cione (1330-1380). In 1366-67 he was to decorate the vault of a large chamber in the guildhall of the judges and notaries (destroyed), Florence. In the same period Jacopo probably created the altarpiece with the Crucifixion (1366-68; London, National Gallery), although the execution of the outer groups of figures and the mounted groups was left to Simone, a collaborator."
2465,JACOPO DA EMPOLI,"(b. 1551, Firenze, d. 1640, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/empoli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, actually Jacopo Chimenti. He lived and worked in Florence all his life, and he followed Santi di Tito in the return to the clarity of the Florentine High Renaissance. He absorbed the ideas of his more innovative contemporaries and became one of the most popular painters of altarpieces for churches in Florence and Tuscany. He was also a distinguished still-life painter and received many commissions from private patrons, among them the Medici. Jacopo da Empoli's painting is distinguished by simple, lucid forms, strong colour and direct and clear interpretation of the subject.



"
2466,JACOPO DA MONTAGNANA,"(b. ca. 1445, Montagnana, d. 1499, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/montagna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He began his career in Padua, where between 1458 and 1461 he was trained by the little-known Bolognese artist Francesco Brazalieri (1410-after 1484). According to Vasari and Ridolfi he was a pupil of Giovanni Bellini; although no formal relationship is documented, it is clear that Jacopo was strongly influenced by the Venetian painter. The dominant influence on his art, however, was Andrea Mantegna, whose altarpiece for San Zeno, Verona, was painted in Padua in 1457-59. Jacopo is recorded in 1469 as a member of the painters' guild of Padua. His principal surviving and securely attributed works are nearly all frescoes in Padua, Belluno and Monteorte. A wider range of his activities is suggested by the papal vestments (Padua, Santo) that he designed for Sixtus IV in 1472.



"
2467,JACOPO DELLA PILA,(active 1472-1502 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/pila/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor from Milan, active in Naples. Stylistic similarities with sculpture in Rome between 1450 and 1470, particularly with the style of Isaia da Pisa and Andrea Bregno, lead to the assumption of a hypothesis of a Roman formation before his arrival in Naples. His first certain work is the sepulchral monument of Bishop Nicola Piscitelli in the Cathedral of Salerno (dated 1472)."
2468,JACOPO del SELLAIO,"(b. ca. 1441, Firenze, d. 1493, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/sellaio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Jacopo di Arcangelo di Jacopo. He was the son of Arcangelo, a saddler (sellaio). He is first mentioned in his father's catasto (land registry declaration) of 1446 as a child of five. By 1460 he had joined the Compagnia di S Luca in Florence, and in October 1473 he appears in their records sharing a studio with Filippo di Giuliano (fl 1473-91). Vasari describes both Sellaio and Botticelli as fellow pupils of Fra Filippo Lippi."
2469,JACOPO DA VALENZA,(active 1485-1509 in the Veneto),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacopo/valenza/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Vittorio Veneto, Feltre and Belluno. He worked in many churches in Belluno in a style strongly influenced by Alvise Vivarini."
2470,"JACQUAND, Claudius","(b. 1803, Lyon, d. 1878, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacquand/biograph.html,"
French painter, designer and printmaker. In 1821 he entered the atelier of Fleury Richard in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Lyon. He exhibited for the first time at the Lyon Salon of 1822, in 1824 receiving a first-class medal at the Paris Salon for a Prison Courtyard (untraced). He lived in Lyon until his mother's death in 1836, when he settled in Paris."
2471,"JACQUE, Charles Émile","(b. 1813, Paris, d. 1894, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacque/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. In 1830, following a difficult childhood, Jacque was apprenticed at the age of seventeen to an engraver of maps and learned the technique of dry point. That same year, he produced his first etching, a copy of a head after Rembrandt. Disappointed by his apprenticeship, he enlisted in the army from 1831 to 1836. During his military service he made some sketches and drawings which he later tried to have published and he is reputed to have submitted two works to the Salon of 1833 in Paris."
2472,JACQUEMART DE HESDIN,(d. c. 1411),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacquema/biograph.html,"
Jacquemart du Hesdin was a painter to the Duke of Berry from 1384 until 1411, when he was succeeded by the Limbourg brothers. He made the Grandes Heures du Duc de Berry (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale), as well as the Très Belles Heures (Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale), but is principally remembered as having started what became the Hours of Turin.


"
2473,"JACQUET, Mathieu","(b. ca. 1545, Avon, d. after 1611, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacquet/biograph.html,"
Mathieu Jacquet, part of a French family of sculptors. They probably came from Grenoble and were active in Paris and the surrounding region from the 16th century to the end of the 17th. Antoine Jacquet, also known as Antoine de Grenoble (c. 1500-c. 1572), was a sculptor, mason and architect. He worked at the château of Fontainebleau from 1538, executing stucco decoration, providing architectural models and casting bronze. Among his other works was ornamental sculpture executed under the direction of Francesco Primaticcio for the tomb of Henry II in Saint-Denis Abbey. His son Mathieu Jacquet, a contemporary of Germain Pilon, was the most eminent member of the family."
2474,"JACQUOT, Georges","(b. 1794, Nancy, d. 1874, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jacquot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was the pupil of the painter Antoine-Jean Gros and the sculptor François-Joseph Bosio. In 1820 he won in sculpture the Premier Grand Prix de Rome with his statue of Cain the Damned.



"
2475,"JADOT, Jean-Nicolas","(b. 1710, Luneville, d. 1761, Ville–Issey)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jadot/biograph.html,"
Jean-Nicolas Jadot de Ville Issey, French architect from Lorraine. Trained by Germain Boffrand (1667-1754), he settled in Vienna under the aegis of Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine (1708-65) and consort of Maria Theresia (reigned 1740-80). Jadot designed the Arco San Gallo, Florence (1738-39), to commemorate Francis Stephen's accession to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1739), and, after he arrived in Vienna, was the architect of the Alte Aula, or Old University (later Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1753-55), and the Schönbrunn Menagerie, both in the Louis XV style. He may have been the author of the plan for the Royal Palace in Budapest (1749).



"
2476,"JAERSVELT, Reijnier van",(active 1528-1576 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jaersvel/biograph.html,"
Flemish goldsmith. He was one of the most important 16th-century goldsmiths in Antwerp, known for both religious and civil objects of very high artistic and technical level.



"
2477,"JÄGER, Franz, I","(b. 1743, Wien, d. 1809. Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jager/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect and stonemason. He was the court master mason of the Franzensburg, a complex of buildings which was erected by Franz II (I) in the palace gardens of Laxenburg. No other biographical data are available.



"
2478,"JALEY, Jean-Louis-Nicolas","(b. 1802, Paris, d. 1866, Neuilly)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jaley/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was a pupil of his father, Louis Jaley (1763-1838), a medal engraver, and of Pierre Cartellier. In 1820 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, winning the Prix de Rome in 1827 with the relief Mucius Scaevola before Porsenna (École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris). His stay in Rome profoundly affected his style, which was influenced by the sculpture of antiquity and the paintings of Raphael."
2479,"JALLIER, Noël",(active 1546-1550),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jallier/biograph.html,"
French painter. In 1550 he was paid for 14 large history paintings in the château of Oiron, Deux-Sèvres. These have been identified with the series painted a secco in the gallery in the north wing of the château, rediscovered in 1974. Painted in 1546-49 for Claude Gouffier, Grand Ecuyer of France, and dedicated to Francis I, they illustrate episodes from the History of Troy as described in Virgil's Aeneid. The ensemble was clearly inspired by the decorations of the Galerie François I at the château of Fontainebleau, but while the figure style is indebted to that of Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio, the composition and elaborate illusionistic painted framing reveal knowledge of contemporary Roman decorative cycles by such artists as Perino del Vaga and Daniele da Volterra. This led to the suggestion that Jallier may have visited Rome in the course of executing the paintings."
2480,"JAMNITZER, Wenzel","(b. ca. 1507, Wien, d. 1585, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jamnitze/biograph.html,"
Wenzel Jamnitzer I belonged to a German family of gold- and silversmiths, sculptors, designers and draughtsmen. Hans Jamnitzer I (d. 1549), a goldsmith of Vienna, settled his family in Nuremberg, where his descendants worked successfully for at least three generations. The most notable member of the family was his son Wenzel Jamnitzer I."
2481,"JANNECK, Franz Christoph","(b. 1703, Graz, d. 1761, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janneck/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He was a pupil of Matthias Vangus (fl 1716) in Graz before he came to Vienna, where he was first mentioned in documents of the 1730s. His younger brother, Matthias Jakob, studied at the Viennese academy in 1728-30 and in 1733. About 1735 Janneck travelled in Austria and southern Germany; in Frankfurt am Main he met Karl Aigen (1684-1762), Christian Hilfgott Brand and Josef Orient (1677-1747). In 1740 he studied at the Viennese academy, joining the Frey-Compagnie (a voluntary military company) in 1741. With Paul Troger, and later with Michelangelo Unterberger, he held the office of assessor at the academy between 1752 and 1758."
2482,"JANSSENS, Jan Willem","(b. 1590, Ghent, d. ca. 1650, Ghent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janssen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active also in Italy. He became a master in the painters' guild of his native Ghent in 1621, but before that he spent considerable time in Italy, particularly Rome, where he is documented in 1619 and 1620. There he became associated with the international Caravaggesque movement and was especially influenced by the paintings of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, such as Gerrit van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen."
2483,"JANSSENS, Hieronymus","(b. 1624, Antwerpen, d. 1693, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janssenh/biograph.html,"
Hieronymus (Jeroom) Janssens, Flemish painter. In 1636-37 he was a pupil of Christoffel van der Lamen (1606-52), and by 1643-44 he was a master. He married Catharina van Dooren in 1650 and took on four pupils in the year 1651-52. Like van der Lamen, he specialized in dance scenes, set either inside a palace or outside on a terrace (e.g. the Game of Hot-cockles, 1656; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels), and was thus nicknamed 'the dancer' (den Danser)."
2484,"JANSSENS, Abraham","(b. 1575, Antwerpen, d. 1632, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janssens/abraham1/biograph.html,"
Abraham Janssens (also Abraham Janssens van Nuyssen or Abraham Janssens I), Flemish figure and portrait painter, active mainly in Antwerp. He was in Rome in 1598 and back in Antwerp by 1601. A second visit to Italy seems likely, for although in 1601 he was painting in a Mannerist style (Diana and Callisto, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest), by 1909 (Scaldis and Antwerpia, Musée Royal, Antwerp) his work had become much more solid, sober, and classical, suggesting close knowledge of Caravaggio in particular. For the next decade Janssens was one of the most powerful and individual painters in Flanders, but during the 1620s his work became less remarkable as he fell under the all-pervasive influence of Rubens. His pupils included Gerard Seghers and Theodoor Rombouts. His son, Abraham Janssens II was also painter and pupil of his father.



"
2485,"JANSSENS, Abraham II","(b. 1616, Antwerpen, d. after 1649, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janssens/abraham2/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Abraham Janssens van Nuyssen. He became a Master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke around 1636 and also worked as an art dealer. After the death of Janssens the Elder in 1632, he took over the running of his father's workshop. Like his father, Janssens travelled to Rome and studied antique sculpture and the art of Michelangelo and Raphael. He lived and worked in the city for a period of about ten years up to 1649, at one point residing with his friend, the Dutch landscape painter Johannes Lingelbach."
2486,"JANSSENS, Victor Honoré","(b. 1658, Bruxelles, d. 1736, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/janssenv/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman. He was apprenticed to Lancelot Volders (fl 1657-?75) in Brussels from 1668 to 1675. He also studied with the Dutchman Pieter Molyn. He came under the patronage of Herzog Joachim II von Holstein-Plön, who supported his trip to Italy. In Rome he studied the works of Raphael and the ancient monuments and made drawings of the Roman Campagna. His highly popular small paintings were influenced by those of Francesco Albani. Janssens also painted a large altarpiece for the Jesuits of Naples.

She was employed until 1842 at the Sèvres factory where she worked initially as an anonymous painter of cups and plates in the cameo style but gradually became a renowned painter of coloured figures on porcelain plaques. While at Sèvres she received private commissions and trained pupils in her Paris studio.



"
2490,"JÄRNEFELT, Eero","(b. 1863, Viipuri, d. 1937, Helsinki)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jarnefel/biograph.html,"
Finnish painter. He was born Viipuri (now Vyborg and part of Russia), Finland to August Aleksander Järnefelt, an officer in the Russian army and Elisabeth Järnefelt (née Clodt von Jürgensburg). He studied at the St. Petersburg art academy under his uncle Mikhail Klodt (1835-1914) between 1883 and 1885. Klodt's love of sky and clouds influenced Järnefelt considerably. His sister Aino Järnefelt married composer Jean Sibelius in 1892 and remained with him until his death."
2491,JEAN DE BEAUMETZ,"(b. ca. 1335, Beaumetz-les-Loges, d. 1396, Dijon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jean/beaumetz/biograph.html,"
Franco-Flemish painter. He was first recorded living in Arras, where by 1360 he had married and was receiving rents. In June 1361 Beaumetz was granted residency in Valenciennes, and by August he had painted a statue (destroyed) that had been restored by the sculptor André Beauneveu for the aldermen's hall. In 1371 Beaumetz was in Paris carrying out unspecified works for Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. The Duke had sent him to Burgundy by 1375, and by April 1376 he was named ducal painter to replace Jean d'Arbois."

2493,JEAN DE LIÈGE,(active 1361-1381),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jean/liege/biograph.html,"
French sculptor of Flemish origin, also known as Hennequin de Liège. he is not to be confused with a Franco-Flemish sculptor of the same name, working in Dijon. He was a past master in his native region in funerary art, and appeared in Paris in 1361, collaborating on the execution of a statue of Jeanne de Bretagne for the chapel of the Dominicans in Orléans. His prestige evidently grew rapidly, since in 1364 he worked for the king on the great staircase of the Louvre, where he was responsible for the statues of the king and queen. Afterwards he built the tomb of the heart of Charles V for the choir of Rouen Cathedral. This marked the beginning of a continuous activity in the service of the king until his death in 1381."
2494,JEAN LE NOIR,(active 1331-1375 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jean/noir/biograph.html,"
French illuminator, a pupil of Jean Pucelle. He is first mentioned in 1331, in the service of Yoland of Flanders, Duchess of Bar. Later he left her employ to work for King John II of France (reigned 1350-64). In 1358, during John's imprisonment in London, he and his daughter Bourgot, who is also mentioned as an illuminator ('enlumineresse'), were given a house in Paris by the regent Charles, in recognition of services rendered to the King. In 1372 Jean Le Noir received gifts from Jean, Duc de Berry, for whom he must have been working at the time. Again, in a document of 1375, while living in Bourges, he is said to have received gifts from the Duc and is referred to as 'illuminator to the King and to the Duc'."
2495,"JEAURAT, Etienne","(b. 1699, Paris, d. 1789, Versailles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jeaurat/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. He was a favourite pupil of Nicolas Vleughels, who, when appointed director of the Académie Française in Rome in 1724, took Jeaurat with him, though it is hard to discern any Italian influence at all in Jeaurat's work. Jeaurat was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale, Paris, in 1731 and was received (reçu) two years later as a history painter with his Pyramis and Thisbe (1733; Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'Archéologie Déchelette, Roanne). Jeaurat rose to the highest posts in the Académie, becoming professor in 1743, rector in 1765 and chancellor in 1781. He exhibited regularly at the Salon between 1737 and 1769, and the Gobelins factory made tapestries after his designs. Unlike his exact contemporary Chardin, whom tried to imitate, Jeaurat had a highly successful official career with his many posts."
2496,"JEFFERSON, Thomas","(b. 1743, Shadwell, d. 1826, Monticello)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jefferso/biograph.html,"

2497,"JEFFERYS, Thomas",(c. 1719–1771),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jefferys/biograph.html,"
English cartographer and engraver. He was one of the most prominent and prolific map compliers and engravers of his day. Our first records of Jefferys appear in the 1735 when he was apprenticed to Emmual Bowen. Later, in the 1740s he is known to have engraved several maps of the popular ""Gentlemans' Magazine"". Around 1740 Jefferys was finally able to go into business for himself and in 1746 was appointed ""Geographer to Fredrick, Prince of Wales"", which shortly after translated to the position of ""Royal Cartographer to King George the III"". While not specifically a cartographer, Jefferys specialized in compiling and re-engraving the works of various cartographers into coherent cartographic wholes. While not salaried position, Jefferys appointment as ""Royal Cartographer"" did give him preferential treatment as well as access to the most up to date cartographic material available."
2498,"JEGHER, Christoffel","(b. 1596, Antwerpen, d. 1653, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jegher/biograph.html,"

Jegher's woodcuts appear in the Plantin Missals of 1626, 1628 and 1632, and in the Breviaries of 1627, 1631, 1632, 1636 and 1642. He also completed nearly 50 woodcuts for Juan Eusebio Nieremberg's 'Historia naturae', published in 1635."

Danish painter. Apart from his many copies of Old Masters, he is exceptional in Danish art of his time in devoting himself solely to portrait painting. He went to Copenhagen c. 1810 to study at the Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi, where he was taught by Christian August Lorentzen (1749-1828), with whom he also studied privately. In 1816 Jensen embarked on an extended educational journey to Rome where he met the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. In Rome he painted a series of small, intimate portraits of acquaintances, and in these paintings he developed his own style. His masterpiece is his portrait of the sculptor Hermann Ernst Freund (1819; Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen), in which he depicted his good friend and colleague as a romantic artist, with open-neck shirt, beret and long hair. Although the portrait is small in scale, it is detailed in its characterization."

Danish sculptor whose full name was Emil Jens Baumann Adolf Jerichau. He received his art education initially at the Academy in Copenhagen and from 1839 in Rome, becoming a pupil of his distinguished compatriot Thorvaldsen. He established his calling through a bas-relief on a frieze in a royal castle in Christiansborg near Copenhagen, depicting the marriage of Alexander the Great to Roxane. His colossal sculpture Hercules and Hebe as well as a marble statue of Penelope are in a strong classical style. He created a splendid depiction of nature in a sculpture depicting a panther attacking a hunter."

Danish painter. She was born in Poland from German parents as Anna Maria Elisabeth Lisinska Baumann, married to the sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau. Her father Philip Adolph Baumann (1776-1863) was a mapmaker,"
2502,"JERVAS, Charles","(b. ca. 1675, Dublin, d. 1739, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jervas/biograph.html,"
Irish painter and collector, active in England. From 1694 to 1695 he was Godfrey Kneller's pupil and assistant in London. Around 1698 he painted small copies (Oxford, All Souls, Codrington Lib.) of the Raphael cartoons at Hampton Court Palace, which he sold to Dr George Clarke of All Souls, Oxford. In 1699 he went to Rome via Paris, funded by Dr Clarke and others."
2503,"JIMÉNEZ ARANDA, José","(b. 1837, Sevilla, d. 1903, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jimenez/jose/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, sibling of Luis Jiménez Aranda. He trained in Seville under Manuel Cabral (1828-1891) and with Eduardo Cano de la Peña (1823-1897), showing an early interest in genre painting. This was perhaps due to the tradition of Romanticism in Seville, and Jiménez Aranda was already exhibiting pictures of this type at the Exposición Nacional in Madrid in 1864."
2504,"JIMÉNEZ Y ARANDA, Luis","(b. 1845, Sevilla, d. 1928, Pontoise)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jimenez/luis/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter of historical genre and naturalist subjects. He was the younger brother of painter José Jiménez Aranda, whose meticulously rendered historical genre paintings greatly influenced the young Luis. "

2506,"JODE, Pieter de, II","(b. 1606, Antwerpen, d. after 1674, England)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jode/pieter2/biograph.html,"
Flemish engraver and publisher, part of a family of printmakers and publishers, son of Pieter de Jode I, grandson of the famous cartographer and printmaker Gerard de Jode (c. 1513-1591). A scion of an important dynasty of printmakers active in Antwerp, he created many prints after the works of leading painters and was a close collaborator of Anthony van Dyck for whom he engraved many portraits."
2507,"JOHANSEN, Viggo","(b. 1851, København, d. 1935, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/johansen/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He trained at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster from 1868 to 1875 under Jørgen Roed (1808-1888). In 1871 he began to visit the fishing hamlet of Hornbaek on the north coast of Zealand, not far from Copenhagen, often with painters such as Peter Severin Krøyer and Kristian Zahrtmann (1843-1917). Here Johansen painted pure landscapes, or alternatively figures from the village's traditional population, seen in their homes. A Meal (1877; Copenhagen, Hirschsprungske Samling) shows an elderly fisherman seated at table eating potatoes, attended by his wife; dull daylight from a window in which a net is drying illumines the frugal interior and worn figures."
2508,"JOLI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1700, Modena, d. 1777, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He first studied in Modena with il Menia (Raffaello Rinaldi; fl 1713). After a period in Rome in the studios of a member of the Galli-Bibiena family and of Giovanni Paolo Panini he worked as a scene painter in Modena and Perugia. By 1735 he was in Venice, where he came into contact with Canaletto and again worked as a scene painter. He travelled widely in Europe, and from Germany went to London, where he lived from 1744 to 1748. He had a managerial position at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, and decorated the Richmond mansion of its director, John James Heidegger, with view paintings (in situ). In London he also produced topographical paintings. From 1750 to 1754 he worked in Madrid.

2509,"JONES, Thomas","(b. 1742, Trevonen, Wales, d. 1803, Pencerrig, Wales)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jones/biograph.html,"
Thomas Jones was a Welsh landscape painter who was a pupil of Richards Wilson, 1763-65, and went to the Royal Academy Schools from 1769. He was in Naples and Rome 1776-83 (his memoirs of this period were published in 1951), and there he painted small landscapes on the spot, very like those to be painted much later by Michallon, Valenciennes or even Corot. He gave up painting professionally on his return to London, but continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy, 1784-88, and in 1798. There are six of his Corot-like landscapes in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff.



"
2510,"JONES, Inigo","(b. 1573, London, d. 1652, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jones_in/biograph.html,"
English architect, designer, and painter. During his lifetime Inigo Jones was celebrated as a designer of entertainments for the courts of James I and Charles I, but his posthumous reputation rests largely on his architectural projects. One of the first Englishmen to intensely study the architecture of ancient Rome and that of the Italian classical architects, Jones created his own rigorous interpretation of the classical language of architecture. His influence was curtailed by the English Civil War, but enjoyed a great revival among 18th-century Palladian architects. Important projects include the Banqueting House in Whitehall, the Queen's Chapel at St James's Palace, and a tower and portico at Old St. Peter's.



"
2511,"JONES, John",(active 1780-1791 in London),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jones_j/biograph.html,"
Jones was a London-based English engraver and printseller who practiced in both mezzotint and stipple. During his industrious career he mainly engraved portraits, working from paintings by Reynolds, Romney and Gainsborough. The majority of his work he published himself at his residence in Great Portland Street. He was an active exhibitor at the Society of Artists and from 1780-1791 served as Engraver Extraordinary to the Prince of Wales.



"
2512,"JONGH, Ludolf de","(b. 1616, Overschie, d. 1679, Hillegersberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jongh/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, who studied with Delft portraitist Cornelis Saftleven in Rotterdam and a Caravaggesque painter in Utrecht, then from 1635, he studied for seven years in France. His known earliest paintings were executed in Rotterdam around 1642 and were portraits and genre subjects. By the late 1640s, his genre subjects and hunting scenes show the influence of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, especially Jacob Duck."
2513,"JONGHE, Gustave Léonard de","(b. 1829, Kortrijk, d. 1893, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jonghe/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. In 1855, he left Belgium for Paris, where he exhibited at the Salon of French Artists during the next thirty years. He started his career painting historical and sacred subject matter, but later specialized in portraits, historical genre and family scenes. He presented at the Salon a lot of paintings, featuring bourgeois families in luxury interiors. Throughout his career, he used this kind of grand interior to give him the opportunity to exercise his observational and painterly skills with great flair."
2514,"JONGHELINCK, Jacques","(b. 1530, Antwerpen, d. 1606, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jongheli/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor and medallist. He moved from Antwerp to set up a workshop in Brussels in 1562 and was appointed court sculptor the following year. In Brussels he specialized in funeral monuments for an aristocratic clientele and was also a successful merchant, and financier. He belonged to the immediate entourage of the diplomat Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, president of the council of state from 1556 to 1564."
2515,"JONGKIND, Johan Barthold","(b. 1819, Lattrop, d. 1891, La Côte-Saint-André)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jongkind/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and printmaker. After training and working briefly as a notary's clerk, he studied from 1836 at the Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague, where he befriended Charles Rochussen and was especially influenced in his watercolour technique by the work of the Director, Andreas Schelfhout. Among his early wash drawings, Embarkation (1844; The Hague, Gemeentemuseum) provides evidence of a developed sense of this medium."
2516,"JONSON VAN CEULEN, Cornelius the Elder","(b. 1593, London, d. 1661, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jonson/elder/biograph.html,"

Anglo-Flemish portrait painter born in London of Flemish parents (also called Cornelis Johnson or Janssen van Ceulen). He was the son of Cornelis Jonson of Antwerp and Jane Le Grand, who had fled to London to escape religious persecution. His grandfather Peter Jansen originally came from Cologne, so the family often used the name Jonson van Ceulen. Cornelis Jonson probably trained as a painter in the northern Netherlands, returning to London about 1618, where he worked for the next 25 years as a portrait painter, and had an extensive practice. His signed or monogrammed portraits number several hundred; he is the first English-born painter known to have made so many. Anthony van Dyck's dazzling manner influenced him, but Jonson's style remained more straightforward, a somewhat conservative approach that appealed to his patrons in the higher, but not the highest, social circles."
2517,"JONSON VAN CEULEN, Cornelius the Younger","(b. 1634, London, d. 1715, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jonson/younger/biograph.html,"
Anglo-Dutch portrait painter, son of Cornelis Jonson van Ceulen the Elder. He was born in London, but his family moved to the Netherlands in 1643, and he presumably trained there with his father. In 1664, he was living with his mother in Utrecht, where he was also documented in 1670, 1678, and 1698. He was buried in the Jacobskerk, Utrecht in 1715."
2518,JOOS van Wassenhove,(active c.1460-80),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joos/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, part of whose career was spent in Italy, where he was known as Giusto da Guanto (Justus of Ghent). He became a member of the Antwerp Guild in 1460, but by 1464 had moved to Ghent, where he was a friend of Hugo van der Goes. At some time after 1468 he went to Rome, and by 1472 had settled in Urbino, where he worked for Duke Federico da Montefeltro."
2519,"JORDAENS, Hans III","(b. 1595, Antwerpen, d. 1643, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jordaen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He trained with his father, Hans Jordaens II (bapt Antwerp, 1581; d Antwerp, 1635), who was also a painter. On 26 November 1617 Hans III married Maria van Dijck, by whom he had five children. In 1620 he enrolled in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He appears to have been a fairly successful painter: although his father is said to have been a poor man, Hans III was living in a large house in 1624."
2520,"JORDAENS, Jacob","(b. 1593, Antwerpen, d. 1678, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jordaens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, the pupil and son-in-law of Adam van Noort. Although Jordaens often assisted Rubens, he had a flourishing studio of his own by the 1620s, and after Rubens's death in 1640 he was the leading figure painter in Flanders. His style was heavily indebted to Rubens, but was much more earthbound, using thick impasto, strong contrasts of light and shade, and colouring that is often rather lurid. His physical types, too, are coarser than Rubens's and his name is particularly associated with large canvases of hearty rollicking peasants. Two of his favourite subjects, which he depicted several times are The Satyr and the Peasant, based on one of Aesop's fables, and The King Drinks, which depicts a boisterous group enjoying an abundant Twelfth Night feast. Jordaens's prolific output, however, included many other subjects, including religious works and portraits, and he also etched and made designs for tapestries."
2521,"JORDAN, Esteban","(b. ca. 1529, León, d. ca. 1598, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jordan/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He was one of the leading sculptors in the second half of the 16th century based in Valladolid. He probably trained in León, and the classical style apparent in his works may have been derived from Gaspar Becerra, who was in Valladolid in 1557. Jordán's first documented work is a retable (1556–62) at Paredes de Nava, on which he collaborated with Inocencio Berruguete (fl 1540–63). He received commissions from other centres such as Medina del Campo, Alaejos, León, Avila and Monserrat. From about 1577 to 1590 he completed the retable started by Juan de Juni, who was an important influence on him, in the church of S Maria del Mediavilla, Medina de Ríoseco. Jordán was also responsible for the alabaster reliefs and wood figures on the trascoro (completed 1585) of León Cathedral. His commissions in Valladolid include the alabaster tomb of Don Juan de Ortega in Santi Spiritus, which was commissioned in conjunction with the retable of the Annunciation in the same church in about 1582."
2522,"JORIS, Pio","(b. 1843, Roma, d. 1921, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joris/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. While still very young, Pio Joris attended the Istituto di Belle Arti in Rome and in 1861 he enrolled at the Accademia di San Luca, where he remained for just a year. On a visit to the 1st Esposizione Nazionale di Belle Arti di Firenze in 1861 he was attracted by the naturalistic works from the Naples school. He came into contact with Domenico Morelli and Filippo Palizzi during a trip to Capri, Sorrento and Naples in 1866. In Rome, he kept company with Mariano Fortuny, whose painting, with its pleasant, captivating luministic effects, made a very strong impression on Joris. That was how he developed his own very personal artistic language, which went on to bring him remarkable commercial success on an international scale, helped by his collaboration with Paris art dealer Alphonse Goupil."
2523,"JOSEPH, Samuel",(1791-1850),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joseph/biograph.html,"
Samuel Joseph was an English sculptor and medalist. He made funeral monuments and many portrait medalions of famous contemporary artists and other personages.

2524,"JOSEPHSON, Ernst","(b. 1851, Stockholm, d. 1906, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/josephso/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter, draughtsman and poet. He came from a culturally distinguished Jewish family and trained (1867-76) at the Akademi för de Fria Konsterna in Stockholm. Frequent journeys in western and northern Europe allowed him to copy Old Master paintings, and he studied briefly with Jean-Léon Gérôme at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1874. He copied especially works by Velázquez, Raphael, Titian and above all Rembrandt, whom he took as his principal model both as colourist and as a draughtsman."
2525,"JOUBERT, Gilles","(b. 1689, Paris, d. 1775, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joubert/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker. He was a member of a Parisian family of menuisiers and became a maître-ébéniste sometime between 1714 and 1722. After the death of Antoine-Robert Gaudreaus (1751) he became the main supplier to the Crown for 23 years and carried out commissions for 4000 pieces of furniture. Only a few, however, were masterpieces, produced either by Joubert or under his supervision."
2526,"JOUDERVILLE, Isaac de","(b. ca. 1613, Leiden, d. ca. 1645, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/joudervi/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, a pupil of Rembrandt. He was active in Leiden (1629-31), Amsterdam (1631-32), Leiden (1632-41), Deventer (1641-43), and Amsterdam (1643-45). He was entrusted to Rembrandt's care in Leiden at a young age. He moved to Amsterdam around the same time as Rembrandt and disappeared into a limbo from which he was not rescued until the end of the nineteenth century, when his single painting bearing his signature was found. In his early work the motifs are closely observed and described in minute, even painful detail. There is a certain dryness and sharpness in the definition of form. He painted smallish figures on panel, as Rembrandt did.



"
2527,"JOUVENET, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1644, Rouen, d. 1717, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jouvenet/biograph.html,"
French painter, the outstanding member of a family of artists from Rouen. He went to Paris in 1661 and joined the studio of Lebrun. His early works, including decorations for the Salon de Mars at Versailles, were closely imitative of the style of Lebrun and Eustache Le Sueur (St Bruno in Prayer, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm). He was the most distinguished of the group of artists who collaborated with La Fosse in the decorations at Trianon and Les Invalides, but he is now best remembered as the leading French religious painter of his generation, carrying out numerous major commissions for churches in Paris and elsewhere. His later work was marked both by Baroque emotionalism and by a realistic treatment of details foreign to the principles encouraged by the Academy. It is recorded, for example, that before painting his Miraculous Draught of Fishes he studied fishing scenes on the spot at Dieppe.



"
2528,JUAN DE FLANDES,"(b. ca. 1465, ?, d. 1519, Palencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juan/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter active in Spain from 1496. He was one of a number of north European artists trained in the Ghent-Bruges school employed by Queen Isabella. The only indications of his early life are his style as a painter and the generic name (John of Flanders) given him in Spain. Even his twenty-three years in Castile are sparsely documented and known mostly through contracts and official records. He is first recorded in the payrolls of Isabella's servants in 1496 and stayed on at court until her death eights later. He was appointed court painter in 1498. Little remains of this period of activity except for the altarpiece of St John the Baptist, executed or the Charterhouse of Miraflores (surviving panels in the Museum van der Bergh, Antwerp, Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva, and private collection), and part of the magnificent, now dismembered and scattered work of art, known as the Polyptych of Isabella the Catholic. A miniature altarpiece he painted for her was once much renowned, but is now dismembered and scattered; a characteristic panel from it, Christ Crowned with Thorns (Detroit Institute of Arts), shows his delicate miniaturistic style.

Juan de Colonia or Johannes (Hans) von Köln, German architect active in Spain. About 1440, he was invited by Alfonso de Cartagena, then bishop of Burgos, to work on Burgos Cathedral. He also worked on the reconstruction of Miraflores Charterhouse."
2530,"JUANES, Juan de","(b. ca. 1523, Fuente de la Higuera, d. 1579, Bocairente)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juanes/biograph.html,"
Juan de Juanes was a Spanish painter, the son of the painter Vicente Macip (c.1475-c.1545), who had almost certainly studied in Italy, and probably in Venice. Juanes painted 'ideal' Counter-Reformation images, based on Leonardo's Last Supper (engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi) and Raphael's Madonnas, but also with some influence from Flanders, e.g. Quentin Massys.
"
2531,"JUEL, Jens Jørgensen","(b. 1745, Balslev, Fünen, d. 1802, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juel/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. Noted for his landscapes and portraits, he painted compositionally balanced works in a harmonious palette, continuing a classical painterly tradition. The son of a vicar at Gamborg on Funen, Juel went to Hamburg (then under Danish sovereignty), where he studied under the German artist Johann Michael Gehrmann (d 1770). In 1765 he briefly returned to Fünen and then to Copenhagen, where he studied at the Kunstakademi until 1771. While at the academy he came under the influence of Carl Gustaf Pilo, a professor there from 1748 and best known for his portraits of the Danish royal family. It was also at the academy that Juel perfected his considerable talent in drawing. Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge were Juel's students.



"
2532,"JULIEN, Pierre","(b. 1731, Saint-Paulien, d. 1804, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/julien/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied in Le Puy with the minor sculptor Gabriel Samuel (1689-1758) and in Lyon with Antoine-Michel Perrache (1726-79), who in 1758 recommended him to Guillaume Coustou in Paris. In 1765 Julien won the Prix de Rome with the relief Albinus Helping the Vestals to Flee the Gauls (untraced). After three years at the Ecole Royale des Eleves Protégés he went to the Académie de France in Rome (1768-72). Among his works from this time is a reduced copy (marble; Versailles, Château) of the antique statue Ariadne Abandoned, then known as Cleopatra."
2533,"JUNCKER, Johannes the Elder",(c. 1582-c. 1624),https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juncker/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, part of a Franconian artist family whose members were active from the end of the 16th century to the end of the 17th century. Members of the Juncker family (also Junker, Junckher, Yuncker, Guncker, Seaucker) worked at the representative offices of the regional elites in Franconia. Members were Michael Juncker the Elder (born in 1550s), Johannes the Elder (c. 1582-c. 1624), Zacharias the Elder (c. 1578-1665), Zacharias the Younger (1622-1685) and Valentin (1585-1651)"
2534,"JUNI, Juan de","(b. 1506, Joigny, d. 1577, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juni/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, probably of Burgundian origin, active in Spain from c.1533. He worked at León and Salamanca before settling at Valladolid in 1540. He was a prolific sculptor of religious subjects, excelling in the dramatic expression of emotion, and is generally ranked next to Alonso Berruguete as the outstanding Spanish sculptor of his period. Berruguete himself called him 'the best foreign carver in Castile'. Juni's most famous works are probably the two groups of the Entombment in Valladolid Museum (1539-44) and Segovia Cathedral (1571).



"
2535,"JUSSOW, Heinrich Christoph","(b. 1754, Kassel, d. 1825, Kassel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/jussow/biograph.html,"
German architect. From 1771 to 1778 he studied law in Göttingen and Marburg. He continued his studies in Kassel where he learnt mathematics and Drawing, against the will of his parents. From 1781 he was a teacher at the Kassel Kunstakademie. After this activity he spent several years abroad."
2536,"JUVARRA, Filippo","(b. 1678, Messina, d. 1736, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/j/juvarra/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and scenographer, active in Rome, Turin, and Madrid. He was an important and influential Baroque architect who introduced elements of the Rococo architectural style. His work reinforced a Late Baroque classical tradition while also drawing on the leavening criticism of that tradition by Francesco Borromini. His work is characterized by clarity and directness, his architectural conceptions defined by a drastically reduced structure and complex conglomerate spaces; his surfaces were adorned with elaborate decorative systems the originality of which pointed the way to a light-hearted Rococo. "
2537,"KAGER, Johann Matthias","(b. 1575, München, d. 1634, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kager/biograph.html,"
German painter and draughtsman. He trained in Munich (1588-98) as a painter of miniatures. He probably worked subsequently among a group of artists decorating the Munich Residenz according to Italian models. Kager's early works show the influence of Friedrich Sustris, Christoph Schwarz and Hans Rottenhammer I. There is no evidence that Kager himself visited Italy. His drawings from the first years of the 17th century show that he had studied the art of Rudolfine Prague, including the works of Bartholomäus Spranger and Hans von Aachen. Some copper engravings by Kager date from 1600 to 1603."
2538,"KALF, Willem","(b. 1619, Rotterdam, d. 1693, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kalf/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, one of the most celebrated of all sill-life painters. In 1642-46 he worked in Paris. On his return to the Netherlands he lived in Hoorn and then in 1653 settled in Amsterdam. His early works were modest kitchen and courtyard scenes, but he soon became the outstanding exponent of a type of still-life in which fruit and precious objects - porcelain, oriental rugs, Venetian glass - are arranged in grand Baroque displays. His pictures have often been compared with those of Vermeer because of his masterly handling of texture and his ability to manipulate warm and cool colours (he frequently contrasts the reddish browns in a carpet with the yellow of a peeled lemon and the blue and white of porcelain).



"
2539,"KAMPER, Godaert","(b. ca. 1613, Düsseldorf, d. 1679, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kamper/biograph.html,"
German painter active in the Netherlands. In 1633 he moved to Leiden, where he married in 1644. Between 1648 and 1658 he was a member of the Painters' Guild of Saint Luke in Leiden. In 1659 he moved to Amsterdam. From 1663-1672 he lived in Naarden, where he painted portraits, especially group portraits, among which that of the regents of the orphanage. In 1674 he returned to Leiden."
2540,"KARCHER, Giovanni",(active 1517-1562),https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/karcher/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Karcher was a Flemish tapestry weaver active in Italy. He organized with his brother Nicolas Karcher a large workshop for Ercole d'Este II, Duke of Ferrara and Modena. This workshop produced important series of tapestries, such as the famous Scipio tapestries after drawings by Giulio Romano.

Nicolas Karcher (Nicola Carchera), Flemish tapestry weaver active in Italy. From c. 1517 he and his brother Giovanni Karcher were working for the Este court in Ferrara, organizing a large workshop for Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena.

He produced numerous works for the churches of Antwerp, including two elegant marble reliefs of Our Lady of the Rosary (1688) for St Paulus and, in collaboration with Henricus-Franciscus Verbrugghen, a superb communion bench (marble, 1695) for St Jacob. It seems likely that between about 1702 and 1709 he worked abroad, possibly in England. Dating from the later part of his career are two carved confessionals (wood, 1711) for the Premonstratensian Abbey of Grimbergen, near Brussels, and the funerary monuments of Abbot C.-F. de Fourneau and Abbot A.-C. de Pallant (both marble, 1714-15; Leuven, St Gertrudis).

He first worked in Germany, where his sitters included the Electress Sophia Dorothea; the painting (untraced) is known from an engraving (London, British Museum) by William Faithorne, who also executed six mezzotints after him. In 1689 Kerseboom painted the prototype of the Hon. Robert Boyle (c. 1689; London, Royal Society), of which numerous versions exist; this portrait is one demonstration of his idiosyncracies: the long, angular face, the extended figures and an emphasis on accessories."

Flemish still-life and flower painter active in Antwerp, where he became a Guild member in 1645. He continued the traditions of his grandfather, Jan ""Velvet"" Brueghel, and was also influenced by Daniel Seghers. 

Jan van Kessel painted many animals (especially insects), garlands and bouquets of flowers, as well as some mythological scenes. His choice of subject leaned towards those which included animals and plants; for example, he painted Noah's Ark. He is best known for small, jewel-like pictures, often on copper, of insects or shells against a light background, executed with strong colour and great exactitude. Good examples of his prolific output are in Oxford (Ashmolean), Cambridge (Fitzwilliam), and Madrid (Prado).

2568,"KESSEL, Jan van","(b. 1641, Amsterdam, d. 1680, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kessel_j/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. He was a follower, and probably a pupil, of Jacob van Ruisdael and covered the same range of subjects painted by Ruisdael, with the exception of marine paintings. However, van Kessel is best known for his townscapes and panoramic views, as exemplified by the Sluice and the New City Ramparts of Amsterdam in Winter (Amsterdam, Historisches Museum) and the Bleaching Grounds near Haarlem (Brussels, Musée d'Art Ancienne). He imitated the water-mills and village scenes of his friend Meindert Hobbema, as well as the waterfalls of Allaert van Everdingen, the wooded landscapes of Jan Wynants and the winter scenes of Jan van de Capelle. Many of van Kessel's 120 surviving pictures, including The Avenue (Stuttgart, Staatsgalerie) and the Ford in the Woods (Dresden, Gemäldegalerie), were once attributed to van Ruisdael and these other masters (often with an authentic signature covered by the better-known name)."

Van Mander, who was well informed about him, mentions that he painted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth I for the Earl of Hertford in 1578, but the picture is not known. The portrait of Martin Frobisher (Bodleian Library, Oxford), however, is a good example of his work from his English period. Ketel's finest portraits are his group portraits (examples in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), which prefigure those of Frans Hals.

In 1542 he was made a master of the Antwerp Guild, where he spent the rest of his working life. His nephew, Adriaen Thomasz. Key (c. 1544 - after 1589), was probably his pupil. The latter became a master of the Antwerp Guild in 1568. Both artists were highly regarded in their day and did assured and solid portraits of famous people. Their religious works are less well known, and many of Willem's are known to have perished at the hands of iconoclasts.

On 3 July 1593 he was promoted to municipal mason and carpenter in succession to Willem den Abt. A year later he was called to Leiden to design a façade for the existing town hall: his work there is one of the richest examples of Dutch Mannerist architecture. "
2574,"KEYSER, Hendrick de","(b. 1565, Utrecht, d. 1621, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/keyser/hendrick/biograph.html,"
The outstanding Dutch sculptor and one of the leading Dutch architects of his period. Most of his career was spent in Amsterdam, where he was appointed municipal sculptor and architect in 1594. His most important buildings are the Zuiderkerk (South Church, 1606-14), Holland's first large Protestant Church, and the Westerkerk (West Church, 1620-38), which broke free from the Mannerist tradition, looking forward to the classicism of Jacob van Campen. The splendid towers of these two churches are still among Amsterdam's chief landmarks. As a sculptor, de Keyser excelled particularly as a portraitist in a soberly realistic style (Unknown Man, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1608), but his best-known work is the tomb of William the Silent (begun 1614) in the Niewe Kerk at Delft."

He was indeed, Amsterdam's leading portraitist before being overtaken in popularity by Rembrandt in the 1630s. His life-size portraits look stiff compared with Rembrandt's and he is more attractive and original on a small scale. Constantin Huygens and His Clerk (National Gallery, London, 1627) is an excellent example of one of his small portraits of full-length figures in an interior, forerunners of the conversation pieces. His small equestrian portraits were also a new type (Pieter Schout, Rijksmuseum, 1660).

Hungarian painter. He studied in 1827 at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna under Peter Krafft. In 1830 he settled in Szentes, then after a trip abroad he worked as a portrait painter (1833-36). In 1837 he moved to Pest, where he took part in founding the Artists Association of Pest, and his work appeared continuously in their exhibitions. In 1840 he exhibited portraits and Village Supper, in 1841 his pictures of Hunyadi after the Battle of Rigómezõ and István Dobó, in 1844 his genre work Poor Widow and in 1845 further portraits. In the Artists Association of Pest's exhibition of 1846 he showed his most popular work, János Pethes Jablonczay's Farewell to his Daughter at the Window of Leopoldschloss Gaol (1846; Budapest, Hungarian National Gallery), of which he was to paint more than 20 versions. This historical work, along with the Lost Sentry, would become symbols of national oppression after the suppression of the revolution of 1848-49."
2591,"KLEINER, Salomon","(b. 1703, Augsburg, d. 1761, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kleiner/biograph.html,"
German draughtsman and engraver. He was trained in Augsburg by Johann August Corvinus (1683-1738). In 1721 he drew a series of city views of Vienna, which were later (1724-25) reproduced as engravings in Viennese collections. In 1722-23 Kleiner worked for the imperial vice-chancellor Friedrich Karl von Schönborn, drawing the Schönborn family buildings in Austria for a large collection of engravings. From 1723 he worked for Lothar Franz von Schönborn, sketching the Schönborn palaces in Franconia; other work in the region included engraved designs for altars in Bamberg churches and in Dettelbach am Main.

German architect and landscape and portrait painter. He was court architect to Jérôme Bonaparte of Westphalia and to Louis I of Bavaria, for whom he built many structures in the Italian Renaissance and Neoclassical styles. His chief works in Munich were the Glyptothek (1815-30), the Pinakothek, and the Odeon (1828). In 1839 he began additions to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg."

German painter, sculptor, and etcher, known for his use of symbol, fantasy, and dreams. Before 1886 he produced cycles of original and somewhat morbidly imaginative etchings, such as Deliverances of Sacrificial Victims Told in Ovid and Brahms-Phantasie. From 1886 to 1894 Klinger devoted himself primarily to painting, usually on a grandiose scale. Among his paintings are Judgment of Paris and Christ on Olympus (both: Vienna). After 1894 he worked predominantly in sculpture, his most successful medium. Notable examples are Salome, Cassandra, and the dramatic polychrome statue of Beethoven (all: Leipzig) and the bust of Nietzsche (Weimar)."
2594,"KLOCKER, Hans",(active 1478-1500 in South Tyrol),https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/klocker/biograph.html,"
Austrian wood-carver. Probably from Gais, South Tyrol, he was first recorded in Brixen (now Bressanone, Italy) in 1478 and can perhaps be identified with the Master Hans Maler who is mentioned many times in the cathedral records between 1477 and 1498. Rather than a panel painter, he is likely to have been a surveyor and head of a workshop producing complete altarpieces, including both sculpture and painting. In 1478-79 he employed four assistants and was one of the leading employers in Brixen. He also produced works for Bozen (now Bolzano, Italy) and its region. He was Mayor of Brixen in 1497-98; his last documented work (the retable of the former Franciscan church in Bolzano) dates from 1500.

He won a large Gold Medal from the Academy for his work, and received a scholarship for three years to study painting in France, Switzerland and Italy, but abandoned his trip a year later. On his return Klodt secured permission to use the rest of the scholarship funds to travel around Russia. "

He was an artillery officer but resigned his commission in 1828 in order to devote himself to sculpture. From 1830 he was a part-time student at the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg, where he attracted attention for his mastery in depicting horses. He soon began to receive major commissions. In 1838 he was elected an Academician and appointed to a teaching post at the Academy. He was a favourite sculptor of Nicholas I of Russia."

English painter and draftsman. He was a student of Jonathan Richardson the Elder (1665-1745). In 1740, he went to Italy and published an illustrated description of the excavations at Herculaneum. He became Keeper of paintings for the King's Pictures in 1765. With Arthur Pond, he made a series of engravings of the most famous paintings. The most notable of these are his landscapes after Guercino."

2599,"KNELLER, Sir Godfrey","(b. 1646, Lübeck, d. 1723, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kneller/biograph.html,"
German-born painter (originally Gottfried Kniller) who settled in England and became the leading portraitist there in the late 17th century and early 18th century. He studied in Amsterdam under Bol, a pupil of Rembrandt, and later in Italy, before moving to England, probably in the mid 1670s. The opportune death of serious rivals (notably Lely in 1680) and his own arrogant self-assurance enabled him to establish himself as the dominant court and society painter by the beginning of the reign of James II (1685). He was appointed Principal Painter jointly with Riley on the accession of William III and Mary II in 1689 (becoming sole bearer of the title when Riley died in 1691), was knighted in 1692, and created a baronet in 1715."

Dutch painter of Flemish origin, part of a family of painters. Documented as a painter in Haarlem in 1639, he became a member of the Guild of St Luke there in 1640. He was influenced by Jan van Goyen, not only in his subject-matter but also in his tonality, romantic light and use of perspective. Works of his have sometimes been confused with those of van Goyen (and occasionally deliberately misattributed), as in View of Dordrecht (1643; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), which carries a false van Goyen signature. The brushwork, however, is looser than that of van Goyen, the trees and clouds more manneristic and the rendering of the houses more detailed (e.g. in the brickwork)."

Dutch painter, part of a family of artists. He began his career in 1772 as a wallpaper painter in Tilburg and from 1786 was active in 's-Hertogenbosch. His work has an artisan character. He also painted signboards ('s-Hertogenbosch, Noordbrabants Museum). He worked with other artists such as Quirinus van Amelsfoort (1762-1820), to whose landscapes he sometimes added staffage (e.g. 's-Hertogenbosch, Stadhuis). Later he concentrated on flower and fruit still-lifes, which were of variable quality. He lost his sight in 1795.

2603,"KNIP, Henriëtte Geertruida","(b. 1783, Tilburg, d. 1842, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/knip/henriett/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists, daughter of Nicolaas Frederik Knip. Like her brother, Josephus Augustus Knip, she was taught by her father. In 1803 she left for Paris, where she received further training from Gerard van Spaendonck. She painted mostly fruit and flower still-lifes in watercolour; in this medium, at first strongly influenced by her second teacher, she produced work of outstanding quality. In 1806 she moved to Amsterdam and from 1810 on lived in Haarlem. Her works are not numerous, and many are in private collections. The Teylers Museum in Haarlem and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam each have two of her flower studies.



"
2604,"KNIP, Josephus Augustus","(b. 1777, Tilburg, d. 1847, Berlicum)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/knip/josephus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman, part of a family of artists, son of Nicolaas Frederik Knip. He is the best-known representative of the family. He started out as a wallpaper painter in the workshop of his father and left for Paris in 1801, where he produced mostly landscapes in gouache. In 1808 he married the French porcelain painter Pauline Rifer de Courcelles (1781-1851); the marriage was soon dissolved. Also in 1808 Knip won the Dutch Prix de Rome and spent time in Rome from 1809 on. There he produced over 500 works, primarily wash drawings of monuments and landscapes in and around Rome. These sheets, on which Knip's reputation rests, are drawn in a severe Neo-classical style with muted colour. They constituted a portfolio, on which he drew for the rest of his life: he combined unconnected motifs recorded in his portfolio, more or less arbitrarily, to compose his later paintings and large gouaches, for example Landscape near Ischia (1818; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) and View of La Cava (1817; Heino, Hannema-de Stuers Fundatie)."
2605,"KNIP, Mattheus Derk","(b. 1785, Tilburg, d. 1845, Vught)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/knip/mattheus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, son of Nicolaas Frederik Knip. He left for Paris in 1802 and remained there for four years. He is known to have produced mostly landscape gouaches there. Although he seldom signed his work, the majority of the great quantity of landscapes with Brabant, French and Swiss motifs from the Knip workshop must be ascribed to him on stylistic grounds."
2606,"KNIP, Henriëtte","(b. 1821, Amsterdam, d. 1909, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/knip/ronner/biograph.html,"
Henriëtte Ronner-Knip, Dutch painter and draughtswoman, part of a family of painters, daughter of Josephus Augustus Knip. She was a student of her father, and in her early years she painted mostly landscapes with Brabant motifs. In 1850 she married Teico Ronner and moved to Brussels, where she concentrated primarily on painting anecdotal scenes with dogs and, from 1870 on, exclusively with cats; in these paintings she also paid great attention to the background (e.g. Cat at Play; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). Her productivity in this genre was enormous. She was the most popular Dutch woman painter of her time and was internationally famous."

Dutch painter of German origin. Almost everything known of his life is based on an inscription on a single engraved portrait dated 1642. After initial training in Leipzig and elsewhere, in 1630 Knüpfer moved to Utrecht, where he studied with Mannerist painter Abraham Bloemaert. Aside from a possible trip to The Hague in the late 1640s, Knüpfer remained in Utrecht. In 1637 he joined the Guild of Saint Luke, married, and received an important royal commission for three battle scenes, now lost. He painted a few genre scenes and portraits but concentrated primarily on small-scale history paintings."
2610,"KOBELL, Franz","(b. 1749, Mannheim, d. 1822, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kobell/franz/biograph.html,"
Franz Innocenz Josef Kobell was a German painter, draughtsman and etcher, part of the German branch of the Kobell family of painters. He lived in Rome from 1779 to 1784 and became influenced by the heroic, classical landscapes of Claude and Poussin; thereafter, he lived and worked in Munich. He rarely dated his works and produced few oil paintings, preferring instead to execute watercolour sketches and ink drawings of classically composed landscapes.

Austrian painter, active mainly in Rome, where he settled in 1795. He was influenced by Carstens and worked with the Nazarenes on the decorations of the Casino Massimo (1825-29) in Rome, choosing Dante's Inferno for his subject, but is now best known for his landscapes. They were directly descended from the heroic and ideal landscape of Poussin, but have a distinctive Romantic flavour, particularly in his paintings of mountains.

2618,"KOEDIJCK, Isaack","(b. ca. 1617, Amsterdam, d. ca. 1668, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/koedijck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, merchant and naval officer. He lived in both Leiden, where he was married in 1647, and Amsterdam, where he was a friend of the painter Karel Slabbert (c. 1618-54). Koedijk seems to have had financial problems in both cities. In 1651 he travelled with the Dutch India Company to Batavia and Agra, where he was to serve as court painter to the great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Koedijk was employed as a merchant in Surat and Ahmadabad by the Batavian government and the Dutch East India Company until 1659, when he returned to the Netherlands as commander of the fleet.

Dutch painter, one of the most important landscape painters of his generation. He received his first lessons from his father, Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek (1778-1851), and also studied at the Tekenacademie in Middelburg. Subsequently he became a pupil at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie under Jean Augustin Daiwaille (1786-1850). He first participated in an exhibition in 1820. Between 1826 and 1834 he travelled constantly, visiting the Harz Mountains, the Rhine and the Ruhr. His first great success came in 1829 when he won the gold medal of the Amsterdam society Felix Meritis with Landscape with a Rainstorm Threatening (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). The painting is notable for its accurate and sober study of nature; it marked Koekkoek's commitment to a style of landscape divorced both from the predominantly topographical approach of the 18th century and from the flat and decorative manner of contemporary mural painting."
2620,"KOERBECKE, Johann","(b. ca. 1420, Oelsfeld, d. 1490, Münster)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/koerbeck/biograph.html,"

Kokorinov has been house architect of the Razumovsky family and Ivan Shuvalov, the first President of the Academy. Kokorinov's surviving architectural legacy, once believed to be substantial, has been reduced by recent research to only two buildings, the Imperial Academy of Arts and Kirill Razumovsky palace in St. Petersburg. The Academy was designed by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe based on an earlier proposal by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), while Kokorinov managed the construction in its early phases (1764-72).

German painter. He is first documented in Rome between 1610 and 1614, but his obvious knowledge of the work of Hans Rottenhammer the Elder suggests that he lived in Augsburg before travelling to Italy. He must have visited Venice, where it is documented that he made a miniature copy (untraced) of Veronese's Marriage at Cana (1563; Paris, Louvre). In Rome he could have met Adam Elsheimer, who died in 1610 and whose influence is significant in König's work. He also encountered the landscapes of Paul Bril and the early paintings of Carlo Saraceni. In 1614 he returned to Augsburg, where he married and became a master in the guild of painters in 1622."

Philips Koninck (or de Koninck), Dutch painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He studied with his brother Jacob (1614/15-after 1690) in Rotterdam, and Houbraken says he was also a pupil of Rembrandt in Amsterdam, where he settled in 1641. Although he painted various subjects (the poet Vondel praised his portraits and history pictures) his fame now rests on his landscapes. He specialized in extensive views, and his work has a majesty and power that rivals the similar scenes of Ruisdael; the National Gallery in London has four outstanding examples. Like many Dutch painters he had a second occupation; he ran a prosperous shipping firm and evidently painted little in the last decade of his life. His wealth enabled him to collect drawings. He was a prolific draughtsman himself and his sketchy penmanship can be deceptively close to Rembrandt's.



"
2628,"KONINCK, Salomon","(b. 1609, Amsterdam, d. 1656, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/koninck/salomon/biograph.html,"
Salomon Koninck (1609-56), the cousin of Philips and Jacob, was also a painter. He was a follower of Rembrandt, imitating him in pictures of hermits, old men, and philosophers in their studies, as well as in religious scenes, and exaggerating the master's early predilection for rich exotic costumes, emphatic gestures, and dramatic contrasts of light and shadow. His work is fairly rare; there are examples in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the Mauritshuis, The Hague.

His oniy certain work is the signed polyptych in Niederwildungen Parish Church, obscurely dated, but probably 1404. This shows the influence of the soft style, and, more precisely, contemporary Franco-Burgundian work. Other works attributed to him are in churches in Soest and Dortmund.

2636,"KRAFFT, Johann Peter","(b. 1780, Hanau - d. 1856, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/krafft/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, teacher and curator of German birth. From the age of ten, Krafft studied at the Hanau Akademie while at the same time continuing his school education in Hanau. In 1799 he went to Vienna with his sister and studied at the Akademie for three years with the history and portrait painter Heinrich Füger. At this time Krafft painted mythological subjects, made copies from older works and produced several self-portraits that already reveal his capacities in this genre, for example. The dream-like atmosphere of total absorption, which Krafft often achieved through his use of the techniques of early German painting, constitutes one of the most striking aspects of his portraits from the turn of the century. From 1802 to 1804 he was in Paris, where he studied with Jacques-Louis David and François Gérard. The work of these two, together with that of Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Antoine-Jean Gros, was to influence Krafft's later work when he returned to Vienna. David's realist tendencies in painting had a fundamental effect on Krafft's artistic output, and it was through Krafft that this realism contributed to a development towards Biedermeier art in Vienna."
2637,"KRAFFT, Per the Elder","(b. 1724, Arboga, d. 1793, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/krafft_p/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter. He was a pupil of the court painter Johan Henrik Scheffel (1690-1781) until 1747 and then of Carl Gustaf Pilo in Copenhagen. Through Pilo he met Otto Thott, the Danish Minister of Finance, who was to be important for his career. Krafft executed several portraits for him (e.g. Count Otto Thott, 1752; Hillerod, Frederiksborg Slot), and in 1755 he was sent by Thott to Paris with a commission to copy 200 paintings after such artists as Hyacinthe Rigaud, Nicolas de Largillierre and Pierre Mignard. He was taught there by Alexander Roslin but was more attracted to the bourgeois and intimate milieu of Chardin's and Greuze's paintings."

German sculptor, active in Nuremberg. He was a virtuoso stone carver and his most celebrated work, the tabernacle in St Lawrence, Nuremberg (1493-96). is a gigantic stone imitation (c.18 m high) of a subtle piece of goldsmith's work. The richly decorated structure houses a multitude of human figures, animals, amphibia, etc. One of the supporting figures at the base is supposed to be a selfportrait of Kraft. Other examples of his work can be seen in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg.

From 1874 he studied at the Konstakademi in Stockholm, where he soon became a friend of Richard Bergh and Karl Nordström, both of whom were later prominent exponents of the more advanced Swedish painting of the 1880s and 1890s. After being forced to interrupt his studies because of illness, Kreuger trained from 1878 at the art school of Edvard Perseus (1841-90) in Stockholm before he travelled to Paris, where he stayed for the most part until 1887. He made his début at the Paris Salon in 1882, and he also resided in the artists' colony in Grèz-sur-Loing. During this period he painted such works as Old Country House (1887; Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) with a free brushwork and sense of light that owed much to Jules Bastien-Lepage."

2647,"KRÜGER, Franz","(b. 1797, Grossbadegast bei Köthen, d. 1857, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kruger/biograph.html,"
German painter. He first trained under the printmaker Carl Wilhelm Kolbe, who instilled in him the qualities of precise observation and solid workmanship. Krüger was accepted into the Berlin Akademie in 1812, but he also continued to train independently, carrying out studies of horses. He soon developed a gift for finding themes that appealed to Prussian society and that reflected it attractively but truthfully; thus he favoured hunting and stable scenes. The wars against Napoleon, however, inspired him to paint military subjects, and in 1818 he gained public recognition with such paintings as March of the Prussian Cavalry (1820; Doorn, Huis Doorn), which shows the return to Berlin of the Prussian troops under Field Marshal Gneisenau in 1815."

During his apprenticeship Krumper worked on the new wings of the Residenz built round the Grottenhof, and probably also on the over life-size terracotta figures made in Gerhard's workshop for the Michaelskirche, Munich."
2650,"KUCHARSKI, Aleksander","(b. 1741, Warszawa, d. 1819, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kucharsk/biograph.html,"
Polish painter, active in France. After training in Warsaw, he studied under Joseph-Marie Vien and Carle van Loo at the Académie Royale in Paris, 1760-69. He enjoyed the patronage of Stanislaw II Poniatowski, King of Poland, who wanted him to train as a historical painter and withdrew his support when Kucharski instead specialized in portraiture. He generally painted half-lengths in oval frames, in oil, pastel or gouache or in miniature; his compositions were simple: figures set against neutral backgrounds, straightforward in gesture and pose, strongly characterized and yet decorative. He portrayed mainly young French aristocrats and visiting Polish nobles. Among his finest portraits is that of Louise de Polastron (1789; Versailles, Château), displaying animated and expressive features, grace and elegance in pose and costume."

Bohemian painter. Kupecky the son of Czech parents who sought refuge in Hungary from religious persecution, was born in Bazin (near Bratislava) and throughout his life declared himself a Bohemus, a Czech. According to the sources he began his studies with the Swiss painter Benedikt Klaus, who was active in both Vienna and Hungary. At the age of twenty Kupecky went on a long Italian study trip. He returned to Vienna in 1709, after twenty-two years spent in Venice and Rome. We know very little of his Italian activity as well as his early works and his setting in Vienna."
2655,"KYHN, Vilhelm","(b. 1819, København, d. 1903, Frederiksberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/k/kyhn/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, etcher and draughtsman. He first studied etching, and in 1836 entered the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster in Copenhagen, where he studied until 1843. His work mainly consists of landscape paintings and etchings. He travelled extensively within Denmark, being especially fond of the green and undulating countryside of Zealand and mid-Jutland with its calm lakes and inlets. September at the Mill of Rye, Lake Birk (1886; Copenhagen, Hirschsprungske Samling) has a solitary angler in a boat in the foreground, but as a rule Kyhn's landscapes are without figures. Influenced by the current of National Romanticism associated with an earlier generation (Johan Thomas Lundbye, Peter Christian Skovgaard), Kyhn wanted his subject-matter to be unmistakably Danish, and meticulously chose time, place and weather to evoke the requisite moods and associations. Stillness and lyricism are among Kyhn's finest qualities, but his stubbornly academic outlook may have hampered a broader painterly talent. He founded the 'Cavern Academy' in his garden studio, a forerunner of the 'Free Art Schools', where the strongest emphasis was placed on painting and drawing from life. Anna Ancher was one of his pupils in the drawing classes he held for women.

In 1626 he was back in Troyes, and the following year he received commissions for pictures for the Troyes Cathedral, which no longer survive. In 1634 he moved to Paris, where he executed in 1636 a 'May' for Notre Dame, which was an annual commission for the cathedral. Three years later he again returned to Troyes, where he seems to have spent most of the rest of his career."

In December 1879 he was awarded a gold medal and a travelling scholarship along with a letter of introduction from Frederic Leighton to Jean-Léon Gérôme, under whom he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. While there he was influenced by the rustic naturalist painters of the Salon and by Whistler. Such early works as Study in a Boatbuilding Yard on the French Coast (private collection) echo the work of Jean-Charles Cazin and Jules Bastien-Lepage."

He was born in St Quentin and went to Paris as a young man; after visits to London and other places he settled in Paris 1724-84. He soon found that the vogue for pastel portraits started by Rosalba Carriera in 1719/20 was still capable of exploitation and he devoted the rest of his life to it. His portraits are characterized by an extreme vivacity of handling - sometimes rather vulgar - and a firm grasp of character. As a very old man the study of politics drove him crazy, and he retired to St Quentin, where the largest and best collection of his works is to be found: it includes many studies and sketches which are sometimes superior to the finished portraits.

From 1762 to 1769 Lafrensen the Younger studied in Paris, where French Rococo painting suited his temperament and was to be most important for his future development. His choice of realistic themes rather than those from the antique world led to his becoming a favourite of the public, though not of the academicians. On his return to Stockholm he obtained a commission from Crown Prince Gustav (later Gustav III) to paint 12 miniature portraits (1770; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum), in connection with which he was appointed Royal Court Miniature Painter.

French painter and draughtsman. He was the son of a Dijon tailor who taught him his own craft. In 1739 he moved to Paris to study painting, possibly with Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni. He is said to have travelled to England early in his career. In September 1745 he was made a member of the Académie de St Luc in Paris, and in 1747 he settled in Rome. During his 14 years in the city - interrupted only by a trip to Naples - he was in contact with such French artists as the painters Etienne Parrocel, Claude-Joseph Vernet (whose Italianate manner may have influenced Lallemand) and Jean Barbault, and the architect Charles de Wailly. (He later worked with de Wailly after his return to France, painting views of the château of Montmusard (c. 1770; Dijon, Musée des Beaux-Arts) from the architect's drawings.) He frequented the Académie de France at a time when the architectural draughtsmen Charles-Michel-Ange Challes, Nicolas-Henri Jardin and Louis-Joseph Le Lorrain were there. In 1755 he taught Robert Adam landscape drawing.

At about this time he executed four large paintings of antique architecture (St Petersburg, Hermitage) for the Anitchkov Palace in St Petersburg. In 1758 he painted the Finding of Moses (Rome, Pinacoteca Vaticana), intended to decorate the papal bedchamber in the Palazzo Quirinal. Four large vedute in the Villa Lante at Bagnaia may also have been painted in Rome."

His most important surviving work, The Échevins of Paris in the Musée Carnavalet, Paris, is a rare example of a group portrait from the period.

2680,"LAMA, Giulia",(1681-1747),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lama/biograph.html,"Italian painter. She was a follower of Piazzetta, who made a drawing of her c. 1720 (Lugano, Thyssen Collection). Her style was very close to his, and is known from two altarpieces in Venice (S. Vitale, Sta Maria Formosa), one in the parish church of Malamocco, and one now in Ca' Rezzonico, Venice. Her life and career is poorly documented.



"
2681,"LAMBERT, George","(b. ca. 1700, London, d. 1765, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lambert/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was a pupil of Warner Hassels (active 1680-1710), a portrait painter in Godfrey Kneller's circle, but Lambert's earliest dated painting, Classical Landscape with Two Figures (1723; private collection), already shows the influence of the landscape painter John Wootton. From 1726 he worked in London as a scene painter at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre; he followed the impresario John Rich to Covent Garden Theatre in 1732 and continued to work there until his death."
2682,"LAMBERTI, Niccolò di Piero","(b. 1370, Firenze, d. 1451, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lamberti/niccolo/biograph.html,"
Niccolò di Piero (Pietro) Lamberti (called il Pela), sculptor and architect, member of an Italian family of artists. Both Niccolò di Piero Lamberti and his son Piero di Niccolò Lamberti produced sculpture of average quality, but they were important for exporting the Tuscan style to Venice, where they were active in the late 1410s and 1420s."
2683,"LAMBERTI, Piero di Niccolò","(b. ca. 1393, Firenze, d. 1435, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lamberti/piero/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, son of the sculptor Niccolò di Piero Lamberti. He seems to have been trained in his father's shop; he is first recorded in 1410 for some very minor work - probably polishing stone - on the Linaiuoli niche at Or San Michele. On 2 May 1415 Piero matriculated in the stonemason's guild. Little is known of his work in Florence. A 'Petrus de Florentia' mentioned in the will of Cristoforo Campione in Venice in 1416 is generally believed to refer to Piero di Niccolò, suggesting that he moved to Venice with his father that year. Piero was again in Florence in 1418, when he made the sarcophagus (but not the arch that frames it) for the tomb of Onofrio Strozzi in the sacristy of Santa Trinità, a work that does not demonstrate great accomplishment in figure carving."
2684,"LAMI, Eugène Louis","(b. 1800, Paris, d. 1890, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lami/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He first studied painting with Horace Vernet, who in 1817 sent him to study with Baron Antoine-Jean Gros at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. There he met Theodore Géricault and learned the art of watercolour painting from the English Romantic, Richard Parkes Bonington. Much of Lami's early work was in lithography, which had only recently become a commercially viable medium. Between 1819 and 1821 he produced numerous lithographs depicting the Spanish cavalry, as well as a large series illustrating the uniforms of the French Army."
2685,"LAMOUR, Jean","(b. 1698, Nancy, d. 1771, Nancy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lamour/biograph.html,"
French ironmonger, active in Nancy. His fame rests on a series of commissions in Nancy given by Stanislav I Leszczyñski, King of Poland (reg 1704-09) and from 1736 Grand Duke of Lorraine and Bar. Lamour's greatest works were the wrought-iron gates and railings of the Place Stanislas (1752-56). He also executed the decorative ironwork for the Hôtel de Ville (with a splendid staircase rail), the seminary and the Château de Chanteheux.



"
2686,"LAMPI, Johann Baptist I","(b. 1751, Romeno, d. 1830, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lampi/father/biograph.html,"
Austrian historical and portrait painter, born at Romeno, today in the Italian Province of Trento. After early training with his father, he went to Salzburg (1768-70) to study with his mother's brother Peter Anton Lorenzoni (1721-82), who painted altarpieces. In Salzburg he probably also received instruction in historical and portrait painting from Franz Xaver König (1711-82) and Franz Nikolaus Streicher (1738-1811). Between 1770 and 1773 he studied in Verona under Francesco Lorenzi (1723-87), a pupil of Giambattista Tiepolo. He became a member of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Verona in 1773; during this time he painted several works for churches in the Verona-Trento area and also painted frescoes, for example the ceiling (1772) of the Assunta in Romeno. (In Italy he was called Givanni Battista Lampi.) Influenced at first by the late Baroque style of the Tiepolo school, Lampi gradually began to adopt a classicizing approach, as in the altarpiece Christ on the Cross (1779; Cles, Assunta). However, his work was inclined to be dry and academic, and his only successful religious picture, with its simplified forms and subdued colouring, is the Dead Christ (1779; Cles, Franciscan monastery)."
2687,"LAMPI, Johann Baptist II","(b. 1775, Trento, d. 1837, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lampi/son/biograph.html,"
Austrian portrait painter. He was born at Trento and studied under his father, Johann Baptist Lampi I, and later at the Academy at Vienna. He went with his father for thirteen years to St. Petersburg, and became a member of the Academy at that city as well as of that at Vienna in 1813. He painted many of the most distinguished personages of his time. He died at Vienna.



"
2688,"LAMPSONIUS, Dominicus","(b. 1532, Bruges, d. 1599, Liège)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lampsoni/biograph.html,"
Flemish humanist, poet, and artist. Through his writings, a great deal is known about engravers and printers of the era. In 1572 he published under his own name a series of twenty-three engraved portraits of artists from the Low Countries, which was called Portraits of some Celebrated Artists of the Low Countries (Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies). Lampsonius provided poems in Latin to accompany the individual portraits. This work was previously being prepared by the engraver Hieronymous Cock, who died before it was completed. In 1576, Lampsonius finished his only known extant work of art, a Crucifixion scene."
2689,"LANCERAY, Evgeni Alexandrovich","(b. 1848, Morshansk, d. 1886, Neskuchnoe)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lanceray/biograph.html,"
Evgeni Alexandrovich Lanceray (Eugène Lanseré), Russian sculptor. He was the grandson of Major Paul Lanseré of the Napoleonic army, who was wounded and captured at the Battle of Borodino (1812) and decided to remain in Russia, where he married the daughter of the governor of Vilna."
2690,"LANCRET, Nicolas","(b. 1690, Paris, d. 1743, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lancret/biograph.html,"French painter, he was, with Pater, the principal imitator of Watteau. After failing as a history painter he was influenced by Gillot's theatrical scenes as Watteau had been, and he spent the rest of his life painting fêtes galantes. He is well represented in the Wallace Collection, London.






"
2691,"LANDI, Gaspare","(b. 1756, Piacenza, d. 1830, Piacenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After a brief training in Piacenza, he was sent to Rome in 1781 by his patron, Marchese Giovan Battista Landi. He studied under Pompeo Girolamo Batoni and Domenico Corvi and copied works by Raphael, Michelangelo and 17th-century masters. In Rome he also established a close friendship with Antonio Canova, with whom he shared a preference for studying from live models. Praised for his use of colour, his soft, perfectly measured brushwork and his sense of composition, Landi acquired immediate fame and received numerous commissions for mythological and religious paintings and portraits. Works such as his two large pictures in Piacenza Cathedral, the Funeral of the Virgin (1802) and the Apostles at the Empty Tomb (1804), testify to his attachment to 17th-century imagery."
2692,"LANDINI, Taddeo","(b. ca. 1550, Firenze, d. 1596, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He had a typically Tuscan training and he took up in Rome the model of the Florentine public fountain. He took Guglielmo della Porta's position as papal portraitist: he was the sculptor of the bust of Gregory XIII, now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. His most important works are: The Winter, one of the decorative statues at the bridge of Santa Trinità in Florence; and the statues of four men for the Fontana delle Tartarughe in Rome (1585).



"
2693,"LANDON, Charles Paul","(b. 1760, Nonant-le-Pin, d. 1826, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landon/biograph.html,"
French painter and writer on art. He entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Regnault, where he made a lifelong friendship with Robert Lefèvre. He won the first prize of the Academy in 1792, for study at the French Academy in Rome, where he stayed for five years. After his return from Italy, in the disturbed patronage conditions of the French Revolution, he seems to have abandoned painting and turned to writing, although he began to exhibit in 1795, and continued to do so at various intervals up to 1814. He exhibited three pictures at the Louvre: the Mother's Lesson, the Bath of Paul and Virginia and Daedalus and Icarus."
2694,"LANDSEER, Charles","(b. 1799, London, d. 1879, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landseer/charles/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Sir Edwin Landseer. He trained initially with his father John Landseer (c. 1769-1852), then under Benjamin Robert Haydon, and in 1816 he attended the Royal Academy Schools in London. In 1823 he accompanied Sir Charles Stuart de Rothesay (1779-1845) aboard HMS Wellesley on a voyage to Portugal and then to Brazil, in order to negotiate a commercial treaty with Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil (reg. 1822-1831). Many of the drawings he made on this trip were exhibited in 1828 at the British Institution, and in that year he sent his first painting to the Royal Academy. This was Dorothea, illustrating a scene from Cervantes's Don Quixote."
2695,"LANDSEER, Sir Edwin Henry","(b. 1802, London, d. 1873, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landseer/edwin/biograph.html,"
English painter, sculptor, and engraver of animal subjects. He was the son of an engraver and writer, John Landseer (1769-1852), and was an infant prodigy. His life was one of continuous professional and social success; he was the favourite painter of Queen Victoria (who considered him 'very good looking although rather short') and his friends included Dickens and Thackeray. The qualities in his work that delighted the Victorian public, however, have subsequently caused his reputation to plummet, for although he had great skill in depicting animal anatomy, he tended to humanize his subjects to tell a sentimental story or point a moral. His most familiar works in this vein include The Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1837), Dignity and Impudence (Tate Gallery, London, 1839), and the celebrated The Monarch of the Glen (Guinness plc, Edinburgh, 1850). Other paintings by Landseer have been attacked for their cruelty (he made many visits to the Scottish Highlands and frequently painted scenes of deer-hunting)."
2696,"LANDSEER, Thomas","(b. 1795, London, d. 1880, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/landseer/thomas/biograph.html,"
English printmaker and writer, part of a family of artists. He was the eldest of the fourteen children of engraver John Landseer (c. 1769-1852). Seven of the children survived to adulthood and all became artists; his younger brothers were painters and later Royal Academicians Charles Landseer and Edwin Landseer. Like his siblings, Landseer was taught artistic techniques by his father. He then studied under painter Benjamin Robert Haydon alongside his brother Charles."
2697,"LANE, Fitz Hugh","(b. 1804, Gloucester, Ma., d. 1865, Gloucester, Ma.)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lane/biograph.html,"
American painter and printmaker. A painter of ships and coastal panoramas, Lane is most notable as a leading figure in American luminism. He illuminated his canvases with warm, glowing yellow and pink skies reflected in water. The resulting paintings project a shimmering density that expresses a profound serenity that is akin to transcendentalism. Owl's Head, Penobscot Bay, Maine (1862; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) is a characteristic work.



"
2698,"LANEN, Jasper van der","(b. ca. 1585, Antwerpen, d. after 1626, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lanen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp. He was a pupil of Nicolaas Geerts in 1607 and became master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1615. In 1624 he married Elisabeth Rombouts and the painter Abraham Govaerts was his best man."
2699,"LANEUVILLE, Jean-Louis","(b. 1748, Paris, d. 1826, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laneuvil/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a pupil of his exact contemporary Jacques-Louis David, with whose work his own has frequently been confused. Nothing is known of his early training. David did not take on pupils until 1781, and Laneuville exhibited at the Salon de la Jeunesse in the Place Dauphine, Paris, from 1783 to 1789. He specialized in portraiture and during the French Revolution (1789-95) produced a sequence of paintings of deputies of the Convention, including Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac  (1792-93; Bremen, Kunsthalle), Pierre-François-Joseph Robert and Joseph Delaunay (both exh. Salon 1793; Versailles, Château) and Jules-François Paré (exh. Salon 1795; Paris, Carnavalet). His approach was often similar to that of his master, and the Barère portrait was once attributed to David."
2700,"LANFRANCO, Giovanni","(b. 1582, Parma, d. 1647, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lanfranc/biograph.html,"Italian Baroque painter. He was born near Parma, where he was a pupil of Agostino Carracci, and was also much influenced by the domes by Correggio. He was in Rome in 1612, and about 1616 decorated the ceiling of the Casino Borghese in a manner derived entirely from the Farnese Gallery. He developed Correggio's sotto in sù type of illusionism to an extravagant point, and painted several domes and apses in Roman and Neapolitan churches in this manner. To him Domenichino lost part of the commission for the decoration of Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome, a slight he resented so bitterly that - so the story goes - he weakened part of the scaffolding, hoping that Lanfranco would break his neck. Lanfranco completed the dome with an Assumption, Correggiesque in inspiration, between 1625-27, and such was its success that he was then employed at St Peter's until 1631.

"
2701,"LANGETTI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1635, Genova, d. 1676, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/langetti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His work suggests that Gioacchino Assereto was his principal teacher in Genoa. He must have travelled to Rome at a very early age, and there he studied under Pietro da Cortona. Very little of Cortona's style can be detected in Langetti's extant work, however; its extreme realism and strong contrasts of light and shade are closer to the art of Ribera and his school. It seems likely that Langetti travelled from Rome to Naples, possibly in the middle of the 1650s, to study the art of Ribera, Francesco Fracanzano and Giordano. Giordano may have advised him to go to Venice, where he had himself worked some years previously, and Langetti may have chosen to go in 1656 to avoid the plague that had broken out in Naples."
2702,"LANGHANS, Carl Gotthard","(b. 1732, Landeshut, 1808, Grüneiche)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/langhans/biograph.html,"
German architect, born in Landeshut, Silesia (now Kamienna Góra in Poland). He was not educated as an architect. He studied law from 1753 to 1757 in Halle, and then mathematics and languages, and engaged himself autodidactically with architecture, at which he concentrated primarily on the antique texts of the Roman architecture theorist Vitruvius (and the new version by the classics enthusiast Johann Joachim Winckelmann)."
2703,"LANGLOIS, Jérôme-Martin","(b. 1779, Paris, d. 1838, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/langlois/biograph.html,"
French painter, the son of a miniature painter who did not approve of his son's desire to follow in his occupation. Despite these wishes, Langlois trained with Jacques-Louis David and absorbed his Neoclassical style. He won the Prix de Rome in 1809 and studied in Rome for most of the 1810's. He also exhibited regularly at the Salon beginning in 1805, where he won second prize in 1817 and first prize in 1819. Langlois visited Brussels in 1824 to paint a picture of David. He was admitted to the Académie des Beaux-Arts shortly before his own death.



"
2704,"LANGREN, Hendrik Floris van",(c. 1574-1648),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/langren/biograph.html,"
Dutch cartographer, part of a family of cartographers. The name Van Langren is well known in the annals of cartography. Several members of this family were known as globe-makers, cartographers, mathematicians, and astronomers. The founder of the family, Jacobus Florentius van Langren, was a native of Utrecht; later he moved to Amsterdam where he became a ""freeman"" of the city and where his sons, Arnoldus Florentius van Langren and Henricus Florentius (Hendrik Floris) van Langren, were born. Possibly he was the son of a certain Floris van Langren. Right through the whole family the name Florentius remained in memory of this ancestor.



"
2705,"LANINO, Bernardino","(b. ca. 1512, Vercelli, d. after 1581)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lanino/bernardi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. In 1528 Lanino was apprenticed to Baldassarre de Cadighis of Abbiategrasso in Vercelli, but from 1530 he was associated with Gaudenzio Ferrari, then the most important painter in Vercelli. Lomazzo claimed that Lanino was Gaudenzio's pupil. By 18 November 1533 he was already a master painter. His early works, such as the Virgin and Child with Saints (Turin, Galleria Sabauda), painted for S Eusebio, Ternengo, show how he had assimilated Gaudenzio's delicate effects, and interpreted them in soft, misty brushstrokes. After Gaudenzio moved to Lombardy (c. 1534) and later established himself in Milan (c. 1539-46), Lanino became the most active painter in the region; from this period date the Virgin and Child with Saints (1539), painted for SS Pietro e Paolo, Borgosesia (in situ), and Virgin and Child with Saints (1543; London, National Gallery), painted for Francesco Strata's chapel in S Paolo, Vercelli. Other altarpieces of this date include the Assumption of the Virgin (signed and dated 1543; Biella, S Sebastiano) and frescoes of scenes from the Life of the Virgin in Novara Cathedral (1546-53). "
2706,"LANINO, Girolamo","(b. ca. 1555, Vercelli, d. 1589, Vercelli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lanino/girolamo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, one of the three sons of Bernardino Lanino. In August 1580 Girolamo worked with his father to draw and then paint a tabernacle for the Church of Madonna di Campagna (untraced). In 1586 he painted a panel depicting the Virgin with the Child, Apollonia and a devotee (formerly in the chapel of the castle of Parella, now lost). The workshop of Girolamo and his brother Pietro Francesco executed the Nativity for the Sacro Monte di Pietà, Novara."
2707,"LAPINI, Cesare","(b. 1848, Firenze, d. after 1893, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lapini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, mainly active in Florence. He specialized in marble groups of allegorical, genre and all'antica sculpture for tourists, mainly from England and America. His workshop, the Galleria Lapini, was still operating in 1900."

French painter. Aged 15, Lapito entered the atelier of Louis-Etienne Watelet (1780-1866), before continuing his training under François-Joseph Heim.  Like many of his contemporaries, he had a 'Wanderjahr' in Italy in 1826, after which he became an indefatigable traveller. He visited Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Italy and Corsica, as well as rural France, painting numerous watercolour views and oil sketches on which his larger oil paintings were based."
2709,"LAPORTE, George Henry","(b. 1799, Hannover, d. 1873, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laporte/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in England. He was a sporting painter whose work includes depictions of all aspects of country life: hunting, racing, shooting and animal still-lives. He was the son and pupil of the distinguished watercolourist John Laporte (1761-1839). He was a founder member of the Royal Society of British Artists, where he exhibited regularly. Many of his paintings were engraved for The Sporting Magazine and other journals. Laporte enjoyed a wide and prosperous patronage, and was appointed Animal Painter to the Duke of Cumberland and the King of Hanover."
2710,"LARCIANI, Giovanni di Lorenzo","(b. 1484, Firenze, d. 1527, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/larciani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Florence, known earlier as the Master of the Kress Landscapes. The identity of this master has only recently been established in the mid-1990s as the Florentine Giovanni di Lorenzo Larciani. The artist's oeuvre had been reconstructed around a set of three spalliere panels from the Kress collection and now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. It has been suggested that Larciani had been an assistant in Francesco Granacci's workshop at the beginning of his career."
2711,"LARGILLIÈRE, Nicolas de","(b. 1656, Paris, d. 1746, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/largilli/biograph.html,"Nicolas de Largillière (Largillierre) was born in Paris but passed his youth in Antwerp and, from c. 1674, spent some years in England as Lely's assistant. He was thus almost a Flemish painter when he returned to Paris in 1682. He became a member of the Academy in 1686 and ultimately its Director. His principal rival was Rigaud, but Largillière specialized in portraits of the wealthy middle classes, leaving the aristocrats to Rigaud. There are typical examples in London (National Gallery and Wallace Collection), New York (Metropolitan Museum), and Paris (Louvre). The S. Geneviève (Paris, S. Étienne) is the only survivor of the large ex-voto type of picture that he painted for the Corporations. He also painted a few pictures of still-life.

Italian sculptor of Greek birth or descent (known also as Pyrgoteles). He adopted the name of a celebrated Greek gem cutter who served Alexander the Great. He was active in Venice, Padua, Verona and possibly Ferrara and is first mentioned in an epigram of 1496 by the humanist Giambattista Guarino, who praised his Venus 'flagillifera' (destroyed). Pomponius Gauricus also praised the same work in De sculptura (1504).

Italian engraver, active mainly in Florence. He started as a painter at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Venice. He quickly placed more emphasis on printmaking, especially after moving to Florence in 1778. He established his reputation with two large series of etchings in 1787 and 1789. Lasinio also taught engraving at the Accademia in Florence, becoming a Professor in 1800."

Pierre Lassurance (also Cailleteau), French architect, part of a family of architects. Several members of the family held important posts as architects during the 17th century and early 18th. The most prominent of these was Pierre Lassurance I; one of his sons, Jean Lassurance (1695-1755), worked almost exclusively for Mme de Pompadour, while another, Pierre Lassurance II (no dates), became contrôleur of the châteaux of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Monceaux."
2717,"LASTMAN, Pieter Pietersz.","(b. 1583, Amsterdam, d. 1633, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lastman/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter active in Amsterdam and specialized in religious, historical, and mythological scenes. He went to Italy (c. 1604) and was influenced by Caravaggio - which makes him akin to the Utrecht School - and by Elsheimer. His ""forte"" was small figures in exotic and brightly-coloured costumes. He was back in Amsterdam by 1607. His real importance lies in the fact that Jan Lievens was his pupil in 1617 and Rembrandt in 1624/15.

His oeuvre includes portraits and also landscapes, for example two engravings of Roman ruins (1768) after Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, made for Jean-Georges Wille. As a book illustrator, de Launay contributed to some of the most famous books of the period, including the Métamorphoses d'Ovide (Paris, 1767-71); but he was best known for the amorous scenes that he engraved after such artists as Pierre-Antoine Baudouin, Niclas Lafrensen, Sigmund Freudenberger, Jean-Baptiste Le Prince and, most particularly, Jean-Honoré Fragonard."

Laurana was Dalmatian by birth (at La Vrana, near Zadar) but Venetian by nationality although he worked much in Sicily and France. He is first recorded as working on the Triumphal Arch in Naples (1453-58), but it is difficult to know what he did. He was in France 1461-66 and in Palermo in 1467, returning to France in 1477 for six years.  He must have gone back to France since he died there in 1502."

2722,"LAURENS, Jean-Paul","(b. 1838, Fourquevaux, d. 1921, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laurens/biograph.html,"
French painter, illustrator and teacher. At an early age he took lessons from a Piedmont painter, Pedoya, who had come to Fourquevaux to decorate the village church. Pedoya was a harsh teacher, and Laurens moved to the nearby École des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse. There he studied under Jean-Blaise Villemsens (1806-1859), the professor of sculpture, who took a great interest in him. In 1858 he won the Prix de la Ville de Toulouse, which paid for him to complete his studies in Paris. There he was a pupil first of Alexandre Bida (1823-1895) and then of Léon Cogniet. After a single unsuccessful attempt to win the Prix de Rome, he made his début at the Salon in 1863 with the Death of Cato (1863; Toulouse, Musée des Augustins), which already revealed his fascination for historical subjects."
2723,"LAURETI, Tommaso","(b. ca. 1530, Palermo, d. 1602, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laureti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, designer and engineer. A pupil of Sebastiano del Piombo, he spent his formative years in Bologna in the circle of Ignazio Danti. He was working there between 1563, if not earlier, and 1582, though he was recorded as working in 1579 for Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. He was closely involved in redesigning the Piazza Nettuno in Bologna, providing the designs and the hydraulic engineering for fountains, one of which - the Fountain of Neptune (1566) - was adorned with bronze sculptures by Giambologna, while the Fonte Vecchia (1565) was undertaken by Laureti in collaboration with Giacomo della Porta.


"
2724,"LAURI, Filippo","(b. 1623, Roma, d. 1694, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lauri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He studied first with his father, Balthasar Lauwers (1578-1645), a Flemish landscape painter whose name was Italianized as Lauri, and then with his elder brother, Francesco Lauri (1612-37), and with his brother-in-law, Angelo Caroselli. At least until the death of Caroselli (1652) he worked as a copyist. Francesco had been a pupil of Andrea Sacchi, and Filippo, who was thus trained in a classical tradition, developed an elegant style, indebted to 17th-century Bolognese painters, particularly Domenichino and Francesco Albani. In 1654 Lauri became a member of the Accademia di S Luca, Rome, of which he later became Principe (1684-85). He painted some fresco decorations, but specialised mainly in cabinet pictures of religious or mythological subjects.



"
2725,"LAURI, Pietro",(documented 1634-1669 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lauri_p/biograph.html,"
Pietro Lauri (also called Pietro Laurier) was a French painter, active mainly in Bologna. He lived most of his life in Bologna, where he was brought up in the school of Guido Reni. He painted several pictures for the churches at Bologna: a picture of the Virgin presenting the Infant Jesus to St. Felix for the Cappuccini; and a St. Anthony of Padua in La Madonna della Libertà.



"
2726,"LAUTENSACK, Hanns","(b. ca. 1520, Bamberg, d. ca. 1565, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lautensa/biograph.html,"
German printmaker. Often erroneously referred to as Hans Sebald Lautensack, he was the son of Paul Lautensack (1478-1558), a painter and organist from Bamberg. In 1527, the family moved to Nuremberg where he probably studied with a goldsmith. He then began creating topographical views of the city and landscapes that were influenced by the Danube School, in particular by Albrecht Altdorfer's works. Lautensack also produced portraits of Nuremberg burghers until 1554, when Emperor Ferdinand I summoned him to reproduce his classical coin collection. In portraits of Nuremberg burghers from 1552 and 1553, Lautensack developed a trademark composition that related his sitter to the outdoors by showing a view through a window to a distant landscape."
2727,LAUTIZIO DI MEO DE ROTELLI,(active 1511-1527),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lautizio/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith. Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine sculptor and goldsmith, furnished unprecedented biographical and technical accounts of the creation of seal matrices in his autobiography and a treatise entitled De' Suggelli Cardinaleschi (On Cardinals' Seals). He mentions one Lautizio de' Meo di Rotelli, a Perugian goldsmith also known as Lautizio da Perugia, who was allegedly unique in the world in practicing seal engraving professionally in Rome. Over the last 150 years, several extant matrices, impressions, and casts of cardinals' seals from the first quarter of the Cinquecento have been assigned to the Perugian, despite the fact that archival and stylistic evidences does not always support these attributions."
2728,"LAVES, Georg Ludwig Friedrich","(b. 1788, Uslar, d. 1864, Hannover)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laves/biograph.html,"
German architect, civil engineer and urban planner. He lived and worked primarily in the city of Hanover. He was appointed Oberhofbaudirektor, ""court master builder"", in 1852. As the leading architect of the Kingdom of Hanover for a career spanning 50 years, he had great influence on the urban development of this city. Alongside Karl Friedrich Schinkel in Berlin and Leo von Klenze in Munich, Laves was one of the most accomplished Neoclassical style architects of Germany."
2729,"LAVIRON, Pierre","(b. 1605, Antwerpen, d. 1685)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/laviron/biograph.html,"
French sculptor during the reign of King Louis XIV. Laviron was trained and worked in the French Academic system. He won the prize of the Academy in 1676 and 1578, but was never made Academician. He stayed in Rome from 1678 to 1682 at the Académie de France."
2730,"LAWRENCE, Sir Thomas","(b. 1769, Bristol, d. 1830, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lawrence/biograph.html,"

2731,"LAWSON, Ernst","(b. 1873, Halifax, Nova Scotia, d. 1939, Miami Beach)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lawson/biograph.html,"
Canadian painter, resident in the US. In 1889-91 he worked as a graphic designer in Mexico. In 1891 he studied at the Art Students League in New York under Twachtman and Weir and attended the summer courses in Cos Cob. In 1893 he moved to Paris and studied in the Académie Julian. His Impressionist leanings were confirmed when he met Sisley and Moret. In 1894 he exhibited for the first time at the Paris Salon."
2732,"LAZZARINI, Gregorio","(b. 1655, Venezia, d. 1730, Villabona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lazzarin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Son of a barber and brother of the painter Elisabetta Lazzarini (1662-1729), he was an accomplished painter of portraits, mythological and historical subjects. He was much patronized by the Venetian nobility, including the Labia, for whom he worked throughout the 1680s, and the Donà. He was trained first by the Genoese Francesco Rosa (d 1687), then by Girolamo Forabosco and, finally, in the academy of Pietro della Vecchia. He is documented as working in Venice from 1687 to 1715, after which he retired to Villabona."
2733,"LE BRETON, Gilles","(b. ca. 1500, Paris, d. ca. 1552, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_breto/biograph.html,"
French architect. He played a crucial role in the works initiated by Francis I at Fontainebleau from 1527, although the exact nature of his duties is difficult to determine. It is possible that he was the architect responsible for the design as well as the execution of the first phase of works, even though the building accounts imply only that he was active as a master mason; some scholars have suggested instead that the designs for certain parts with which Le Breton's name is associated may have been provided by the Italian Rosso Fiorentino."
2734,"LE BRUN, Charles","(b. 1619, Paris, d. 1690, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_brun/biograph.html,"
French painter and art theorist, the dominant artist of Louis XIV's reign. His father, the sculptor Nicolas Le Brun the Elder, sent him at a very young age to study under François Perrier, and later under Simon Vouet. Le Brun copied various paintings at Fontainebleau and from the age of 15, painted several compositions for Cardinal Richelieu; Poussin, who was then in Paris, found them interesting.

Le Brun's output was prolific. When he was not painting, he produced etchings, drawings based on doctrines, and wax models. Chancellor Séguier, who was his faithful protector, paid him a salary so that in 1642 he could go to Italy, and entrusted him to Poussin, who was returning to Rome. Le Brun worked under Poussin, becoming a convert to the latter's theories of art.

"
2735,"LE CLERC, Sébastien I","(b. 1637, Metz, d. 1714, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_clerc/biograph.html,"
Sébastien Le Clerc I (also Leclerc), printmaker, draughtsman and military engineer, part of a French family of artists. Laurent Le Clerc (1590-1695) was a goldsmith from Metz. The most prominent members of the Leclerc family were his son Sébastien Leclerc I and Sébastien's son Sébastien Le Clerc II. Another son of Sébastien Le Clerc, Louis-Auguste Le Clerc (1699-1771), was a sculptor and pupil of Antoine Coysevox; from 1735 he worked in Denmark, becoming professor at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skonne Kunster in Copenhagen. His son and pupil Jacques-Sébastien Le Clerc (1734-1785) became a painter, producing small-scale amorous scenes; from 1778 he taught at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris."
2736,"LE DUC, Gabriel","(b. ca. 1623, Paris, d. 1696, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_duc/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the son of Gabriel Le Duc (d. 1654), Master Mason of Paris. He travelled in 1647 to Italy (a journey very much the fashion in Paris at the time), where he took notes on ancient and modern monuments, including Michelangelo's Porta Pia in Rome."
2737,"LE FORT DU PLESSY, Claude","(active 1707, Wien, d. 1757, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_fort/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer, active in Austria. He was involved in designing and furnishing the interior of Prince Eugene of Savoy's Stadtpalais in Vienna in 1707 and was mentioned in 1714 as Governor of the Arsenal. Two years later he was recorded in connection with work on a state bed for Empress Maria-Theresa. Between 1721 and 1728 he played a leading part in designing the interior of the imperial picture gallery in the upper floors of the Stallburg in the Hofburg.



"

2739,"LE HONGRE, Étienne","(b. 1628, Paris, d. 1690, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_hongr/biograph.html,"
French sculptor during the reign of Louis XIV. He was son of a master carpenter, and was apprenticed to Jacques Sarazin. As a pensioner of the king, he studied in Rome from 1653 to 1659. He was accredited (agréé) at the Royal Academy in 1653, and made 'Académicien' in 1667 with a marble relief of St Magdalene."
2740,"LE LORRAIN, Louis-Joseph","(b. 1715, Paris, 1759, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_lorr/biograph.html,"
French painter, furniture designer, architect and engraver. He studied with Jacques Dumont and won the Grand Prix de Peinture in 1739. He remained for eight years in Rome, where his architectural designs for the temporary centrepiece of the annual Chinea festival (1745, 1746 and 1747) are early examples of Neo-classicism, displaying a simple architectonic use of the orders that indicates his association with Giovanni Battista Piranesi in the circle of students of the Académie de France in Rome, who were highly influential in French architecture from the 1760s onwards."
2741,"LE LORRAIN, Robert","(b. 1666, Paris, d. 1743, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_lorra/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. His family were functionaries associated with Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's Minister of Finance, and were ruined by his disgrace. He trained first with the painter Pierre Mosnier, and in 1684 he entered the studio of François Girardon, where he worked under his orders on the execution of the tomb of Cardinal Richelieu (marble, c. 1683-89; Paris, Church of the Sorbonne). He later returned to help Girardon as the principal executant of Girardon's memorial to his wife, the flower painter Catherine Duchemin (marble, c. 1703-07; Paris, Ste Marguerite)."
2742,"LE MUET, Pierre","(b. 1591, Dijon, d. 1669, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_muet/biograph.html,"
French architect and theoretician. His most important work was Manière de bastir pour toutes sortes de personnes (Manner of Building for All Sorts of People, 1623), which probably drew on Serlio's then unpublished sixth book of Architettura, and Du Cerceau's Trois Livres d'Architecture, especially the first book (1559). Le Muet's book contains designs for urban dwellings for sites ranging from very small to quite large, was reprinted three times, came out in an English translation in 1670, and was superseded in 1720 by a collection of designs entitled Architecture moderne ou l'art de bien bastir pour toutes sortes de personnes."

French painters, brothers (Antoine, d. 1648, Louis, d. 1648, Mathieu, c. 1607-1677), who were born at Laon but had all moved to Paris by 1630. The traditional birth-dates for Antoine and Louis are 1588 and 1593, respectively, but it is now thought that they were born shortly before and shortly after 1600, so that all three brothers were of much the same generation."
2744,"LE NÔTRE, André","(b. 1613, Paris, d. 1700, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_notre/biograph.html,"
French architect, landscape architect and garden designer. He was the grandson of Pierre Le Nôtre, gardener in the service of Catherine de' Medici. He succeeded his father, Jean Le Nôtre, as 'premier jardinier du Roi au grand jardin des Tuileries' in 1637 under Louis XIII."
2745,"LE PAUTRE, Antoine","(b. 1621, Paris, d. 1679, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_pautr/antoine/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer, part of a family of artists, brother of Jean Le Pautre. He is said to have studied design and etching with his older brother Jean, and probably learnt the rudiments of architecture from Étienne Martellange. A document of 1643 refers to him as mason and architect, and in 1644 he was called Architecte des Bâtiments du Roi, perhaps indicating that he had worked at a royal building site. His earliest patrons were the French Jansenists, to whom he became known through his father (or another relative), who had worked in 1639 in the Parisian hôtel of the Jansenist Anne de Rohan. In 1646 Le Pautre began the chapel of Port-Royal de Paris (completed 1648), the first Jansenist church, and the Hôtel de Fontenay-Mareuil, Paris (completed 1647; destroyed), built for the French ambassador to Rome, whose mother was related to the Jansenist Arnauld family."
2746,"LE PAUTRE, Jean","(b. 1618, Paris, d. 1682, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_pautr/jean/biograph.html,"
Designer and engraver, part of a French family of artists. Adrien Le Pautre was a master joiner. Of his three notable sons Jean Le Pautre was a designer and printmaker, whose published works, sold singly or in sets, were an important conduit for disseminating French architectural taste throughout Europe in the 17th century."
2747,"LE PAUTRE, Pierre II","(b. ca. 1659, Paris, d. 1744, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_pautr/pierre2/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, part of a French family of artists. Adrien Le Pautre was a master joiner. Of his three notable sons Jean Le Pautre (1618-1682) was a designer and printmaker, whose published works, sold singly or in sets, were an important conduit for disseminating French architectural taste throughout Europe in the 17th century. Another son, also called Jean Le Pautre, was active as a mason, but perhaps the most important member of the family was Antoine Le Pautre (1621-1679), an architect whose Baroque style found favour among members of the aristocracy and with King Louis XIV. Pierre I Le Pautre (c. 1648-1716), Pierre II Le Pautre (1659-1744), a sculptor and Jacques Le Pautre (c. 1653-1684), an engraver, were sons of Jean, while Antoine's sons included another Jean Le Pautre (1648-1735), a sculptor, and Claude Le Pautre (b 1649), an architect."
2748,"LE PRINCE, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1734, Metz, d. 1781, Saint-Denis-du-Port)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_princ/biograph.html,"
French painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Born to a family of ornamental sculptors and gilders, he became famous for creating a new kind of genre picture, based on the direct observation of Russian subjects, and also for perfecting aquatint technique. Sometime around 1750 he became a pupil of François Boucher, thanks to the protection of the Maréchal de Belle-Isle (1684-1761), governor of Metz. Boucher's saturated brushwork, highly finished surfaces and incisive drawing had a decisive impact upon the young artist, as did, perhaps, the diversity of his output. He was also inspired by 17th-century Dutch and Flemish genre and landscape painters."
2749,"LE ROUX, Jacques",(died 1510),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_roux/jacques/biograph.html,"
French architect. In 1489 he signed a contract with the abbot of La Trinité, Fécamp, to construct the axial Lady Chapel. In 1496 he replaced Guillaume Pontis (active 1443-1497) as master of the Works at Rouen Cathedral. For the next ten year he was occupied with finishing the south-west tower, the Tour de Beurre, begun by Pontis in 1487. Owing to lack of money and to the cathedral chapter's indecisiveness over the nature of the termination, work progressed slowly and the octagonal crown of the tower was not completed until 1507."
2750,"LE ROUX, Roullant","(active 1508, d. 1527, Rouen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_roux/roullant/biograph.html,"
French architect and sculptor. He was the nephew and pupil of Jacques Le Roux (died 1510), architect, and the pupil of Guillaume Pontits (died 1497), master builder and stonemason. In 1510 he succeeded his uncle as Master of the Works of Rouen Cathedral and immediately undertook the reconstruction of the central portal of the west façade. Its gables and niches harmonize with the older Gothic work and the design of the inner west wall is one of the masterpieces of late Flamboyant."

2753,"LE TAVERNIER, Jean",(active 1434-1460 in Burgundy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_taver/biograph.html,"
Flemish illuminator. He seems to have specialized in the illustration of chronicles and similar texts and to have undertaken commissions principally for the Burgundian ducal court. In 1434 Le Tavernier became a Master in Tournai, where he was still working in 1440 when he took on an apprentice. He contributed to the decorations for the 'banquet du faisan' organized in Lille in 1454 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, for which Le Tavernier's payment was higher than average. In the same year he was resident in Oudenaarde and received payment from Philip the Good for 230 grisailles and 2 full-colour miniatures in a Book of Hours belonging to the Duke, and for illuminating a 'Livre de Godeffroy de Buillon'. In 1460 Le Tavernier received a payment for 'certaines histoires de blanc et de noir' (grisailles executed in the first volume of a 'Livre de Charlemaigne') and an advance payment for illustrations to be produced in the second volume of this work."
2754,"LE VAU, Louis","(b. 1612, Paris, d. 1670, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/le_vau/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the son and pupil of the stone mason Louis Le Vau (d. 1661). He began his career in the 1630s, designing row houses and ""hôtels particuliers"" on the Ile Saint-Louis, Paris.

English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet. He is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised. His principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to illustrate birds and animals; making coloured drawings during his journeys, which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books; as a (minor) illustrator of Alfred Tennyson's poems. As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson's poetry."

Jean-Jacques-François Lebarbier (Le Barbier), French painter, illustrator and writer. He began his studies in Rouen and, at 17, won first prize for drawing at the city's Académie. Shortly afterwards he travelled to Paris, entering the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture as a student of Jean-Baptiste-Marie Pierre. In 1767-68 he was in Rome, a fact confirmed by a number of dated and inscribed drawings and paintings, including the pen, ink and wash drawing Landscape Inspired by the Gardens of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli (Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts). He was in Switzerland in 1776, where he spent several years drawing illustrations for Beát Zurlauben's Tableau de la Suisse ou voyage pittoresque fait dans les treize cantons du Corps Helvétique (Paris, 1780-86)."

Czech landscape painter. In 1892-97 he studied at the Prague Academy with Julius Maøák (1832-1899), and then in 1898 in Paris at the Académie Colarossi. In Paris he became acquainted with the colourful tones of Impressionism which nevertheless did not suppress the expressiveness of his paintings. He painted landscapes in the forest of Fontainebleau, in Brittany and Normandy."

He became increasingly interested in art and through Drouin met the landscape painter Victor Delamarre (1811-1868) who advised and taught him. Giving up architecture altogether, he then attended the École Municipale de Peinture et de Dessin in Rouen under Gustave Morin (1809-1886)."

French painter and etcher (also spelt Le Clerc). He was born into a family in the service of Duke Charles III of Lorraine (reg. 1559-1608). He perhaps had his earliest training in the then independent duchy. He is said to have spent more than 20 years in Italy but is first recorded there in 1617, in the house in Rome of the Venetian painter Carlo Saraceni. His earliest known etching, a Death of the Virgin after Saraceni, was published in Rome in 1619. In 1621 he signed the mural Doge Enrico Dandolo Recruiting for the Crusade in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Doge's Palace in Venice. This work had been begun, or at least designed, by Saraceni before his death the previous year. As a reward Leclerc was made a knight of the Order of San Marco.

French painter and lithographer. He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault and Pierre-Antoine Mongin (1761-1827). He exhibited regularly at the Salon between 1804 and 1847 and received a first class medal as a genre painter in 1808. His reputation was based above all on his historical landscapes. Apart from a few contemporary subjects, his subjects were taken from an idealized view of the Middle Ages. He was one of the first landscape painters to turn to medieval history, but unlike most painters of historical landscape he emphasized the setting and tried to raise landscape to the level of history painting. However, he is best known for his ballet designs."

Spanish painter. He is known to have worked in Granada from 1602, and in 1614 he designed a stucco vault decoration for the Alhambra. Archival sources testify to his renown as a painter of decorative fresco grotesques (untraced) and still-lifes. His activity as a still-life painter remains debatable, partly because he has been confused with Blas de Prado. Ledesma's only unanimously accepted autograph painting is Basket of Cherries and Flowers (High Museum of Art, Atlanta), signed in Granada. A highly decorative painting, it shows none of the sophistication of still-lifes by Juan Sánchez Cotán, in Granada from 1603. Two other unsigned and poorly preserved still-lifes of analogous subject-matter have been attributed to Ledesma (private collection). Three very different signed still-lifes depicting sweets, fruits and exotic birds have also been tentatively accepted as autograph (private collections).

2766,"LEDOUX, Claude-Nicolas","(b. 1736, Dormans, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/ledoux/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was a student of Louis François Trouard (1729-1794), and possibly an apprentice of Pierre Contant d'Ivry (1698-1777). He was one of the most fashionable, successful and celebrated Parisian architects of the late 1700s, known for an eclectic and visionary style that he combined with social ideals. Most of his work is characterized by designs that incorporate simplified, powerful geometric forms."
2767,"LEE, Frederick Richard","(b. 1798, Barnstable, 1879, Wellington, South Africa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lee/biograph.html,"
English painter, son of Thomas Lee Snr. and brother of Thomas Lee Jnr. (both well-known architects). Frederick was enrolled as a student in the Royal Academy in 1818. He was elected as ARA in 1834. one of his paintings from this time is Bringing in the Stag (1830; Tate Gallery, London). "
2768,"LEEFDAEL, Willem van",(1632-1668),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leefdael/biograph.html,"
Flemish tapestry weaver, active in Brussels. He was the son of Jan van Leefdael (1603-1668), a tapestry weaver in Brussels, who was dean of the craft in 1644.



"
2769,"LEEMANS, Johannes","(b. 1633, Den Haag, d. 1688, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leemans/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the younger brother of the painter Anthonie Leemans (c. 1630-1671). Both painters are known for still-life paintings of hunting paraphernalia and vanitas pieces. They made a profitable living making trompe-l'oeil paintings of hunting paraphernalia, birdcages, and weaponry."
2770,"LEEMPUT, Remigius van","(b. 1607, Antwerpen, d. 1675, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leemput/biograph.html,"
Flemish (possibly French) painter, copyist, collector and dealer, active in England. In 1635 he was living in the newly developed area of Covent Garden, London; at that time he was closely associated with Anthony van Dyck and presumably assisted in his studio. Through his varied activities, van Leemput became a leading figure in the London art world, and he assembled a major collection of paintings and drawings. He bought extensively when Charles I's collections were sold in 1649-51; his purchases included works attributed to Titian, Giorgione, Correggio and Andrea del Sarto. Later he acquired the great equestrian portrait by van Dyck of Charles I with M. de St Antoine (British Royal Collection), which he apparently attempted to sell in Antwerp but asked too high a price. It was still with him at the Restoration in 1660, when it was recovered from him for Charles II.



"
2771,"LEEN, Willem van","(b. 1753, Dordrecht, d.1825, Delfshaven)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the third child of Jan van Leen and Johanna Koeberg. His father was a painter and owned a jewelry and art store in Dordrecht. After training with his father, Willem van Leen had lessons from other painters of Dordrecht. At the age of twenty he left for Paris, where he studied flower painting for three years. He was one of a number of gifted Dutch artists who worked and studied in Paris in the late eighteenth century. There he was influenced by his friend, the Dutch painter Gerard van Spaendonck."
2772,"LEERMANS, Pieter","(b. ca. 1655, d. ca. 1706, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leermans/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Presumably working in Leiden, Leermans has been identified as the creator of the group portrait of the regents of the Leiden St. Elizabeth's hospital in 1667. His style is mostly in line with that of the Leiden fine painters."
2773,"LEFEBVRE, Claude","(b. 1637, Fontainebleau, d. 1675, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lefebvre/biograph.html,"
An enigmatic French portrait painter, Lefebvre was received into the Academy in Paris in 1663. He was one of the few independent talents who did not conform to the pattern set by Le Brun and later by his rival Pierre Mignard during the reign of Louis XIV. He has been neglected because he did not play a significant role in the all-important royal circle. The probable reason for Lefebvre's obscurity is that he failed to paint sitters of any importance."
2774,"LEFEBVRE, Jules-Joseph","(b. 1834, Tournan, d. 1911, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lefebvrj/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied in Leon Cogniet's studio from 1852 and completed at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1853 until he won the Prix de Rome in 1861. In Rome he was influenced by Mannerism and especially by Andrea del Sarto, whose works he copied. In his Boy Painting a Tragic Mask (1863; Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Auxerre) Lefebvre introduced the precise draughtsmanship, delicate colour and a lubricity characteristic of many of his later works."
2775,"LEFÈVRE, Robert","(b. 1755, Bayeux, d. 1830, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lefevre/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was the son of a Bayeux draper and originally worked as a law clerk before learning to paint, possibly in the studio of Pierre de Lesseline in Caen. Lefèvre quickly made a reputation for himself and established a sizeable practice in Normandy. About 1784 he went to Paris and entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Regnault, where he formed a close friendship with the artist and critic Charles-Paul Landon."
2776,"LEGA, Silvestro","(b. 1826, Modigliana, d. 1895, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lega/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. From 1843 to 1847 he attended the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence, studying drawing under Benedetto Servolini (1805-79) and Tommaso Gazzarini (1790-1853), then, briefly, painting under Giuseppe Bezzuoli. About 1847 he entered Luigi Mussini's school, where the teaching emphasized the 15th-century Florentine principles of drawing and orderly construction. Then and for some years afterwards he continued to attend the Scuola del Nudo of the Accademia. After fighting in the military campaigns for Italian independence (1848-49) Lega resumed his training, this time under Antonio Ciseri, executing his first large-scale painting, Doubting Thomas (1850; Modigliana, Ospedale). In 1852 he won the Concorso Trienniale dell'Accademia with David Placating Saul (1852; Florence, Accademia), a subject taken from Vittorio Alfieri's play Saul (1782)."
2777,"LEGEAY, Jean-Laurent","(b. ca. 1710, Paris, d. after 1788)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/legeay/biograph.html,"
French architect and draughtsman. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and won the Prix de Rome in 1732. His residence in Rome (1737-42) coincided with the arrival from Venice (1740) of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who was considerably influenced by Legeay's dramatic engravings of the monuments of Roman antiquity. Legeay worked with Piranesi and other engravers on illustrations for guide books on Rome, and he was an important figure in the cross-currents of influence and ideas between Piranesi and the French scholars in Rome."
2778,"LEGRAND, Étienne-François",(active 4th quarter 18th century in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/legrand/biograph.html,"
French architect, active in the 4th quarter of the 18th century in Paris. No biographical data are available.



"
2779,"LEGROS, Alphonse","(b. 1837, Dijon, d. 1911, Watford)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/legros/biograph.html,"
French (British) etcher, painter, sculptor and teacher. He is said to have been apprenticed at the age of 11 to a sign-painter, at which time he may also have attended classes at the École des Beaux-Arts in Dijon. He was employed as assistant on a decorative scheme in Lyon Cathedral before moving in 1851 to Paris, where he worked initially for the theatre decorator Charles-Antoine Cambon (1802-1875). He soon became a pupil of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897), whose methodical instruction and liberality in fostering individual talent proved of lasting benefit to Legros."
2780,"LEHMANN, Henri","(b. 1814, Kiel, d. 1882, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lehmann/biograph.html,"
French painter and teacher of German origin (his name before naturalization in 1846 was Karl Ernest Heinrich Salem). A pupil of his father, Leo Lehmann, and Ingres, whose studio he entered in 1831, Lehmann enjoyed a long and much honoured career. His work reflects his fervent admiration and emulation of Ingres, his respect for the art of the Nazarenes and his study of 17th-century Italian art."
2781,"LEIBL, Wilhelm","(b. 1844, Köln, d. 1900, Würzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leibl/biograph.html,"
German painter, draughtsman and etcher. In 1861 he abandoned his apprenticeship as a locksmith in order to train as a precision instrument maker, though a month or so later he decided to train as an artist, at first under the Cologne history painter and writer Hermann Becker (1817-1885)."
2782,"LEICHER, Felix Ivo","(b. 1727, Wagstadt, d. 1812, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leicher/biograph.html,"
Leicher came to Vienna from the Silesian town of Wagstadt, with the support of Piarist fathers. Already in 1751 he was a pupil at the Viennese Academy. In 1754 he won second prize in the academic competition, which made him a supported member of the Academy. He worked for a long time with Franz Anton Maulbertsch, with whom be was in friendly relations all his life. However, as he was not engaged in fresco painting, he employed the artistic message of Maulbertsch in panel painting. Primarily he painted altarpieces, in many cases for the churches where the frescoes were executed by Maulbertsch."
2783,"LEICKERT, Charles Henri Joseph","(b. 1816, Bruxelles, d. 1907, Mainz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leickert/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter active in the Netherlands. He first learned painting in The Hague under the supervision of landscape painters Bartholomeus van Hove, Wijnand Nuijen, and Andreas Schelfhout among many others. Leickert specialised in winter scenes, sometimes romanticising the sky in pale blues and bright pinks. He painted almost all his works in the Netherlands, from 1841-1848 in The Hague and from 1849-1883 in Amsterdam. In 1856, he became a member of the Royal Academy of Amsterdam. At the age of 71 he moved to Mainz, Germany where the Mittelrheinisches Landesmuseum holds his sketchbooks and drawings. He died in 1907.



"
2784,"LEINBERGER, Hans",(mentioned 1510-1530 in Landshut),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leinberg/biograph.html,"
German wood-carver and sculptor. He was the most eminent sculptor in Bavaria in the second and third decades of the 16th century. It is likely that he trained or was employed in the region of the Danube school, whether in Vienna or Regensburg. There is also a possibility that he began his career in Nuremberg. His centre of activity was in Landshut, where his life is documented from 1510 until 1530. He paid tax in 1510 on a house there and between 1516 and 1530 received various payments from the court of Ludwig X (reg 1516–45), but none of his projects for the court is known to have survived. More than 50 individual or multi-partite sculptures have been attributed to him. As a carver of figures for altarpieces, he worked mostly in lime-wood, but also produced sculpture in stone, bronze and fine-grained hardwoods, such as pear-wood and boxwood, selected according to the nature of the piece.



"
2785,"LEISTIKOW, Walter","(b. 1855, Bromberg, d. 1908, Schlachtensee)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leistiko/biograph.html,"
German painter, decorative artist, etcher, exhibition organizer and writer. He studied painting briefly in 1883, at the Akademie in Berlin, but he was dismissed after six months as 'untalented'. From 1883 to 1885 he trained with the painter Hermann Eschke (1823-1900) and from 1885 to 1887 with the Norwegian painter Hans Fredrik Gude (1825-1903). Gude had a decisive influence on the style of Leistikow's early works, as is especially clear in Leistikow's light coastal landscapes with figures. His most significant work from this period, however, is Brickworks near Eckernförde (1887)."
2786,"LEITCH, William Leighton","(b. 1804, Glasgow, d. 1883, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leitch/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He was a painter of landscapes and figurative subjects, most usually in watercolour. His early love of art was fostered by meetings with Sir Daniel MacNee (1806-1882) and Horatio McCulloch (1805-1867) and he soon abandoned the career in law planned for him by his manufacturer father. After employment at 19 as a scene painter at the Theatre Royal, he quickly moved to Cummnock where alongside MacNee and McCulloch he decorated snuffboxes for a living."
2787,"LELIE, Adriaan de","(b. 1755, Tilburg, d. 1820, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lelie/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was an autodidact, although in his early years he was probably taught by his fellow townsman Cornelis van Spaendonck. Together with Van Spaendonck, De Lelie left in 1773 for Antwerp, where he mainly painted history scenes and portraits. On the advice of friends, in 1783 De Lelie moved to Amsterdam. Here he developed into a popular portrait painter, especially among the enlightened, progressive citizens. Many prominent contemporaries in Dutch cultural life commissioned De Lelie to paint their portrait. His paintings of art galleries with visitors are the precursors of the conversation piece, a genre that became popular in the nineteenth century.



"
2788,"LELY, Sir Peter","(b. 1618, Soest, d. 1680, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lely/biograph.html,"
Dutch Baroque portrait painter known for his Van Dyck-influenced likenesses of the mid-17th-century English aristocracy. He was born as Pieter van der Faes in Soest, Westphalia, on 14 September 1618. He was the son of Abigael van Vliet, the daughter of a prominent Utrecht family, and Johan van der Faes, a captain in the regiment of Baron Walraven van Gent. The regiment, which served the Elector Palatine of Brandenburg, was quartered in Soest and various other parts of Westphalia around the time that Lely was born. According to Houbraken, Peter came to be known as Lely, the Dutch word for 'lily', because his father was born in a house in The Hague with 'a lily on the façade'. It was probably the house called 'Inde lelye', which by 1562 was said to belong to Hendrick Faes, who was presumably the painter's great-grandfather. In 1652, Lely's aunt, Odilia van der Faes, was still living in the house, and Lely himself may have lived there as well. In any event, he spent some time in The Hague before settling in Haarlem."
2789,"LEMBERGER, Georg","(b. 1490/95, Landshut, d. 1540, Magdeburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemberge/biograph.html,"
German painter and woodcut designer. His main achievement was to introduce the painting principles of the Danube school to Middle Germany; he worked largely in Protestant context. Between 1513 and 1515 Lemberger may have joined Altdorfer in Regensburg and collaborated on the miniatures in the Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I (Vienna, Albertina). He may also have visited Wolf Huber in Passau at that time. He moved to Leipzig in 1520."
2790,"LEMERCIER, Jacques","(b. ca. 1584, Pontoise, d. 1654, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemercie/biograph.html,"
French architect. He worked in Rome between 1607 and 1614, and studied the work of Giacomo della Porta. On his return to France, after several years working as an engineer building bridges, his first major commission was to complete the Parisian Church of the Oratorians (1616). Commissioned by Louis XIII, he built the Pavillon de l'Horloge at the Louvre (after 1624). After a large number of hotels and churches, he designed the palace and setting for the model city of Richelieu, for Cardinal Richelieu (begun 1631) and built the Palais Cardinal in Paris (now the Palais Royal, begun 1633)."
2791,"LEMMEN, Georges","(b. 1865, Schaerbeek, d. 1916, Ukkel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemmen/biograph.html,"
Belgian neo-impressionist painter. As the son of an architect, he was encouraged to study art. He started studying at the school of drawing at Sint Joost-ten-Noode, but soon dropped out. At about age 20, Georges Lemmen started painting. He exhibited at several different galleries in Brussels and in Ghent. In 1888 Lemmen joined the art group Les XX (Les Vingt). He met Théo van Rysselberghe, which led him to move towards Neo-Impressionism."
2792,"LEMOINE, Marie-Victoire","(b. 1754, Paris, d. 1820, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemoine/biograph.html,"
French painter, born in Paris. Like her two sisters Marie-Denise Villers and Marie-Élisabeth Gabiou, she became a painter. She was part of a generation of women who were able to enjoy considerable success as professional artists. Before this time, women were rarely able to become artists, with a few exceptions who were all sisters or daughters of artists. She was one of the first women artists to come into prominence in Paris once the official Salon was opened to women in 1791."
2793,"LEMOINE, Pierre-Antoine","(b. ca. 1605, Paris, d. 1665, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemoine1/biograph.html,"

French painter who studied under Vien. He won the Grand Prix de Rome in 1772 with The Children of Niobe Killed by Apollo and Diana (Rouen, Musée des Beaux-Arts). Lemonnier became an Academician in 1789 and exhibited historical and mythological subjects at the Salon from 1785-1814. He was administrator of the Gobelins Factory between 1810 and 1816.



"
2795,"LEMOT, François-Frédéric","(b. 1772, Lyon, d. 1827, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied drawing in Besançon before travelling to Paris, where he became a pupil of Claude Dejoux. In 1790 he was awarded the Prix de Rome with a low relief of the Judgement of Solomon (Paris, Ecole National Supérieur des Beax-Arts), but his studies in Rome were terminated in 1793, when he was conscripted into the French Revolutionary armies on the Rhine. In 1795 he was recalled to Paris to take part in a competition to sculpt a colossal statue of the French People, a project initiated by the wood-carver Jean-Louis David (father of David d'Angers) that came to nothing."

Sculptor, part of a family of French sculptors. Jean-Louis Lemoyne (1665-1755) was a pupil of Coysevox and is remembered mainly for portrait busts in his master's manner. His brother Jean-Baptiste I (1679-1731) was a figure and portrait sculptor of no great distinction. Jean-Louis's son, Jean-Baptiste II (1704-1778) was the outstanding member of the family, becoming official sculptor to Louis XV. He did much large-scale work at Versailles and elsewhere, but is renowned particularly for the vivacity of his portraits."

2799,"LEMOYNE, François","(b. 1688, Paris, d. 1737, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lemoyne1/biograph.html,"
François Lemoyne (or Lemoine), French painter. He was one of the leading decorative artists of the day, continuing the grand tradition of Le Brun but adapting it to the lighter taste of the court of Louis XV, to whom he became official painter in 1736. Much of his work can be seen at Versailles, notably in the Salon d'Hercule. He was a man of wide pictorial culture, learning from Rubens in his use of colour and from Bolognese painters in his clarity and grace of drawing. The easy fluency of his style belies his disturbed personality; he committed suicide a few hours after completing Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy (Wallace Collection, London, 1737).



"
2800,"LENBACH, Franz von","(b. 1836, Schrobenhausen, d. 1904, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lenbach/biograph.html,"
German painter. The son of a master builder, he trained for his father's profession at the Königliche Landwirtschafts- und Gewerbeschule in Landshut, also working from 1851 in the sculpture studio of Anselm Sickinger (1807-73) in Munich. His elder brother, Karl August Lenbach (1828-1847), had already become involved with painting, and it was through him that Franz Lenbach met Johann Baptist Hofner (1832-1913), an artist who had studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich. They went on sketching expeditions together, and Hofner introduced him to plein-air painting. After spending two semesters at the Polytechnische Schule in Augsburg (1852-53), and some months in the studio of Albert Gräfle (1807-1889), a portrait painter in Munich, Lenbach entered the Akademie in Munich in 1854. In 1857 he attended the classes of Karl Theodor Piloty (later von Piloty), who was renowned for his history paintings."
2801,"LENCKHARDT, Adam","(b. 1610, Würzburg, d. 1661, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lenckhar/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and ivory-carver. He was the son of Nikolaus Lenckhardt (d 1632), a sculptor, and first trained with his father (1622-24). He then set out on his journeyman's travels, visiting Italy in 1632. To this period of his career belongs an ivory panel representing the Lamentation (c. 1630; London, Victoria and Albert Museum). Its composition may have been based on an etching (1597) by Annibale Carracci, which was in turn indebted to Raphael. Rather more accomplished are two ivory panels of the Lamentation and the Assumption of the Virgin (both 1632; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art). Although Lenckhardt executed them while still a journeyman, they already display his complete mastery of his art."
2802,"LENNÉ, Peter Joseph","(b. 1789, Bonn, d. 1866, Potsdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lenne/biograph.html,"
German landscape architect and gardener. He was the son of the court and university gardener Peter Joseph Lenné the Elder (1756-1821). As director general of the Royal Prussian palaces and parks in Potsdam and Berlin, his work shaped the development of 19th-century German garden design in the Neoclassical style. His parks were laid-out according to the principles of the English landscape garden."
2803,"LENS, Andries Cornelis","(b. 1739, Antwerpen, d. 1822, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, an artist with an international reputation, a representative of the neo-classical ideal. He visited Rome and was much taken with the ideas of Mengs and Winckelmann and returned to home to become the leader of a school. His paintings are the result of his study of antique and Italian masters, but also his reading of classical and biblical writings (Ariadne on Naxos, Brussels Museum). In 1763, Lens became the director of the Antwerp Academy,



"
2804,"LENTINI, Riccardo da",(active 13th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lentini/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. On the basis of a document of 1239, he was appointed by Frederick II, Emperor and King of Sicily as supervisor of all castles constructed in Sicily that time. Accordingly, scholars believe that Riccardo may have built a series of buildings (maybe designed or just directed on construction sites): the Augusta Castle, a nursery in San Cosmo, the Maniace Castle in Syracuse, the castle of Caltagirone (no longer existing), the castle of Milazzo, the castle of Lentini (no longer existing)."

Italian painter, son of Bernardino del Signoraccio, a minor Pistoian painter, and brother of the more famous Fra Paolino (Paolo di Bernardino del Signoraccio). Leonardo was the fourth son of Bernardino and three years younger than his famous brother Fra Paolino. He was baptised on 13th December 1491. In the Priorista Franchi he is named Lorenzo but in his baptismal certificate he is correctly named Leonardo. No further biographical details are known, the baptismal certificate is the only surviving document from his lifetime."
2806,LEONARDO DI SER GIOVANNI,(active 1358–1371 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leonard/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith. Trained in the workshop of the Florentine goldsmith Francesco di Niccolò, he matriculated in the goldsmiths' guild, the Arte della Seta, in 1358. In 1361 Francesco was commissioned to execute nine narrative reliefs of episodes from the Old Testament for the antependium of the silver altar of S Jacopo in Pistoia. Documents of 13 April 1363 and 30 June 1364 indicate that Leonardo assisted with this work, which was completed in 1364. The relief panels were originally to the left of the scenes on the main face of the antependium, to which they relate chronologically and iconographically: the altarpiece was dismantled in 1381, and the two lateral faces were transposed. Francesco was the principal author of the reliefs, but in the last two panels depicting the Birth of the Virgin and Betrothal of the Virgin a different hand has been identified, possibly that of Leonardo."

2808,LEONARDO DA PISTOIA,"(b. ca. 1483, Pistoia, d. after 1518, Pistoia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leonardp/biograph.html,"
Italian painter in Pistoia (real name: Leonardo di Francesco di Lazzero Malatesta), not to be confused with another artist from Pistoia, also known as Leonardo da Pistoia though his real name was Leonardo Grazia (or Grazzi)."
2809,"LEONBRUNO, Lorenzo","(b. 1489, Mantova, d. ca. 1537, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leonbrun/biograph.html,"
Lorenzo Leonbruno (also Lorenzo de Leombeni), Italian painter. He was trained in the workshop of Andrea Mantegna and worked as an assistant to Pietro Perugino in Florence between 1504 and 1506. He also had formative contact with several Emilian artists, including Correggio and Dosso Dossi, whom he probably met in Mantua before going to Florence. In 1511 he briefly visited Venice and returned to Mantua the following year to work under Lorenzo Costa the Elder on frescoes of Apollo and the nine Muses in the Palazzo di San Sebastiano, Mantua (destroyed); he possibly assisted Costa on later commissions as well. Leonbruno worked under the patronage of Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua, and, later, of her son Federico II, 1st Duke of Mantua."
2810,"LEONI, Leone","(b. 1509, Menaggio, d. 1590, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leoni/leone/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist sculptor who worked in many parts of Italy and in the service of the emperor Charles V in Germany and the Netherlands. He was trained as a goldsmith but none of his works in that medium survives."
2811,"LEONI, Pompeo","(b. 1533, d. 1608, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leoni/pompeo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, son of Leone Leoni. 

He has long been overshadowed by his father, although he was an accomplished sculptor who produced an impressive body of work. This is partly due to their close working relationship, which continued until Leone's death. Pompeo was trained by Leone, assisted him with the commissions from Charles V and Mary, Queen of Hungary, and accompanied these works to Spain in 1556 on the retirement of Charles V. Soon after his arrival in Spain, Pompeo entered the service of the regent, Joanna of Austria. He produced several medals in 1557, but in 1558 work came to a halt when he was sentenced by the Inquisition to a year's confinement in a monastery because of his unorthodox opinions. In 1564 he helped to complete his father's bronzes, and in 1570 he designed a series of colossal, fictive bronze statues for the triumphal arches erected to celebrate the entry into Madrid of Anne of Austria, Philip II's new wife."
2812,"LEONI, James","(b. ca. 1686, Venezia?, d. 1746, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leoni_j/biograph.html,"
James (Giacomo) Leoni, English architect of Italian origin. Apparently a Venetian, he was at the court of Elector Johann Wilhelm of the Palatinate at Düsseldorf from 1708. There he was influenced by the architect Count Matteo Alberti (?1660-1716), with whom he probably worked on the Elector's hunting-lodge, Schloss Bensburg, near Cologne."
2813,"LEONI, Ottavio","(b. 1578, Roma, d. 1630, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leoni_o/biograph.html,"

Italian painter and printmaker. He was the son of the Paduan-born Ludovico Leoni (1542-1612), a maker of medals and wax relief portraits. Although Ottavio was active entirely in Rome, where his father had also worked and died, he was often known as 'il Padovano' because of the family origins. He first trained with his father."
2814,"LEOPARDI, Alessandro",(active 1482-1522 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leopardi/biograph.html,"
Italian bronze-founder. Born into a well-known Venetian family, he is mentioned in 1482, first as a goldsmith and then as a jeweller, which suggests that he might have been carving hard stones. In 1484 he was employed at the Mint as an engraver of dies. Exiled in August 1487 for his part in an inheritance fraud, he was recalled from Ferrara in September 1488 to cast the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni from the clay model left by Verrocchio at his death. He completed the casting, putting his signature on the girth strap (ALEXANDER LEOPARDUS V.F. OPUS), and designed and executed the high pedestal with marble columns and bronze frieze himself. His execution of the pedestal clearly shows his familiarity with the Classical orders. The monument was erected in the Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo in 1494."

François-Bernard Lépicié was an engraver who became secretary and historiographer of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, in which capacity he compiled a catalogue of the paintings in the French royal collection and an important set of lives of the Premiers Peintres du Roi. His wife, Renée-Elisabeth Lépicié (née Marlie; 1714-73), was also an engraver, signing a number of plates after François Boucher, Jean-Siméon Chardin, Noël Hallé and other artists. Their son Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié (1735-1784) was a painter specializing in large historical and religious canvases, although he is perhaps best known for his charming small-scale genre scenes."

French painter and printmaker. He was the son and pupil of the painter and lithographer Anne Pierre Leprince, and he was the elder brother of the painters Robert Leopold Leprince (1800-1847) and Gustave Leprince (1810-1837). He received a medal at his first Salon of 1819 for one of six entries, five of which were landscapes of 17th century Dutch inspiration, which came possibly via the work of Jean-Louis Demarne."
2819,"LEQUEU, Jean-Jacques","(b. 1757, Rouen, d. ca. 1826, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lequeu/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer. Born in Rouen, he won a scholarship to go to Paris. Following the French revolution Lequeu's architectural career never took off. He spent time preparing the Architecture Civile, a book intended for publication, but which was never published. He became a civil servant working as a surveyor and a cartographer until his retirement in 1815."
2820,"LERAMBERT, Louis II","(b. 1620, Paris, d. 1670, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leramber/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, part of a Parisian family of sculptors that included four generations of court artists. He in 1637 inherited the court position caring for the Antiquities and Marbles of the King, which had become hereditary in his family. He trained in the atelier of Simon Vouet, recently returned from Rome; there he met the sculptor Jacques Sarazin. He was close friends with Le Brun and Le Nôtre and worked in the studio of Sarazin."
2821,"LEROLLE, Henry","(b. 1848, Paris, d. 1929, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lerolle/biograph.html,"
French painter and collector. He was initially a pupil of Louis Lamothe (1822-1869) in 1864 but never went to the École des Beaux-Arts. Independent in outlook, he began working in the Louvre, where he met Albert Besnard and Jean-Louis Forain, and made copies after Nicolas Poussin, Veronese and Rubens. He attended the Académie Suisse and exhibited at the Salon from 1868."
2822,"LEROY DE BARDE, Alexandre-Isidore","(b. 1777, Montreuil, d. 1828, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leroy/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in England. An amateur virtuoso of still-life watercolour painting, Leroy de Barde appears to have been entirely self-taught. In 1792 he emigrated to England with his monarchist family to avoid the Revolution. The first mention of him as an artist is as an 'honorary' exhibitor at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1797 when he showed two watercolours, Fruit and Grapes (untraced). He styled himself 'Le Chevalier de Barde' and signed his works thus. He also exhibited in Royal Academy exhibitions in 1800, 1801 and 1802 with various flower paintings and a composition of Moths and Butterflies. The paintings exhibited in 1800 are still in the Royal Academy: Double Narcissus and Lilies of the Valley, Lilac Branch and Green Oak.



"

2825,"LESSING, Karl Friedrich","(b. 1808, Breslau, d. 1880, Karlsruhe)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lessing/biograph.html,"
German painter, great-nephew of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781), philosopher, dramatist, and critic.  He studied architecture in Berlin at the Königliche Bau-Akademie under Karl Friedrich Schinkel, before transferring to the Kunstakademie, where he became a pupil of Wilhelm Schadow in 1825. The next year Lessing followed Schadow to Düsseldorf, where the latter had been appointed Director of the Kunstakademie. He exercised great influence on the Düsseldorf school; his picture Das trauernde Königspaar (Mourning Royal Couple) brought him great popularity. In 1837, he received a gold medal at Paris; he was a member of the Berlin Academy and was the recipient of several orders. "
2826,"LETHIÈRE, Guillaume","(b. 1760, Sainte-Anne, d. 1832. Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lethiere/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was the illegitimate son of a white government official in Guadeloupe and a freed black slave. Although his real name was Guillon, as the third child of the family he called himself Letiers, Lethiers and finally, from 1799, when recognized by his father, Lethière. While accompanying his father to France in 1774 Lethière entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Descamps at the Académie in Rouen, where he won a drawing prize for an académie in 1776."
2827,"LEU, Hans the Younger","(b. ca. 1490, Zürich, d. 1531, Gubel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leu/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter and draughtsman. He probably served his apprenticeship in Zurich in the workshop of his father, Hans Leu I, who perhaps was one of the Carnation Masters. Travelling as a journeyman, soon after his father's death, Hans the Younger apparently attached himself to Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg. From the style of his free-hand drawings, it can be inferred that he also worked with Hans Baldung, perhaps in Strasbourg and no doubt, c. 1512-13, in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he may have painted the landscape backgrounds of Baldung's Schnewlin Altar in the cathedral."
2828,"LEUTZE, Emanuel Gottlieb","(b. 1816, Schwabisch Gmünd, d. 1868, Washington)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leutze/biograph.html,"
German-born painter who lived in America from 1825 to 1841 and again from 1859 and is usually considered a member of the American School. He is remembered mainly for his Washington Crossing the Delaware (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1851), painted in Düsseldorf, where he spent most of his career, and for another work that similarly appeals more for its patriotic sentiments than for any aesthetic merit - his large mural Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way (1861-62) in the Capitol at Washington. His portraits and rare landscapes are more distinguished, but remain virtually unknown.



"
2829,"LEVECQ, Jacobus","(b. 1634, Dordrecht, d. 1675, Dordrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/levecq/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of Jacques Levecq, a merchant with ties to Dordrecht's artistic community. Levecq is recorded as having business dealings with the city's confraternity of artists, perhaps a connection gained through Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp, a fellow member of Dordrecht's Waalse Kerk. Such ties may have encouraged Jacobus to become an artist, and move to Amsterdam to train with Rembrandt. The approximate timing of his instruction is known, for in 1653 Rembrandt signed a document confirming the authenticity of a painting by Paul Bril before an Amsterdam notary, and Levecq undersigned the document, where he is listed as one of Rembrandt's students. By 1655, Levecq had returned to Dordrecht where he became a member of the guild."
2830,"LEVITAN, Isaak Ilyich","(b. 1860, Kibarta, d. 1900, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/levitan/biograph.html,"
Russian painter of Lithuanian birth. He studied under Savrassov and Polenov at the School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Moscow between 1873 and 1885. As a Jew, he was from time to time refused entry to the city. He finally received a silver medal but was only given a diploma as a teacher of calligraphy. In the 1890s he traveled to France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and Germany."
2831,"LEVITSKY, Dmitry Grigorevich","(b. 1735, Kiev, d. 1822, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/levitsky/biograph.html,"
Russian painter of Ukrainian birth. His father was Grigory Levitsky-Nos (1697-1769), a priest, engraver and painter. His first art teacher was his father, later he became a pupil of Aleksey Antropov who came to Kiev to paint the Cathedral of St. Andrew (1752-55). In the late 1750s Levitsky went with Antropov to St. Petersburg, where he stayed until 1764; he continued with lessons from Antropov to whom, it appears, he owed the objectivity that was to characterize his work. It is probable that he also studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, attending classes under Louis Lagrenée. Levitsky worked with Antropov on the decoration of triumphal arches in Moscow for Catherine II's coronation in 1762."
2832,"LEVY, Vaclav","(b. 1820, Nebreziny, d. 1870, Pilsen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/levy/biograph.html,"
Czech sculptor, one of the pioneers of the modern style in his country. He showed an early aptitude for carving, creating several figures of the Virgin Mary and crucifixes. He was sent away for an education, first to the Abbey in Pilsen, then to the Augustinian Monastery in Schlüsselburg, where he became a cook. In 1845, Levy began creating the reliefs on a wooded hill near Liboch that are now known as Klácelka."
2833,LUCAS van Leyden,"(b. 1494, Leiden, d. 1533, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leyden/biograph.html,"
Lucas Van Leyden (real name Lucas Hugensz or Jacobsz.), Netherlandish engraver and painter,  born and mainly active in Leiden, who was among the first Dutch exponents of genre painting and is generally regarded as one of the finest engravers in the history of art. He was the pupil of his father, from whose hand no works are known, and of Cornelis Engebrechtsz., but both of these were painters whereas Lucas himself was principally an engraver. Where he learnt engraving is unknown, but he was highly skilled in that art at a very early age: the earliest known print by him (Mohammed and the Murdered Monk) dates from 1508, when he was perhaps only 14, yet reveals no trace of immaturity in inspiration or technique."
2834,"LEYDEN, Aertgen van","(b. 1498, Leiden, d. 1564, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leyden_a/biograph.html,"
Aertgen van Leyden (also Aertgen Claesz.), Netherlandish painter, draughtsman, and designer of stained glass. Some sources incorrectly name him as a brother of the more famous Lucas van Leyden. Little is known about him, and few works can be securely associated with him. In 1516 he was a pupil of Cornelis Engebrechtsz and he worked in Leiden until his death in 1564. The biographer Karel van Mander describes Aertgen's style as extremely varied, with marked stylistic changes.



"
2835,"LEYGEBE, Paul Carl","(b. 1664, Nürnberg, d. 1756, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leygebe/biograph.html,"

Jan August Henri Leys (baron) was a Belgian painter and printmaker. He studied under Wappers at the Antwerp Academy. In 1835 he went to Paris where he was influenced by the Romantic movement. After his visit to Holland in 1839 he reproduced many of the characteristics of the Dutch genre painters. He had travelled in Germany in 1852."
2839,"LEYSTER, Judith","(b. 1609, Haarlem, d. 1660, Heemstede)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leyster/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of genre scenes, portraits, and still-life, probably a pupil of Frans Hals in Haarlem, where she spent most of her career (she also worked in Amsterdam). In 1636 she married Jan Miense Molenaer, with whom she shared a studio, using the same models and props. Leyster was one of Hals's best followers and her work has sometimes passed as his, an example being the Lute Player in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Her monogram includes a star, a play on 'Ley/ster' (lode star).



"
2840,"LEYTENS, Gysbrecht","(b. 1586, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1656, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/leytens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draftsman. His work was formerly attributed to an anonymous painter,  the Master of Winter Landscapes. We now know that the painter, identified thanks to a painting bearing his monogram and kept in a private Dutch collection, was baptised in Antwerp on 4th April 1586. He began his apprenticeship with Jacob Vrolijck, before becoming a master in Antwerp in 1611. Married to Maria van Omel, he was a member of the Olijftak between 1615 and 1625, and a captain in Antwerp's Civic Guard between 1624 and 1628; all signs of a comfortable social position. Known for his collaborations with Frans Francken II and Sebastian Vrancx, his pupils included the young Roccotailliato who came from southern Europe to learn the art of Flemish landscape painting."

French draughtsman, printmaker, painter and illustrator. He was the only son of a village schoolmaster and his precocious drawing skill won him an annual grant from the state. In 1863 he went to Paris and became a student at the Petite Ecole, where one of his teachers was Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, famed for his method of training the visual memory. Jean-Charles Cazin, a fellow pupil, became a lifelong friend and Lhermitte later got to know Alphonse Legros, Henri Fantin-Latour, Jules Dalou and Rodin, who had all studied at the school."
2842,"LIBALT, Gottfried","(b. ca, 1610, Hamburg, d. 1666, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/libalt/biograph.html,"
Gottfried Libalt (or Libaldt), German painter of still-lifes, landscapes and religious reliefs. His oeuvre today includes 30 paintings and one piece of graphic art. In the Saint-Petri-Kirche, Hamburg two famous oil paintings by the artist, the Dream of Jacob, and the Birth of Christ can be found."
2843,LIBERALE da Verona,"(b. c. 1445, Verona, d. 1526/29, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liberale/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator, painter and woodcut designer (originally Liberale di Jacopo dalla Biava). His father, the baker Jacopo, came from Monza; his mother, Jacoba, was the daughter of the Veronese painter Zeno Solimani (active c. 1438) and sister of the painter Nicolò Solimani (active c. 1462-1493). The latter, according to Vasari, was Liberale's teacher (but mistakenly called Vincenzo di Stefano in the Vite). Liberale is documented in Verona in 1455 and 1465, but works from this period are not known."
2844,"LIBERALE, Giorgio","(b. 1527, Udine, d. ca. 1579)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liberalg/biograph.html,"
Giorgio Liberale was an Italian artist from Udine who had been working for the imperial court in Prague. He designed over 500 small woodcuts for the first Latin edition of Pietro Andrea Mattioli's illustrated edition of Dioscurides' Materia medica. Liberale also designed nearly 600 large blocks that appeared in the later Prague edition of this text.

Marco Liberi was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He was the son of the painter Pietro Liberi in Padua, and received his training under his father. He painted mythologic and historic cabinet paintings.



"
2846,"LIBERI, Pietro","(b. 1605, Padova, d. 1687, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liberi/pietro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He moved to Venice at an early age and studied with Alessandro Varotari (il Padovanino). Travels from 1628 to 1638 took him to Constantinople, Tunis and several European countries. In Rome from 1638 to 1640, he copied the frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael, studied the works of the Carracci, Pietro da Cortona and Guido Reni, and also came under the prevailing influence of Gianlorenzo Bernini. His earliest known work, the Rape of the Sabines (1641; Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale), richly reflects this experience of Rome. On his return journey to Venice (c. 1643) he stopped in Bologna and may have seen works by Emilian artists, from Correggio to Reni, in Parma."
2847,"LICINIO, Bernardino","(b. ca. 1489, Poscante, d. ca. 1565, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/licinio/biograph.html,"
Venetian painter of Bergamese descent, he was trained within the tradition of Giovanni Bellini, possibly in his workshop, and followed a successful career in the city. His own workshop produced half-length panels of the Virgin and Child, altarpieces and numerous individual and group portraits. Although not an innovator, Bernardino remained open to developments in contemporary Venetian painting."
2848,"LIEBERMANN, Max","(b. 1847, Berlin, d. 1935, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lieberma/biograph.html,"
German genre painter and etcher. He went to Paris in 1873, where he was impressed by the Barbizon school of painters. In Holland he was influenced by Frans Hals and Jozef Israëls. His early works were realistic, but beginning about 1890 he developed a style closely related to Impressionism. As leader of the Berlin Secession group (1898-1910), he was instrumental in bringing French Impressionism to Germany, where younger artists were already moving toward expressionism."
2849,"LIÉDET, Loyset","(b. ca. 1420, Hesdin, d. 1479, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liedet/biograph.html,"
Flemish manuscript illuminator, active first in Hesdin and then in Bruges, where he became a guild member in 1469. His patrons included Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, dukes of Burgundy, and he was perhaps the most prolific illuminator of his time.

Loyset Liédet spent most of his career working for the powerful dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. A two-volume copy of a historical text contains his earliest known work as an illuminator, which the scribe recorded as being completed in 1454 in Hesdin, France, presumably Liédet's birthplace. His early work showed the influence of the painter and illuminator Simon Marmion, a French illuminator also active at the Burgundian court."
2850,"LIEFERINXE, Josse",(active 1493-1508 in Marseille),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lieferin/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in France. A native of Hainaut, in the diocese of Cambrai, he may have come from Lieferinge near Enghien. He is documented in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence from 1493 to 1505, often being described as a 'Picard painter'. In 1503 he married Michelle, one of the daughters of Jean Changenet, the most prominent painter of the time in Avignon, with whom he may have trained. The last great representative of the 'School of Avignon', Lieferinxe appears to have concentrated on the production of altarpieces.


"
2851,"LIEMAKER, Nicolaas de","(b. 1601, Gent, d. 1646, Gent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liemaker/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He became independent painter in 1625, and seems to have taken Van den Heuvel's version of Ghent Caravaggism as his starting point. In his later work, Rubens's monumentality and motifs played a significant role. From about 1635 he wanted to increase the effect of movement, and for this sixteenth-century Mannerism must have seemed more suitable than the contemporary dynamic of High Baroque."
2852,"LIES, Jozef Hubert","(b. 1821, Antwerpen, d. 1865, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lies/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter of historical and genre scenes, landscapes and portraits. He was the pupil of Nicaise de Keyser (1813-1887) at the Academy of Antwerp. He became successful with historical compositions painted in the tradition of his friend Henri Leys. He received the silver medal in Antwerp (1849), the gold medal in Brussels (1851, 1852) and the insignia of the Order of Leopold (1858). For his qualities as scholar, in 1849 he was named secretary of the Vereniging van Antwerpse Kunstenaars."
2853,"LIEVENSZ., Jan","(b. 1607, Leiden, d. 1674, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lievens/biograph.html,"
Jan Lievens (or Lievensz.), Dutch painter of portraits and religious, allegorical and genre subjects. He was a friend and contemporary of Rembrandt and a pupil of Lastman in Amsterdam. Then shared a studio with Rembrandt in Leiden in the later 1620s: many works of this period show one influencing the other. Lievens went to England, probably in 1632 after Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, but he was in Antwerp by 1635, where he was influenced by the courtly style of Van Dyck. He returned to Holland in 1639 and became a successful painter of portraits and allegories. Raising of Lazarus is a good example of his works.

2854,"LIEZEN-MAYER, Sándor","(b. 1839, Gyõr, d. 1898, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liezen-m/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He studied at Carl Rahl in Vienna and Munich in 1857 where he began painting romantic historic pictures in Piloty's style. Due to his harmonic colouring and well-balanced composition, the illustrations for Goethe's Faust, Schiller's Bandits and Das Lied von der Glocke, brought him a lot of success. In 1870 he was invited to paint the portrait of Emperor Franz Josef in Vienna. After the years 1880-83, when he was the director of the Stuttgart Academy, he returned to Munich where he worked as a teacher in the art school. His major pictures: St. Elizabeth of Hungary (painted in two, almost identical versions), Queen Elisabeth Signs the Death Sentence of Mary Stuart, Venus and Tannhäuser, and Faust and Marguerite.

2855,"LIGARI, Pietro","(b. 1686, Ardenno, d. 1752, Sondrio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/ligari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect, considered to be the most important 18th-century painter in Valtellina. He was born into a bourgeois family which took its name from the village Ligari where they lived. He was the founder of a family of painters linked to their land of origin but culturally open and active outside Valtellina. His son Caesar (1716-1770) and daughter Vittoria (1713-1783) were also painters."
2856,"LIGETI, Antal","(b. 1823, Nagykároly, d. 1890, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/ligeti/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. Ligeti, who worked as a merchant initially, learnt to paint under Károly Markó in Italy in 1845. After returning to Hungary from his trip to Palestina and the Near-East, he was appointed the guard of the Gallery of the Hungarian National Museum. His religious romantic landscapes reflect the impact of Markó and the journeys to the East. His major works: Catalogue of the Pictures in the Hungarian National Museum with Short Biographies (1870), and Mihály Munkácsy's Youth (1891).

Limbourg (also spelled Limburg), three Netherlandish brothers who were the most famous of all late Gothic illuminators. They synthesized the achievements of contemporary illuminators into a style characterized by subtlety of line, painstaking technique, and minute rendering of detail. The sons of a sculptor, Arnold van Limbourg, they were also the nephews of Jean Malouel, court painter to the Duke of Burgundy, and are sometimes known by the name ""Malouel."" The brothers worked together, and although the most celebrated appears to have been the eldest brother, Pol, it is difficult to distinguish their individual styles.

Léonard Limosin (also Limousin), French enameller, etcher, painter and miniature painter, the most accomplished member of one of the best-known families of enamellers working in Limoges during the 16th century. He was the best-known enameller of Renaissance France and may have learnt that trade in the Pénicaud workshop in Limoges. Encouraged by the Bishop of Limoges, Jean de Langeac, who probably put him in touch with the court of Francis I, Limosin produced painted enamels on copper in all forms, including plates and plaques with mythological and religious subjects, tableware and caskets. His chief speciality was the interpretation in enamels of portrait drawings by artists of the school of Jean and François Clouet, such as that of Anne de Montmorency (Paris, Louvre)."
2862,"LIN, Herman van","(b. ca. 1623, Utrecht, d. 1681, Schenkenschans)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lin/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was mainly active in Utrecht, where he was first recorded in 1659 when he served on the committee of the local guild; he did so repeatedly, serving as dean in 1668, 1669 and 1670. His main subjects were battle scenes and landscapes. He was influenced by his slightly older townsman Dirck Stoop and Philips Wouwerman. His works show a great variety. many are signed 'H.v.Lin' and Italianate elements are often incorporated, but that was customary at Utrecht in those days."
2863,"LINARD, Jacques","(b. ca. 1600, Paris, d. 1645, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/linard/biograph.html,"
French still-life painter, who spent his career in Paris. In 1631 he was named as a 'valet de chambre' of Louis XIII. His pictures are strongly influenced by the Antwerp school of still-life painters, especially Jan Brueghel. Linard delights by his use of bright colour, his painstaking work and a curiously powerful juxtaposition of boxes and flowers. His present status is only slightly below that of Moillon, Baugin and Stoskopff.

Flemish painter and draughtsman, active also in Italy. Before becoming master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1632, van Lint worked for several years with Artus Wolffort; he recorded their collaboration in his diary. During these years he frequently copied the more famous paintings in Antwerp's churches, not only those by Peter Paul Rubens, but also works by older masters such as Marten de Vos and the Francken brothers. His earliest known painting, an Adoration of the Shepherds (1632; Vienna, Salesianerinnenkirche), shows a clear indebtedness to Wolffort's style, which was in the pre-Rubensian, academic manner of Otto van Veen."
2868,"LINT, Hendrik Frans van","(b. 1684, Antwerpen, d. 1763, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lint_h/biograph.html,"
Hendrik Frans van Lint, called Lo Studio, Flemish painter, active in Italy. A native of Antwerp, Van Lint moved definitively to Rome in circa 1710 and joined the confraternity of Northern painters working there, called the Schildersbent. He soon earned his nickname 'Lo Studio' due to the painstaking precision with which he rendered both the figures and architecture in his paintings, and he often included his pseudonym when signing his works. By the 1730s he had already made a name for himself painting vedute of buildings and monuments in and around Rome."
2869,"LINTHORST, Jacobus","(b. 1745, Amsterdam, d. 1815, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/linthors/biograph.html,"

Andrea di Lione (Leone), Italian painter. An eclectic and varied artist, he painted scenes from the Old and New Testaments, Roman history and mythology as well as still-lifes. He studied in Naples with the late Mannerist artist Belisario Corenzio (active 1590-1646), with whom he collaborated on frescoes of battle scenes for the Palazzo Reale in Naples (in situ). Then, attracted by the battle paintings of Aniello Falcone, he entered Falcone's studio, and his red chalk studies of the nude (e.g. Male Nude, Museum of Art, Philadelphia) and of parts of the body reflect the rigorous academic training that he received there."

Swiss pastellist, painter, printmaker and writer. He was born to French Protestant parents, who had fled to Switzerland after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Having studied with the miniature painter Daniel Gardelle in Geneva, in 1723 he travelled to Paris, where until 1726 he was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Massé. In 1734 he submitted his only known history painting, King David and the High Priest Abimelech in the Tabernacle (untraced), for the painting prize of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, but it was rejected. He subsequently travelled to Naples and then to Rome, where he executed a portrait of Pope Clement XII (untraced). In Florence he met Sir William Ponsonby (1704-93), later 2nd Earl of Bessborough, whom he accompanied to the Levant in 1738, breaking the journey in Capri, Messina, Syracuse, Malta and the Greek islands; there, seduced by the beauty of Eastern dress, he made a large number of acute and charming drawings in black and red chalks (Paris, Louvre; Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale)."
2873,"LIPPARINI, Ludovico","(b. 1800, Bologna, d. 1856, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lipparin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In Venice, he followed the teachings of Liberale Cossa and especially those of Teodoro Matteini, as shown by his Socrates Finds Alcibiades in the Gynaeceum, painted between 1829 and 1830. In the modern style inspired by his master and father-in-law, Matteini, Ludovico begun producing portraits (memorable is that of Leopoldo Cicognara, 1825, now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). In 1831, he became professor of Principles of Drawing at the Accademia and in 1848 professor of Principles of Painting. In 1845, he went in the direction of historical Romanticism, which Hayez had already undertaken some years earlier.

He was brought up as an unwanted child in the Carmelite friary of the Carmine, where he took his vows in 1421. Unlike the Dominican Fra Angelico, however, Lippi was a reluctant friar and had a scandalous love affair with a nun, Lucrezia Buti, who bore his son Filippino and a daughter Alessandra. The couple was released from their vows and allowed to marry, but Lippi still signed himself ""Frater Philippus"". His biography (romantically embroidered to include capture by pirates) is one of the most colourful in Vasari's Lives and has given rise to the picture of a wordly Renaissance artist, rebelling against the discipline of the Church. He must certainly have had a more eventful life than most, but there is little documentary evidence of his character and personality.

"
2875,"LIPPI, Filippino","(b. ca. 1457, Prato, d. 1504, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lippi/flippino/biograph.html,"Florentine painter, the son and pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi. who died when the boy was about 12. The boy completed his father's work (or at least cleared up his estate) in Spoleto (the final receipts for Filippo's frescoes in the Spoleto Cathedral was signed by Filippino) and he set off alone for Florence on 1 January 1470. He also studied with Botticelli and learned much from his expressive use of line, but Filippino's style, although sensitive and poetic, is more robust than his master's. The first certainly datable work by Filippino is the Annunciation on two tondi (1483-84, San Gimignano).

2876,"LIPPI, Lorenzo","(b. 1606, Firenze, d. 1665, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lippi_l/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and poet. He was trained by Matteo Rosselli, with whom he worked for many years in close partnership. His collaboration was sometimes anonymous but is documented from 1622, when they decorated the ceiling of the Sala della Stufa (Florence, Palazzo Pitti), to 1631-32, when they worked together on lunettes portraying St Francis Adoring the Child and St Catherine in Prison (Florence, San Gaetano)."
2877,LIPPO D'ANDREA DI LIPPO,"(b. ca. 1370, Firenze, d. before 1451)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lippo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, formerly known as Pseudo-Ambrogio di Baldese. He enrolled in the Compagnia di San Luca in 1411, the same year that he received a commission, along with Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, Ambrogio di Baldese, and Alvaro di Pietro, for the fresco decoration of the façade of the Palazzo del Ceppo in Prato. An undocumented tradition assigning the frescoes in the Nerli Chapel at Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, to a painter named Lippo in 1402 has reasonably been connected with Lippo d'Andrea, and it must be assumed that, like Lorenzo Monaco, he was active at least as early as the last decade of the fourteenth century. The only other notice referring to Lippo d'Andrea in connection with a work of art is of 1435-36, when he was selected along with Bicci di Lorenzo, Giovanni dal Ponte, and Rossello di Jacopo Franchi to paint frescoes of the apostles in the tribune chapels of Florence cathedral on the occasion of Pope Eugene IV's consecration of the newly completed dome. By 1442 Lippo d'Andrea had ceased painting and in his tax declaration of 1447 he claimed to be unable to earn a living by his craft. He was dead by 1451."
2878,LIPPO DI BENIVIENI,(active 1296-1320 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lippo_b/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The earliest documentary reference to the artist records the apprenticeship of a certain Nerio di Binduccio to him in 1296, which suggests that Lippo was an established figure by this date. He is further recorded as a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Florence from 1312 to 1320. No documented works by him are known. The documented dates make Lippo a contemporary of Giotto, but the works attributed to him show a much stronger response to Sienese rather than Florentine painting, particularly that of the followers of Duccio."

In 1383 he was paid for a polyptych showing the Virgin and Child with Sts Benedict, Andrew, John the Baptist and Paul (lost) for the chapel of St Benedict in Santa Maria dei Servi in Pistoia, and also in 1383 he was paid for 40 torches to surround a bier."

"
2881,"LISBOA, Antonio Francisco",(1738-1814),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lisboa/biograph.html,"
Brazilian sculptor and architect, son of the Portuguese architect Manuel Francisco Lisboa (active 1728-1767). He was born in Brazil of a black slave mother.  A strange disease that caused the shriveling of his hands and feet earned him the nickname of 'o Aleijadinho' (the little cripple). He built churches (church of Sao Francisco), carved altarpieces, and created wood and stone sculptures.  He reformed the wood-carving, modifying its Baroque exuberance, and he brought a new purity to architecture by reverting to the concept of harmonious space. He was also the author of much excellent statuary in the pathetic style of the great Baroque works of the past. The polychromed wood Stations of the Cross in the sanctuary of Congonhas do Campo were carved between 1796 and 1799. The  twelve stone prophets in front of the Congonhas do Campo sanctuary are his masterpieces.

2882,"LISIEWSKA, Anna Dorothea","(b. 1721, Berlin, d. 1782, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lisiewsk/dorothea/biograph.html,"

She worked for Charles-Eugene, Count of Württemberg, in Stuttgart from 1761 to 1762, and for Charles Theodore Wittelsbach, Elector Palatine of the Rhine, in Mannheim from 1763 to 1764. In 1765 she returned, via Stuttgart and Hohenzollern-Hechingen, to Paris, where in 1767 she became a member of the Académie Royale. She met Denis Diderot and Philipp Hackert, both of whom she painted, and Charles-Nicolas Cochin (ii), but, despite consistent support from Prince Galitsyn, she was unable to establish herself in Paris."

2884,"LISS, Johann","(b. ca. 1590, Oldenburg, d. 1631, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/liss/biograph.html,"
Johann Liss (Lys), German painter, active mainly in Italy. He trained in the Netherlands (probably in Amsterdam, possibly with Goltzius) and visited Paris before moving to Italy c.1620. Venice seems to have been the main centre of his activity, but he also worked in Rome, and Caravaggesque influence is clearly seen in such vivid and strongly lit works as Judith and Holofernes. His work enjoyed considerable popularity in Venice (where there was a dearth of talented native painters at this time) and his Vision of St Jerome in the church of San Nicola da Tolentino was much copied. It shows the remarkably free brushwork and brilliant use of high-keyed colour that were the salient features of his style and which were influential on Venetian painting when its glory revived in the 18th century. It was formerly assumed that Liss, who ranks second only to Elsheimer as the most brilliant German painter of the 17th century, perished in the Venetian plague of 1629-30, but it is now known that he died in Verona in 1631.



"
2885,"LISSE, Dirck van der","(b. 1607, Breda, d. 1669, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lisse/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. He was a pupil of Cornelis van Poelenburgh c. 1630. In 1635 the Stadholder, Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange Nassau, commissioned him, along with van Poelenburgh, Abraham Bloemaert and Herman Saftleven, to paint a cycle of scenes based on Giovanni Battista Guarini's Il pastor fido for the restored hunting castle at Honselaarsdijk. In 1639 van der Lisse moved to The Hague, where he was a founder-member of the painters' confraternity Pictura in 1656; he became Burgomaster of the city in 1660.

2887,"LIXIGNOLO, Jacopo",(active 1460),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lixignol/biograph.html,"
Italian medalist. Nothing is known about the artist except that he signed two medals, both of them dated 1460. They portray Borso d'Este and an unknown person, Beata Maria Anna of Siena.



"
2888,"LLANOS, Fernando",(active 1506-1516 in Valencia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/llanos/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He and Fernando Yáñez (Yáñez de la Almedina) are first recorded in Valencia around 1506, painting in a style originating in Florentine art and the work of Leonardo da Vinci, although it is also recorded that in 1505 a Fernando Spagnuolo was receiving payment for work on the cartoon for Leonardo's Battle of Anghiari (1503-08; destroyed; copy, Florence, Uffizi). Although there is no documentary evidence to show that the two trained in Italy, it seems likely in the light of the innovations that they brought to Renaissance Valencian painting, including models derived from Leonardo, and a preference for scenes with monumental architecture in which figures are symmetrically arranged in parallel planes in the Italian manner. It is difficult to distinguish between the styles of the two artists, as the differences in their work are slight, although it seems that Yañez was the more gifted. He conceived his figures with greater monumentality, and his work was more classical and serene, painted with a greater clarity and breadth of composition than that of his colleague. The figures painted by Llanos are smaller and more restless and are sometimes unusually proportioned.



"
2889,"LLANOS VALDÉS, Sebastián de","(b. ca. 1605, Sevilla, d. 1677, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/llanos_v/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He belonged to the lesser nobility and must have possessed means sufficient for him not to have depended on income from his painting. He trained with Francisco de Herrera and had his own workshop from 1630. He was receptive to current pictorial tendencies, and his style was influenced successively by Herrera, Zurbarán, Murillo and Juan de Valdés Leal. This range of influences is reflected in his work, which is varied and uneven: while a few paintings show a careful technique, others are badly executed and of poor quality."
2890,"LOARTE, Alejandro de","(b. ca. 1597, d. 1626, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/loarte/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. The son of a painter, he was married in Madrid in 1619 but later lived and worked in Toledo, where he enjoyed a wide-ranging but short-lived career. His few extant religious paintings are mediocre, although his large, multi-figured Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes (1622; private collection) is ambitious and accomplished. His best works are still-lifes, all dating from the last four years of his life. These compositions portray objects suspended and arranged within a window-frame or on a shelf and broadly follow the format of works by Juan Sánchez Cotán and Juan van der Hamen y León, but they lack the same spatial clarity or refined sense of interval."
2891,"LOCATELLI, Andrea","(b. 1695, Roma, d. 1741, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/locatell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He received his first artistic training from his father, Giovanni Francesco Locatelli (c. 1660-1741), a little-known painter who settled in the district of Trastevere in Rome c. 1699. He then studied with Monsu Alto (d c. 1712), a painter of coastal views, few of whose works are known. After Alto's death he moved to the studio of Bernardino Fergioni (1674-c. 1738) and, lastly, to that of Biagio Puccini. His study of the human figure in the latter's studio laid the foundations of his later success as a painter of bambocciate. In 1715 he was commissioned to decorate a room in the Palazzo Ruspoli in Rome with marine scenes in gouache; he apparently painted only the figures himself and was already being paid at the rate customary for a master painter. He also decorated Prince Antonio Ottoboni's apartments in the Palazzo della Cancelleria, Rome, with landscapes (untraced), which were highly praised by Pio (1724)."

He received primary education from his father - a royal architect of the  house of Vasa - and then was trained by the architect Giovanni Battista Ghisleni (1600-1672). Further knowledge was supplemented by a stay in Rome (about 1680) and direct contacts at the Sobieski court with the leading architect Tylman van Gameren and other royal artists."

French painter. Luigi Aloys François Joseph Loir was born in Gorritz, Austria of French parents. He began his first formal art education in 1853 at the Beaux-Art Academy in Paris. Upon finishing his studies in 1865, Loir had his debut in the Salon of Paris with ""Paysage a Villiers-sur Seine"" for which he received the highest acclaim. Loir then enrolled into studies under Jean Amable Amedee Pastelot (1810-1870) to become a mural painter. He became a very popular ceiling and mural painter. One of Loir's first commissions was to paint the murals and ceilings at the Chateaux du Diable in 1866."

During his stay in Italy from 1647 to 1649, he met Nicolas Poussin in Rome, an encounter that was to have a clear influence on his painting. He was accepted as an academician in 1663 (or in 1666 according to some biographers) on the recommendation of Louis XIV and Charles Le Brun. He featured in the Salon in Paris in 1673."

He was influenced by Michelangelo and Raphael.

2898,"LOMBARD, Lambert","(b. 1505, Liege, d. 1566, Liege)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lombard/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, draughtsman, architect, humanist and numismatist. He belonged to the generation of artists who sought to revive Flemish painting by turning to the art of antiquity and the Italian Renaissance. However, because of his northern training, he assimilated his models with difficulty and produced a hesitant form of art, one that was academic and cold. He was nonetheless an important innovator in the Low Countries through his investigation of the forms and compositions of Classical art. He also founded the first academy of art in the Low Countries and was influential through the prime role he accorded to scholarship in the training of the artist. Lombard was active as a designer of prints and as an architect, and seems to have run a large workshop, particularly in his later career. He was enormously influential on the development of art in Liège in the 16th Century, and his resolutely classicizing anti-primitive taste established a tradition which lasted in Liège throughout the following century as well."

His precise contribution is debated, but he may have executed marble reliefs of mythological subjects. Vasari also mentioned that he worked in mezzo rilievo on the decoration of Sansovino's Libreria Marciana in Venice with Cattaneo, Bartolomeo Ammannati and Tommaso Lombardo (active around 1550). He may have executed the relief panels of garlands and putti for the soffits of the Library.

His youthful work included frescos in the Palazzo Sagredo which reveal his lack of talent in this field. But at about the age of 40, Longhi managed to find his own creative voice which soon made him a specialist in a highly successful new genre. Drawing on his memories of youthful studies with Giuseppe Maria Crespi (an important precursor to Longhi's brand of genre painting), he began painting small canvases on everyday subjects, showing real places and people.

Of her 15 known works, 12 are small Virgin and Child compositions, which Vasari praised for their 'purity of line and soft brilliance of colour'. Her early works are simple compositions, using a limited palette and emphasizing linearity over modelling. St Catherine of Alexandria (1589; Museo d'Arte della Città, Ravenna) was painted for the monastery of Classe in Ravenna and is probably a self-portrait of the artist."

Italian sculptor and architect. He trained in the Florentine workshop of Baccio Bandinelli from 1540. Between 1558 and 1559 he collaborated with Vincenzo de' Rossi in Rome on a statue for the monument to Paul IV (destroyed). Battista had returned to Florence by 1563, when he undertook a cycle of the Four Seasons (completed c. 1570; untraced) for the residence in Paris of the abate Giovambattista Guadagni (d 1591). In 1564, the year of his election to the Florentine Accademia del Disegno, he provided a figure of Painting for Michelangelo's catafalque and for Michelangelo's tomb in Santa Croce, Florence, the bust of Michelangelo and the figure of Sculpture (later transformed into Painting). His terracotta model for Sculpture (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) differs considerably from the final more complex and monumental figure (completed 1574)."
2938,"LORENZI, Stoldo di Gino","(b. 1534, Settignano, d. 1583, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzi/stoldo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, nephew of Battista Lorenzi. He was first apprenticed as a carver in his father's workshop and then trained as a painter with Michele Tosini in Florence. By 1550, however, he was apprenticed to the sculptor Niccolò Tribolo. Stoldo's first patron was Luca Martini (d. 1561), a poet and writer, who was the administrator of Pisa under Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Martini housed Stoldo in Pisa c. 1555-62, during which time the sculptor also received commissions from Santa Maria della Spina for an Annunciation group and from Cosimo I for a marble stemma flanked by personifications of Religion and Justice for the palazzo of the Cavalieri di Santo Stefano. His most notable work for Martini is a marble relief of Cosimo I Receiving Tribute from the Towns of Tuscany (c. 1555; Holkham Hall, Norfolk). Once thought to be by Michelangelo, the relief was commissioned as a pendant to Pierino da Vinci's Pisa restaurata (Museo Pio-Clementino, Vatican), which Stoldo completed after Pierino's death."

2940,LORENZO DI CREDI,"(b. ca. 1459, Firenze, d. 1537, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzo/credi/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter. He was a fellow pupil of Leonardo in Verrocchio's workshop and he seems to have stayed there until Verrocchio's death in 1488, managing the painting side of his master's varied business. He was a very fine craftsman, but his style was lacking in individuality."
2941,LORENZO Monaco,"(b. ca. 1370, Siena (?), d. ca. 1425, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzo/monaco/biograph.html,"
Italian painter who was probably born in Siena, but seems to have spent all his professional life in Florence. In 1391 he took his vows as a monk of the Camaldolese monastery of Sta Maria degli Angeli. He rose to the rank of deacon, but in 1402 he was enrolled in the painters' guild under his lay name, Piero di Giovanni (Lorenzo Monaco means 'Laurence the Monk'), and was living outside the monastery. The monastery was renowned for its manuscript illuminations and several miniatures in books in the Laurentian Library in Florence have been attributed to him, but he was primarily a painter of altarpieces, good examples of which are in the National Gallery in London and the Uffizi in Florence. His main works in fresco are the scenes of the Life of Mary in the Bartolini Chapel of Sta Trinità, Florence.

"
2942,LORENZO DI NICCOLÒ DI MARTINO,(active 1392-1412),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzo/niccolo/biograph.html,"
The first extant record of the artist shows that he was an associate of Niccolò di Pietro Gerini in 1392, when Gerini was working on the decoration of Francesco Datini's house in Prato. Lorenzo, often wrongly described as Gerini's son, was probably trained in his workshop, and the earliest works attributable to him have much in common with the older master's style. The commissions they completed together include the 1404 polyptych for Santa Felicità in Florence, now in the Accademia."
2943,LORENZO VENEZIANO,(active 1356-1372 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzo/venezian/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. We have little written evidence for the life of Lorenzo Veneziano, one of the most important figures in late-fourteenth-century Venice, but many of his surviving works are dated. It is likely that he worked in the workshop of Paolo Veneziano in the early 1350s and he also worked at Verona, Vicenza, and Bologna, where he executed the Lion Triptych (1357-59) for the Sant'Antonio Abate church (now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice)."
2944,LORENZO DA VITERBO,"(b. ca. 1444, Viterbo, d. 1472, Viterbo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzo/viterbo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Viterbo. He is documented in Rome by 1462 as ""Master Lorenzo di Jacopo di Pietro Paolo di Viterbo"", where he probably came into contact with Antoniazzo Romano. In 1465, he frescoed the Mazzatosta Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Verità in Viterbo. This work, the artist's only documented painting, shows his closeness to the Paduan school of painting. The frescoes were nearly destroyed during World War II, and have been painstakingly restored."
2945,LORENZETTO,"(b. 1490, Firenze, d. 1541, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorenzto/biograph.html,"
Lorenzo di Lotti, known as Lorenzetto, was a Tuscan sculptor in the circle of Raphael. He was active in Rome for some time, though Vasari judged his mysterious early activity as ""not meriting being remembered."" In 1519 he was given the important commission of the statues for the funerary chapel of Agostino Chigi in Santa Maria del Popolo. Raphael had provided the design for the statues, but Lorenzetto gave them a delicate, vibrant interpretation, with great skill and chiaroscuro softness. Lorenzetto produced the Madonna del Sasso for Raphael's tomb in the Pantheon, with the collaboration of Raffaele da Montelupo. The almost simultaneous death of Chigi and Raphael (the wealthy patron died in 1520 only four days after Raphael) heralded the decline in Lorenzetto's fortune. Clement VII gave him an important commission, the St Peter for Ponte Sant'Angelo and the pendant of Paolo Taccone's fifteenth-century St Paul. "
2946,"LORME, Anthonie de","(b. ca. 1610, Tournai, d. 1673, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lorme/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, specialized in church interiors and painted mostly in Rotterdam. His earliest known picture, a small panel signed and dated 1639, shows a coffered barrel vault reflecting candlelight in Rotterdam's Laurenskerk. His imaginary interiors of the 1640s often betrayed an enthusiasm for flashy effects like candlelit vaults and pools of shade thrown by glowing chandeliers."
2947,"LOSSON, Anton",(active 1670s in Mechelen),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/losson/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect, active in Mechelen. He was a Jesuit brother trained as architect. He was responsible for the design of the Sint-Pieters-en-Pauluskerk in Mechelen.

"
2949,"LOTSCH, Johann Christian","(b. 1790, Karlsruhe, d. 1873, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lotsch/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, active in Italy. He trained as a painter and a sculptor before moving from Karlsruhe to Rome in 1818. There he made sought-after works on paper which satirised life in the Eternal City by grotesquely caricaturing its inhabitants and, at the same time, created some of the most refined and lucidly composed Romantic marble carvings of the first half of the 19th century."
2950,"LOTTER, Hieronymus","(b. 1497, Nürnberg, d. 1580, Geyer)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lotter/biograph.html,"
Hieronymus Lotter was a merchant and mayor of Leipzig several times, chief engineer of important sovereign construction projects in Saxony, driving force in Leipzig for extensive construction of the council. Lotter worked as a master builder of Duke Moritz of Saxony under the direction master builder Caspar Voigt von Wierandt (d. 1560). Formerly he was considered a major architect of the Renaissance, today, his role is seen more differentiated and above all his organizational function is emphasized.



"
2951,"LOTTO, Lorenzo","(b. 1480, Venezia, d. 1556, Loreto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lotto/biograph.html,"Italian painter. He was born in Venice, and his early work has a decidedly crisp and clear character that shows the influence of the Venetian painters Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, although it also reflects the lyricism of Giorgione and, in the treatment of landscape, the influence of German painters and printmakers, notably Albrecht Dürer.
"
2952,"LOTZ, Károly","(b. 1833, Homburg vor der Höhe, d. 1904, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lotz/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. Lotz was one of the greatest Hungarian academic painters in the style of Historicism. He started his studies at the Viennese private school of Carl Rahl in 1852; later he worked for Rahl by drawing his preliminary cartoons. Between 1855 and 1870 Lotz painted his panneaux in a characteristically romantic style. The female portraits and nudes painted between 1855 and 1879 show the stylistic traits of lyrical realism and fine naturalism."
2953,"LOUIS, Victor","(b. 1731, Paris, d. ca. 1800, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/louis/biograph.html,"
French architect and designer. He changed his birth name ""Louis-Nicolas Louis"" to ""Victor Louis"". He was a student of Louis Adam from 1748. In 1755 he won the ""Grand Prix"", or more precisely a special ""Premier Prix extraordinaire hors concours"" as his final design did not agree with his esquisse."
2954,"LOUTHERBOURG, Philip Jacques de","(b. 1740, Strasbourg, d. 1812, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/loutherb/biograph.html,"
Alsatian painter, illustrator and stage designer, active in France and England. Loutherbourg's father, Philipp Jakob (1698-1768), was an engraver and miniature painter to the court of Darmstadt. In 1755 he took his family to Paris, where Loutherbourg became a pupil of Carle Van Loo; he also attended Jean-Georges Wille's engraving academy in the Quai des Augustins and Francesco Casanova's studio. Wille directed Loutherbourg's attention to 17th-century Dutch landscape artists, such as Philips Wouwerman and Nicolaes Berchem, and in 1763 Denis Diderot noticed the inspiration of the latter in Loutherbourg's first Salon exhibit, a landscape with figures (Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery). In this and other works, focus is on the foreground figures, which are framed by natural formations that occasionally fall away to reveal distant horizons. This informal style found favour with the French public; Loutherbourg's vivid, fresh colour and ability to catch specific light and weather conditions made the pastoral subjects of François Boucher and his school seem contrived and fey. Rather more romanticized were Loutherbourg's shipwreck scenes (e.g. A Shipwreck, exh. Salon 1767; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum), inspired by Claude-Joseph Vernet, and pictures of banditti recalling Salvator Rosa. Loutherbourg became the most prolific painter to exhibit at the Salon between 1762 and 1771. In 1766 he was elected to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and nominated as a Peintre du Roi.



"
2955,"LOVISA, Domenico","(b. ca. 1690, Venezia, d. ca. 1750, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lovisa/biograph.html,"
Italian publisher. His printing press was situated 'underneath the arches at Rialto' in Venice, and he is known almost exclusively for the publication of a series of large prints, titled Il Gran Teatro di Venezia ovvero descrizione esatta di cento delle piu` insigni prospettive e di altretante celebri pitture della medesima citta`. The first edition is undated, but it probably came out c. 1717. As originally planned, the series was to include 200 prints, but this ambition was not realized, and even the second edition (1720, 2 vols) has only c. 120 prints. The approximately 57 plates contained in the first volume reproduce paintings that hung in Venetian public buildings, including works by Veronese, Titian, Tintoretto, Palma Giovane. They were engraved by Andrea Zucchi, Domenico Rossetti (1650-1736), Giacomo Burri, Domenico Bonavera (b 1640), Pietro Sante Bartoli, Agostino dalla Via and others. The second volume contains a varying number (up to 66) of views of Venice engraved by Filippo Vasconi (1687-1730), Giuseppe Valeriani (d 1761), Carlo and Andrea Zucchi, as well as an unidentified monogrammist, S.F. This series was reprinted a number of times in the 18th century.



"
2956,"LOYET, Gerard",(active 1466-1502),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/loyet/biograph.html,"
South Netherlandish goldsmith. He is cited as goldsmith and 'varlet de chambre' to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (reg 1433-77). Among Loyet's works for the Duke were images presented to churches, one of which survives: a gold, silver and enamel reliquary representing the kneeling Duke accompanied by St George, completed in 1466-67 and donated to St Lambert's Cathedral, Liège (in situ), in 1471. This delicate reliquary, conceived as a votive group, provides some idea of more imposing works (all untraced), including two life-size silver statues of Charles and two portrait busts, the former for the churches in Aardenburg and Scheut (near Brussels), the latter for churches in Geeraardsbergen and Linkebeek, listed in payments of 1477.



"
2957,LUCA DI TOMMÈ,(active 1356–1389 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luca/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He worked in Siena in the second half of the 14th century and was one of the generation of artists who inherited and upheld the conventions of Duccio, Simone Martini and Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. While he was not an innovator, his extensive output helped to sustain the decorative Sienese style that was to survive well into the 15th century. Over 50 works have been attributed to him, mostly altarpieces, although it is not always possible to distinguish his hand. Documentary and inscriptional evidence shows that he was a prolific and respected artist. One of his main patrons was the Opera del Duomo, the authorities of Siena Cathedral, for which he also acted as a consultant. In style his works developed from an early, more imitative mode to a distinctive interpretation of the relationship between figures and their backgrounds, with a growing interest in line, ornament and texture.



"
2958,"LUCAS DE MONTIGNY, Jean-Robert-Nicolas","(b. 1747, Rouen, d. 1810, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lucasmon/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He trained with Jean-Baptiste Pigalle and also from 1773 at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, Paris, but, despite his undoubted talents as a sculptor, he never became an academician. In 1777 he set up on his own in Paris and was soon in fashionable demand, producing portraits such as that of Mlle d'Oligny (terracotta, 1778; Musée Cognacq-Jay, Paris). Portraits of actors, such as his bust of Préville as Figaro (patinated plaster, 1782) or the statuette of Mme de Saint-Huberty as Dido (plaster, 1784; both Musée du Louvre, Paris), show a responsive delicacy, but the uncompromising realism of his portraiture is seen at its best in the powerful busts of his patron Honoré Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, whom he sculpted in plaster in 1781 and 1790 (private collections) and in marble in 1791 (Musée Arbaud, Aix-en-Provence)."
2959,"LUCAS VELÁZQUEZ, Eugenio","(b. 1824, Alcalé de Henares, d. 1870, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lucasvel/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was long known as Lucas Padilla, but research has shown that his real surname was Lucas Velázquez. He came late to painting, in 1844 still stating his profession as that of cabinetmaker. It is possible that he studied at the Academia de San Fernando in Madrid, but he may have been largely self-taught. His early work included portraits (e.g. Jenaro Peréz Villaamil, 1849; Madrid, Museo Romántico), scenes of the Spanish Inquisition and subjects from contemporary life (e.g. Scene with Bandits, 1855; Madrid, Museo Romántico)."
2960,"LUCE, Maximilien","(b. 1858, Paris, 1941, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luce/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He was born and brought up in the working-class surroundings of Montparnasse, and an interest in the daily routines and labours of the petit peuple of Paris informs much of his art. After an apprenticeship with the wood-engraver Henri Théophile Hildebrand (b 1824), in 1876 he entered the studio of the wood-engraver Eugène Froment where he assisted in the production of engravings for various French and foreign publications such as L'Illustration and The Graphic. He also sporadically attended classes at the Académie Suisse and in the studio of Carolus-Duran. In Froment's studio he came into contact with the artists Léo Gausson and Emile-Gustave Peduzzi (Cavallo-Peduzzi; 1851-1917) and in their company began painting landscape subjects in and around the town of Lagny-sur-Marne."
2961,"LUCE, Lucas","(b. ca. 1576, Antwerpen, d. 1661, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luce_l/biograph.html,"
Lucas Luce (or Lusse), Dutch painter and art dealer. He worked in Amsterdam for most of his long career.  His output was varied; in addition to still-lifes, he produced portraits (one painted when he was 81 year old), and there is a genre scene in a tavern in the collection of the Hallwyl Museum, Stockholm.



"
2962,"LUCHIAN, ªtefan","(b. 1868, Stefanesti, d. 1916, Bucureºti)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luchian/biograph.html,"
Romanian painter. He studied at the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest, graduating in 1889 and continuing his studies at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich and in Paris at the Académie Julian, where he was a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He rejected the rigidity of academic painting early in his career, however. The Last Autumn Race (1892; Bucharest, Museum of Arts), one of the few paintings known from this period, clearly illustrates the influence of Manet and Impressionism on his early work."
2963,"LUINI, Bernardino","(b. 1480, Luino, d. 1532, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luini/father/biograph.html,"
Milanese painter, one of the most prominent of Leonardo's followers in Lombardy. Little is known of his life, but his prolific output indicates that he must have enjoyed a successful career (he was unusual among Leonardo's followers in that he painted numerous frescos as well as easel pictures)."
2964,"LUINI, Aurelio","(b. ca. 1530, Luino, d. 1593, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luini/son/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of Bernardino Luini. He joined with Giovan Paolo Lomazzo and other artists to found the satirical Accademia della Val di Blenio  in 1560. The common interest in an anticlassical, anti-Mannerist style shared by the artists of the academy led them to seek a powerful naturalistic immediacy in their paintings. Perhaps before anyone else, Aurelio Luini returned to the rich corpus of Leonardesque drawings to restudy anatomy. Luini also revived two practices strongly favoured by Leonardo himself, drawing from life and using a variety of models.



"
2965,"LUND, Johan Ludwig Gebhard","(b. 1777, Kiel, d. 1867, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lund/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He came to Copenhagen to train as an artist, and in 1797, at the age of 22, he started his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. He came quickly into contact with the rich and powerful of that time, which had a decided influence on his artistic development. He studied under Neoclassicist Nikolai Abildgaard at the Academy from 1797-99, and taught drawing privately during his student years. He received the Academy's small silver medallion in 1798 and the large silver medallion in 1799, but never competed for the gold medallion."
2966,"LUNDBERG, Gustaf","(b. 1695, Stockholm, d. 1786, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lundberg/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter and pastellist. He was orphaned early and brought up by his grandfather, the goldsmith Fredrik Richter (1636-1714). In 1710 he was briefly apprenticed to David von Krafft (1655-1724). Against von Krafft's advice, and at his own expense, he travelled to Paris in 1717. He studied first with Hyacinthe Rigaud, Nicolas de Largillierre and Jean-François de Troy, learning to paint in a Régence style less heavy and serious than that taught by von Krafft in Sweden. He also studied drawing under Pierre-Jacques Cazes at the École des Beaux-Arts."
2967,"LUNDBYE, Johan Thomas","(b. 1818, Kalundborg, d. 1848, Bedsted)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lundbye/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, where he finished in 1842. He began exhibiting in 1835. In the years to come he would focus his painting on depicting landscapes."
2968,"LUNY, Thomas","(b. 1759, Cornwall, d. 1837, Teignmouth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luny/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was a member of the Thames group of marine painters around Deptford, following the tradition of the van de Velde family, Dutch 17th-century marine painters. Luny was a pupil of Francis Holman (active 1760-1790) by 1773 and first exhibited in 1777 at the Society of Artists, showing Storm and Shipwreck (untraced). He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1780 until 1793 and then only in 1802 and in the year of his death. His absence from the Academy exhibitions after 1793 gave rise to the erroneous assumption of his enlistment in the navy during the Napoleonic conflict, but there is no mention of Luny in Admiralty records.



"
2969,"LUTI, Benedetto","(b. 1666, Firenze, d. 1724, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman, collector, dealer and teacher. He was one of the most significant and influential artists active in Rome in the first quarter of the 18th century. The son of a Florentine artisan, he trained in his native city under the direction of Anton Domenico Gabbiani and thoroughly absorbed the style of Pietro da Cortona and his late Baroque successors. In 1690 he left Florence for Rome, where in 1692 he made his artistic début in the annual St Bartholomew's Day exhibition with a monumental painting of God Cursing Cain after the Murder of Abel (Kedleston Hall, Derbys). He quickly rose to prominence and in 1694 was elected to the Accademia di S Luca."
2970,"LUTMA, Johannes the Elder","(b. 1587, Emden, 1669, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lutma/elder/biograph.html,"
Dutch silver- and goldsmith. He was born in the German town of Emden, around 1615 he was living in Paris. In 1621 he settled permanently in Amsterdam, where he married two years later. He was a friend of Rembrandt, who etched his portrait. He has wrongly been thought to have been a pupil of the goldsmith Paulus van Vianen. He is best known for the choir-screen in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam (etched by Johannes the Younger), and his designs for zoomorphic ornaments. This 'auricular' style was briefly influential among a small group of artists in the Netherlands, Germany, and possibly Denmark."
2971,"LUTMA, Johannes the Younger","(b. 1624, Amsterdam, d. 1689, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lutma/younger/biograph.html,"
Dutch printmaker, gold- and silversmith and draughtsman, son of Johannes Lutma the Elder. He became a master in 1643. In 1651 he was in Rome, where he made drawings (e.g. the Farnese Hercules, 1651; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) and engraved several fountains (e.g. the engraving of the fountain in Piazza Navona, 1652). In the etched portrait of his father (1656) Johannes the Younger began to exploit tonal effects through the additional use of punch and roulette. In the later hammered or punched prints of c. 1681 he managed to produce quite exceptional grey tones by a combination of roulette accents in the outlines and fine punching.

2972,"LUTTICHUIJS, Isaac","(b. 1616, London, d. 1673, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luttichu/isaac/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, brother of Simon Luttichuijs. The brothers were sons of Dutch parents and born in London. They moved at a young age to Amsterdam where they studied. Isaac began his career as a still-life painter working in the studio of his elder brother Simon but soon turned to portraiture, developing a style influenced by van Dyck and, after 1638 on settling in Amsterdam, by the portraits of Bartholomeus van der Helst."
2973,"LUTTICHUIJS, Simon","(b. 1610, London, d. 1661, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luttichu/simon/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, brother of Isaac Luttichuijs. Born in London, the brothers soon moved to Amsterdam where they studied. Simon specialised in still-lifes, Isaac painted mainly portraits."

Frans Luyckx (also spelt Luycx, Lux, Leux) was a Flemish painter. He entered the St Luke painters' society in Antwerp and was an associate of Rubens. In 1635 he went to Italy, and in 1638 he was named painter for Emperor Ferdinand III in Prague. After the death of the emperor, his successor Leopold Wilhelm confirmed Luyckx in his post, and in 1657 he went to the court in Vienna. "
2975,"LUYCKX, Christiaen","(b. 1623, Antwerpen, d. after 1657)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/luyckx_c/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. One of the most accomplished seventeenth-century Flemish still-life painters, Christiaen Luyckx remains overshadowed by some of his contemporaries. Many of his works have long passed under the names of other artists, such as Jan Davidsz. de Heem."
2976,"LYMING, Robert",(ca. 1558-1628),https://www.wga.hu/bio/l/lyming/biograph.html,"
English carpenter and architect. His earliest record of employment is dated 1607 at the almshouses at Theobalds in Hertfordshire. From 1607-12 he was in charge of the design and construction of Hatfield House for Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In 1616-17 Lyming was designing Blickling Hall in Norfolk for Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet."

Dutch painter, draughtsman and engraver. He was a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem and Hendrick Mommers. He entered the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1678, later moving to The Hague, where he entered the Guild in 1697. He accompanied William III, Prince of Orange Nassau, to England and joined him on his Irish campaign. A large drawing of the Battle of the Boyne, signed and dated 1 July 1690 (Windsor Castle, Royal Library), served as the basis for an unknown number of paintings. He also made two engravings of the battle."
2978,"MACCARI, Cesare","(b. 1840, Siena, d. 1919, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maccari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied decoration at the Istituto d'Arte in Siena and also observed the sculptor Tito Sarrocchi (1824-1900) at work in his studio. Maccari became a friend of Luigi Mussini (1813-1888) and Alessandro Franchi (1838-1914), and he decided to devote himself to painting. On winning a scholarship, he studied in Rome. He achieved success with Fabiola (Collection Chigi-Saracini, Siena) and afterwards he worked on the decoration of the church of the Sudario.

Bernardino Maccaruzzi (also Barnardo Maccarucci), Italian architect. He was a pupil of Giorgio Massari, but most of his work in the declining Republic was merely in reconstructions and restorations. He helped build the façade of the church of San Rocco (1765-71) and of the Scuola della Carità (1766, design by Massari, now the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice); he worked in the Palazzo del Ridotto (1768) and one of the banquet rooms in the Palazzo Ducale. In Mestre, he designed the construction of the Chiesa Collegiata. In Padua, he helped build the Palazzo del Capitanio (1779)."
2980,"MACCHIETTI, Girolamo","(b. ca. 1535, ?, d. 1592, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/macchiet/biograph.html,"
Girolamo di Francesco di Mariotto Macchietti (Girolamo del Crocifissaio), Italian Mannerist painter. He trained in Florence with Michele Tosini, whose studio he left c. 1556 to work for six years under Vasari on the redecoration of the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence; there he was apparently employed as a designer of tapestries. This was followed by two years of study in Rome. By 1563 he had returned to Florence, where he became a member of the newly founded Accademia del Disegno. Under the academy's auspices he collaborated in 1564 with his friend Mirabello Cavalori on a grisaille painting of Lorenzo de' Medici Receiving Michelangelo (untraced) for the catafalque of Michelangelo's funeral in S Lorenzo, Florence. For the academy's next major project, the decorations for Duke Francesco I de' Medici's wedding in 1565 to Joanna of Austria (1547-78), Macchietti contributed a monochrome painting of the Establishment of the Monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore (untraced) towards a festive ‘Arch of Religion'."
2981,"MACDONALD, Lawrence","(b. 1799, Bonnyview, Findo Gask, d. 1878, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/macdonal/biograph.html,"

Joaquim Machado de Castro was the most important Portuguese sculptor during the second half of the 18th century. He came from Coimbra, the old university town on the Mondego, and spent time at the school for sculptors founded by King Joaô in Mafra, north-west of Lisbon. Machado de Castro was known best of all for his highly vivid Christmas crib scenes, examples of which are in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, the Sé Patriarcal Cathedral and the Basílica da Estrêla in Lisbon. During the rebuilding of Lisbon after the earthquake of 1755, Machado de Castro designed the equestrian statue of King José I on the Praça do Comércio.



"
2983,"MACHUCA, Pedro","(b. 1490/95, Toledo, d. 1550, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/machuca/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect and painter, active mainly in Granada. He worked in Italy in his early career (which is ill documented) and was one of the first Spanish artists to break entirely with medieval tradition and show a full understanding of Renaissance ideals. His earliest dated work, The Virgin with the Souls of Purgatory (Prado, Madrid, 1517), was painted in Italy and is thoroughly Raphaelesque in style."
2984,"MACHY, Pierre-Antoine de","(b. 1723, Paris, d. 1807, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/machy/biograph.html,"
French painter and engraver. He was the son of a cabinetmaker and served his apprenticeship with Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture, Paris, in 1755 and was received (reçu) three years later as a painter of architecture. He exhibited regularly at the Salon from 1757 to 1802. His views of the interiors of the Paris churches of Ste Geneviève and the Madeleine were painted from architectural plans and exhibited at the Salons of 1761 and 1763 respectively, earning Diderot's praise. At the Salon of 1763 de Machy also demonstrated his talent for painting contemporary events with a pair of pictures of the Foire Saint-Germain after the fire of 1762 (both Paris, Carnavalet) and a scene of the Installation of Bouchardon's Statue of Louis XV (untraced), with the statue being placed on its pedestal in the Place Louis XV (now the Place de la Concorde)."
2985,"MACLISE, Daniel","(b. 1806, Cork, d. 1870, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maclise/biograph.html,"
Irish painter and caricaturist, active in London from 1827. An outstanding draughtsman, Maclise became the leading history painter of his period, his greatest works being two enormous murals in the House of Lords on The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher at Waterloo (completed 1861) and The Death of Nelson at Trafalgar (completed 1865). They were done in the water-glass technique and are poorly preserved (a sketch for the Nelson in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool gives an idea of the original colouring), but they are powerful works - fully coherent in spite of the huge numbers of figures involved - and they remain the most stirring examples of his heroic powers of design."
2986,MACRINO D'ALBA,"(b. ca. 1462, Alba, d. ca. 1515, Alba)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/macrino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His birth name was Gian Giacomo de' Alladio and was nicknamed 'Macrino' probably because of his slim and gaunt build. He was also known as Gian Giacomo de Fava. He was a descendant of a family with some social status in Alba. He was active mainly in Piedmont, and is known for his altarpieces and portraits."

Scottish painter. His love of the sea began in his childhood, spent on the west coast of Scotland. An aptitude for portrait painting led him to Edinburgh in 1852 where he became one of a brilliant generation of students under Robert Scott Lauder at the Trustees' Academy. In 1857 he visited the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, seeing paintings by the Old Masters and by Constable and Turner, for both of whom he had a lifelong admiration. His naturalistic style was influenced by the English Pre-Raphaelites whom he met in Manchester."
2988,"MADARÁSZ, Viktor","(b. 1830, Csetnek, d. 1917, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/madarasz/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He was a private soldier first, then a lieutenant in the war of independence fought against the Hapsburgs in 1848-49 which was a major experience for him all through his life. He dedicated his art to the idea of independence and recalled the heroic and tragic memories of Hungarian history. After the war of independence had been defeated, he lived in exile, then took up law which he soon gave up for painting. He studied historic painting at the Vienna Academy in 1853-55.

He has long been considered a Lombard, but his death certificate gives Palestrina (30 km from Rome) as his place of birth. He was one of the outstanding sculptors in Rome in the early 17th century, and his work, together with that of such sculptors as Pietro Bernini, Nicolas Cordier, Camillo Mariani and Francesco Mochi, is generally considered to mark a transition from the late Renaissance (or Mannerist) style to the early Baroque.

Belgian painter and lithographer. He studied at the Brussels Academy of Fine Arts and was a pupil of Joseph François. While draughtsman to the topographical military division at Courtrai, he received a commission for lithographic work from a Brussels publisher. It was about 1820 that he began his artistic career. Between 1825 and 1827 he contributed to Les Vues pittoresques de la Belgique, to a Life of Napoleon, and to works on the costumes of the Netherlands, and later made a great reputation by his work in The Physiognomy of Society in Europe from 1400 to the Present Day (1836) and Life of the Painters of the Flemish and Dutch School (1842)."
2992,"MADRASSI, Luca","(b. 1848, Tricesimo, d. 1916, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/madrassi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He studied in Rome and Paris. He moved to France at a young age and quickly settled in France and took French citizenship. He studied under Jules Cavelier at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later worked in the studio of Émile-Antoine Bourdelle. In joining Carrier-Belleuse's studio he was exposed to finely conceived compositions of mythological and poetic female figures, which would later be echoed in his oeuvre. He was also a primary assistant to Ronald Gower (1845-1916) and the Gower Memorial."
2993,"MAELLA, Mariano Salvador de","(b. 1739, Valencia, d. 1819, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maella/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, son of the painter Mariano Maella who was his first teacher. He moved to Madrid, where he studied sculpture with Felipe de Castro in Madrid who introduced the Neoclassical taste to the Hispanic sculpture. In 1752, he enters the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, where he is in the service of Antonio González Velázquez, the painting teacher of the institution. This relationship will lead the marriage with his daughter, Maria González Velázquez some years later, in 1767. In 1757 he made a trip to America, then in the beginning of 1758 he went to Rome. At about 1764 he returned to Madrid and started a professional career."
2994,"MAES, Nicolaes","(b. 1634, Dordrecht, d. 1693, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maes/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. In about 1648 he became a pupil of Rembrandt in Amsterdam, staying there until 1654 when he returned to his native town Dordrecht. In his early years he concentrated on genre pictures, rather sentimental in approach, but distinguished by deep glowing colours he had learnt from his master. Old women sleeping, praying, or reading the Bible were subjects he particularly favoured."
2995,"MAESTRI, Michelangelo","(b. ca. 1779, Roma, d. 1812, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maestri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His finest compositions are based on motifs from antique frescos discovered in Pompeii and Herculaneum and from designs by Raphael or his pupil Giulio Romano. His work became very popular and often purchased by European travelers during their Grand Tour. Some of his most famous gouaches portray putti leading animals on a chariot and were inspired by ceiling frescoes in the salone of Villa Lante, on the Janiculum Hill in Rome.

Italian painter. He studied with Giovan Gioseffo dal Sole, but was also influenced by the seventeenth century Lombard painting (Our Lady of the Rosary, Varese, San Vittore). Subsequently he was affected by Venetian painting (e.g. Martyrdom of Saints Quirico and Giuditta, c. 1735, in Pavia, oratory Mezzabarba Palace).

Italian architect, active in south Bohemia and Moravia. He reconstructed the castles of the Rozmberk dynasty at Cesky Krumlov, where in 1580 he introduced an arcaded gallery into the great 13th-century tower, and Bechyne, to which he added a hall and new wings around a courtyard (1580-84). He was probably responsible for the Renaissance dwellings and a terrace (1581) added to the medieval fortress of Helfstejn in eastern Moravia. At Cesky Krumlov he built the dormitory of the Jesuit College (1586-88) to a design by P. Alexander, and he built and decorated the villa of Kurzweil (now Kratochvíle; 1580-89; with Antonio Melana) for Vilém Rozmberk (d 1592) in a symmetrical ensemble with a chapel and a garden unusual at that time in central Europe, possibly influenced by the Neugebäude in Vienna."
3000,"MAGGIORE, Giovanni Ambrogio","(b. ca. 1550, Milano, d. after 1598, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maggiore/biograph.html,"
Italian turner of ivory and wood. He or his brother, Dionigi Maggiore, with whom he worked for a while, succeeded in making a rotary lathe that was capable of producing not only the usual round turnings but also oblique forms. Little is known of the early stages of this invention; possibly the brothers based it on a project (now untraced) by Leonardo da Vinci. In 1573 a Milanese art dealer, Prospero Visconti, brought Maggiore to the attention of Crown Prince William, later William V, Duke of Bavaria (reg. 1579-98), as an 'insignis faber' (noted craftsman) who knew how to turn oval frames. The Prince, who was interested in the discovery, brought Maggiore to Bavaria to work and to teach the new technique."
3001,"MAGGIOTTO, Domenico","(b. 1712, Venezia, d. 1794, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maggiott/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters. Domenico Maggiotto belonged to the group of 18th-century Venetian artists centred round Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, whose influential late Baroque style was based more on the effects of chiaroscuro than on colour. Domenico's son Francesco Maggiotto (1738-1805) was also a painter, although of lesser importance than his father."
3002,"MAGINI, Carlo","(b. 1720, Fano, d. 1806, Fano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/magini/biograph.html,"
Carlo Magini was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He painted still-lifes in a style reminiscent of Spanish bodegón paintings."
3003,"MAGNASCO, Alessandro","(b. 1667, Genova, d. 1749, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/magnasco/biograph.html,"Italian painter, called Il Lissandrino. He was born and died in Genoa, but spent most of his working life in Milan. Son of a minor Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco trained in his home town before moving to Milan when he was still young. There he worked for many years in Filippo Abbiati's studio. His meeting with Sebastiano Ricci marked a turning-point in his art. Their acquaintance was renewed during a stay in Florence (1703-09) at the court of Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany.

Italian sculptor and architect in Florence, part of a family of artists. The brothers Giuliano da Maiano, Giovanni da Maiano I (1439-1478) and Benedetto da Maiano ran one of the most versatile and productive workshops in Florence in the later 15th century. They were sons of the mason Leonardo d'Antonio da Maiano and were brought up in the quarry village of Maiano, outside Florence. Giuliano was the administrative head of the workshop, which produced secular and ecclesiastical furniture and executed sculpture in a wide variety of media, as well as designing and building numerous architectural projects. They worked throughout Tuscany and also in Naples. Giovanni I is mentioned in payments (1473–77) for work at Santissima Annunziata, Florence, but nothing is known of his specific contribution to the family's enterprises. Giovanni da Maiano II (c. 1486-c. 1542) was the son of Benedetto da Maiano and was one of the first generation of Italian sculptors to introduce the Renaissance style to the English court at the time of Henry VIII."

3009,"MAILLE, Michel",(active 1657-1703 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maille/biograph.html,"
French sculptor active in Rome as Michele Maglia. Between the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Roman artistic environment saw the emergence of a small group of French sculptors who perfected, after having assimilated, the Baroque lessons of Bernini. Among these, Michel Maille initially trained as an ivory carver and later became student of Ercole Ferrata. He translated these experiences into works of great expressive intensity, such as that seen in the chapel of San Pietro d'Alcantara in Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome, considered his best work. This expressive intensity is also visible in the statue of Religion from the funeral monument of Carlo Bonelli at Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.



"
3010,"MAILLET, Jacques-Léonard","(b. 1823, Paris, d. 1895, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maillet/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. His themes were of neoclassical and biblical inspiration; his public commissions were in large part for the programs of decorative architectural sculpture required by the grandiose public works programs characteristic of the Second Empire, which included commemorative portraits of French culture heroes. He also provided models for goldsmith's work."
3011,"MAINARDI, Bastiano","(b. 1466, San Gimignano, d. 1513, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mainardi/biograph.html,"
Bastiano (Sebastiano) Mainardi, Italian painter, the brother-in-law of Domenico Ghirlandaio.

3012,"MAINERI, Gian Francesco","(b. ca. 1460, Parma, d. ca. 1535, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maineri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He may have gained his early training from his father who was also a painter. He studied in the workshop of Ercole de' Roberti, and was closely connected to the Este Court in Ferrara, completing many commissions including religious paintings and court portraits."
3013,"MAINI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1690, Cassano Magnago, d. 1752, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maini/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active mainly in Rome. He was born in Lombardy, but he may have had contacts with Foggini in Florence. By 1708, he had moved to Rome where he joined the large studio of Camillo Rusconi, where he worked for over twenty years. Among his first commission was the execution in bassorilievo (relief) of the Glory of San Francesco for a Jesuit church of Madrid; however, the bassorilievo in stucco, likely originally a design by Rusconi, was never sculpted in marble. Like Rusconi, Maini always modelled his projects in stucco first."
3014,"MAINO, Fray Juan Bautista","(b. 1581, Pastrana, d. 1649, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maino/biograph.html,"
Juan Bautista Maino (or Mayno), Spanish painter. He was born in Pastrana (Guadalajara), the son of a Milanese father and Portuguese mother, who was in the service of the princess of Eboli. There is a tradition that he was a pupil of El Greco in Toledo, but there is no suggestion of this in Maino's clear and firm style, which was formed in Italy c. 1600-10. Knowledge of Maino's stay in Italy is based on the brief mention of a seventeenth-century writer, who refers to him as a disciple of Annibale Carracci and friend of Guido Reni, which, if accurate, would date his Roman sojourn to the first five or six years of the century. Around 1608 or 1609, Maino had returned to his native town, where he painted a Trinity for a lateral altar in the church of the Franciscanas Concepcionistas, a work that lends credibility to his putative friendship with Guido Reni."
3015,"MAINO, Giovanni Angelo del","(b. ca. 1475, d. ca. 1536, Pavia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maino_g/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Angelo del Maino was an Italian sculptor, son of Giacomo del Maino, a master woodcarver, who directed one of the most important workshops in Milan. He worked in the family workshop together with his brother Tiburzio, and he gained expertise in carving choir stalls, architectural structures and statues for altars, crucifixes, etc."
3016,MAIR von Landshut,(active 1485-1510 in Bavaria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mair/biograph.html,"
German painter, draftsman, and engraver. The signature Mair appears on all but one of his twenty-two engravings and on one of three woodcuts. The rest of his posthumously acquired name derives from the Landshut coat of arms on the engraving Hour of Death (1499), which presumably indicates that Mair was working there. Nine other engravings are dated the same year, the only date to appear on any of his engraved work. None of Mair's other dated works is earlier than 1495 or later than 1504, years in which he was also associated with Munich and Freising. Stylistic evidence suggesting he assisted Jan Polack c. 1490 in painting an altarpiece for St Peter in Munich tallies with an entry in the Munich tax records from 1490 that lists a 'Mair Maler von Freising'. In 1495 he executed a lunette panel with scenes from the Life of Christ for the sacristy of Freising Cathedral. He may also have worked temporarily in northern Italy, producing an Ecce homo (1502; Trent Castle) and two scenes of a martyrdom (Milan, Museo Poldi Pezzoli)."
3017,"MAITANI, Lorenzo","(b. ca. 1255, Siena, d. 1330, Orvieto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maitani/biograph.html,"

3018,"MAITLAND, Paul","(b. 1863, London, d. 1909, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maitland/biograph.html,"
English landscape painter, mainly of Kensington Gardens and the Chelsea Embankment in London, where he lived. He studied at the Royal College of Art and under Theodore Roussel. He was influenced by Whistler and in 1889 was one of the 'London Impressionists' with Sickert, Steer, and others. Exhibited in London at the Baillie, Paterson, Goupil and Grafton Galleries, also in Glasgow, Paris, Munich and Dresden. He was Art Examiner for the Board of Education in 1893-1908. As a hunchback, he lived a secluded life.



"
3019,"MAKART, Hans","(b. 1840, Salzburg, d. 1884, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/makart/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied (1860-65) at the Akademie in Munich under the history painter Karl Theodor von Piloty whose influence is evident in Makart's Death of Pappenheim (1861; Vienna, Historisches Museum). Makart visited London and Paris in 1862 and Rome in 1863. The Papal Election (1863-65; Munich, Neue Pinakothek) reveals Makart's skill in the bold use of colour to convey drama as well as his virtuoso draughtsmanship. Two decorative triptychs, Modern Cupids (1868; Vienna, Zentsparkasse), and the Plague in Florence (1868; private collection), brought Makart both fame and disapproval (mostly because they lacked a literary original) when exhibited in Munich in 1868. His plan for the second work (c. 1868; St Gall, Kunstmuseum) shows a setting of sombre magnificence."
3020,"MAKOVSKY, Aleksandr Vladimirovich","(b. 1869, Moscow, d. 1924, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/makovsky/aleksand/biograph.html,"
Russian painter, part of a family of artists, son of Vladimir Makovsky. From 1894-95 he studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts at St. Petersburg. He also studied in Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. During the 1890's he was part of the Wanderers Movement from 1902, having begun exhibiting with them since 1899. The Wanderers (Itinerants) were a group of Russian realist artists who in protest at academic restrictions formed an artists' cooperative; it evolved into the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions in 1870."
3021,"MAKOVSKY, Konstantin Yegorovich","(b. 1839, Moscow, d. 1915, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/makovsky/konstant/biograph.html,"
Russian painter, part of a family of artists. He was the son of the painter and collector Yegor Ivanovich Makovsky (1800-1886), who was one of the founders of the Moscow Art School. Konstantin had two brothers, Nikolai and Vladimir, and one sister, Alexandra, who were famous painters themselves."
3022,"MAKOVSKY, Vladimir Yegorovich","(b. 1846, Moscow, d. 1920, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/makovsky/vladimir/biograph.html,"
Russian painter, part of a family of artists. He was the son of the painter and collector Yegor Ivanovich Makovsky (1800-1886), who was one of the founders of the Moscow Art School. Vladimir had two brothers, Nikolai and Konstantin, and one sister, Alexandra, who were famous painters themselves.  His son Aleksandr was also painter."
3023,"MALER, Hans","(b. ca. 1480, Ulm, d. ca. 1529, Schwaz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maler/biograph.html,"
German painter. Hans Maler often signed his name Hans Maler zu Schwaz, from his home of Schwaz in the city of Tyrol, Austria. This was near the capital city of Innsbruck, where the Habsburg Court reined, under Ferdinand I (1503-1564), Archduke and later Holy Roman Emperor. Ferdinand I was a major patron of Maler, as was the wealthy merchant family, the Fuggers."
3024,"MÄLESSKIRCHER, Gabriel","(b. ca. 1425, ?, d. 1495, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malesski/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Bavaria. His work, still distinctive despite considerable losses, forms an important branch of the little-researched Munich school of painting of the later 15th century. He probably trained in the Netherlands."
3025,"MALINCONICO, Nicola","(b. ca. 1663, Napoli, d. 1721, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malincon/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active mainly in Naples. He was a follower of Massimo Stanzione and was influenced by Luca Giordano. He painted mostly religious subjects but painted also still-lifes recalling paintings by Pietro Paolo Bonzi and Paolo Porpora."
3026,"MALLET, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1759, Grasse, d. 1835, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mallet/biograph.html,"
French painter. A pupil of Simon Julien in Toulon, he was then taught by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon in Paris. He exhibited at every Salon between 1793 and 1827, obtaining a second class medal in 1812 and a first class medal in 1817. He executed very few portraits (Chénier, Carcassonne, Musée des Beaux-Arts, is an exception), preferring to paint nymphs bathing and graceful classical nudes such as the Graces Playing with Cupid (Arras, Abbaye St Vaast, Musée des Beaux-Arts). He established his reputation with gouache genre scenes of fashionable and often libertine subjects, always elegant and refined, in the style of Louis-Philibert Debucourt and Louis-Léopold Boilly, and remarkable for the delicacy and brilliance of their brushwork: for example At the Laundry Maid's and the Painful Letter (both Paris, Musée Cognacq-Jay). They reveal a knowledge of 17th-century Dutch painting in the treatment of details (transparent crystal, reflections on silk or satin) as well as the choice of themes: Military Gallant (Paris, Musée Cognacq-Jay)."
3027,"MALO, Vincent","(b. ca. 1595, Cambrai, d. ca. 1650, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malo/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active mainly in Italy as Vincenzo Malo, but he was also identified erroneously with a certain Vincenzo Armanno."
3028,"MALOMBRA, Pietro","(b. 1556, Venezia, d. 1618, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malombra/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil in the school of Giuseppe Porta (c. 1520-c. 1575). His designs are more studied and laboured than those of most of the Venetian painters. He copied Palma, but avoided the meanness of an imitator; and his pictures of the Miracles of St Francis de Paula, in the church of that name at Venice, fully express his style. His historical subjects are admirable, particularly those of the easel size. He painted architectural views of noted places in Venice, embellishing them with figures, beautifully arranged, and imagined with considerable ease and symmetry. He also produced many portraits.



"
3029,"MALOUEL, Jean",(active 1397-1415),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malouel/biograph.html,"
Jean Malouel (Dutch: Johan Maelwael), Netherlandish painter. He worked in Gelderland in 1386; he is documented in Paris in 1396 and from 1397 to 1415 he was court painter to the Dukes of Burgundy. In 1415 he was succeeded by Bellechose. He was the uncle of the Limbourg brothers.
"
3030,"MALTESE, Francesco",(active 1610-1660 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maltese/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also called Francesco Fieravino. He was a painter of still-lifes like his contemporary Benedetto Fioravanti, with whose works Maltese's have been confused. In 17th-century documents and inventories, however, a distinction between their paintings is made. The name of Maltese first appears in a Barberini inventory (1631-6), which lists 'six paintings in oil on paper, of varied flowers', and then in numerous inventories ending with that (1659) of the collection of Archduke Leopold William of Austria, in which his works are distinguished from those of Fioravanti."
3031,"MALTON, James","(b. ca. 1760, London, d. 1803, Marylebone)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malton/biograph.html,"
English painter, son of Thomas Malton (1726-1801), architectural draughtsman and writer on geometry, cabinet-maker and lecturer on perspective. He accompanied his father to Dublin, where he worked for architect James Gandon, despite a suspicion that the elder Malton had anonymously published severe criticism of Gandon's designs for the Royal Exchange in Dublin."
3032,"MALVITO, Tommaso",(active 1476-1508),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/malvito/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, tomb designer and architect, active in France and Italy. Little is known about his life. He was born in Como (Lombardy), and was a pupil of the Milanese Pietro di Martino. From 1476 to 1483 he was in Marseille, where he worked under Francesco Laurana. He was the father and teacher of Giovanni Tommaso Malvito de Sumalvito (active 15th century), sculptor. "
3033,"MAN, Cornelis de","(b. 1621, Delft, d. 1706, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/man/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He spent several years in Italy and France, an experience from which he did not greatly benefit for when he returned home he produced works with an abundance of detail, chiefly conversation pieces depicting middle-class life, in the manner of Vermeer and de Hooch. Although Pieter de Hooch had no recorded pupils he influenced and was imitated by other painters in Delft and Amsterdam, and since his own original works decline in his later period, his followers, among them de Man, come at times pretty close to him.



"
3034,"MANCINI, Francesco","(b. 1679, San Angelo in Vado, d. 1758, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mancini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was trained in Bologna in the school of Carlo Cignani, and his art is rooted in the classicist tradition of Bologna and Emilia Romagna. His achievements can be measured not only by his official appointments (French Academician, 1732; associate and regent of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, 1743, 1745; principal of the Accademia di S Luca, 1750-51) but also by the numerous commissions, almost exclusively ecclesiastical, that he obtained both in Rome and in the provinces. These made a significant contribution to the development of the form and iconography of the altarpiece. Mancini holds a remarkable position in the circle of artists working in the Papal States during the first half of the eighteenth century."

3036,"MANDER, Karel van, III","(b. 1609, Delft, d. 1670, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mander/karel3/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, printmaker, and art collector, grandson of Karel van Mander the Elder, active in Denmark. He was born in Delft, but arrived in Copenhagen with his mother, after the death of his father in 1623. He was a pupil of his father and was influenced by Frans Hals. He finished his education in Copenhagen, after which he began working for Christian IV. Trips to the Netherlands and Italy made him familiar with the leading schools and movements of the time. Having returned to Denmark he became the favourite portrait painter amongst the royal household and the nobility."
3037,"MANDIJN, Jan","(b. ca. 1500, Haarlem, d. 1559, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mandijn/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of north Netherlandish origin. He was trained in Haarlem but moved to Antwerp before 1530. Pieter Aertsen was living with Mandijn c. 1535, when Aertsen moved from Amsterdam to Antwerp. In 1537 Mandijn painted a copper memorial plaque for the Bishop of Dunkeld in Scotland, and he collaborated on the decoration of triumphal arches for Philip II's entrance into Antwerp in 1549. He took on pupils in Antwerp until 1559, the best known of whom are Hans van der Elburcht (active 1536-53), Gillis Mostaert and Bartholomäus Spranger. The connection with Mandijn may explain the common stylistic features of the work of Aertsen and van der Elburcht.



"
3038,"MANET, Edouard","(b. 1832, Paris, d. 1883, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manet/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He was the eldest son of Auguste Manet, a high-ranking city servant in the Ministère de la Justice, and Eugénie-Désirée Fournier, the daughter of a French diplomat posted to Stockholm. He intended to become a naval officer, and embarked for Rio de Janeiro aboard a trainee-ship. On his return to Le Havre he failed the entrance exam to the École Navale, and in 1850 he started a career in art in Paris. He studied with the French academic painter Thomas Couture."
3039,"MANETTI, Rutilio","(b. 1571, Siena, d. 1639, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manetti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a student of the Late Mannerist artists Francesco Vanni and Ventura Salimbeni. His earliest paintings, and especially his frescoes illustrating the Story of St Catherine and Pope Gregory (1597; Siena, Palazzo Pubblico) and his altarpiece of the Baptism (1599-1600; Siena, S Giovannino in Pantaneto), are strongly influenced by their works and also those of Federico Barocci. Although his style changed considerably during his career, Manetti never fully abandoned the fleshy, oval facial types with delicate, sweet features and the cluttered compositions that typify Sienese Mannerism. From 1600 to 1610 his paintings, for example the fresco cycle of the Story of St Roch (1605 to 1610; Siena, S Rocco alla Lupa), drew on the clear narrative style, naturalistic light effects and particularized figure types of Florentine painters such as Bernardino Poccetti and Domenico Passignano."
3040,MANFREDINO DA PISTOIA,(active 1280–1293),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manfred/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. In 1280 he was paid for (lost) frescoes in the chapel of San Procolo, Pistoia Cathedral. His next known activity was in 1292, when he signed a fresco cycle in San Michele de Fassolo, Genoa, as Magister Manfredinus Pistoriensis. Only detached fragments survive (Genoa, Museo di Sant'Agostino), but they reveal that Manfredino was one of the more eloquent artists of the late 13th century. The dynamic pose and physical solidity of the St Michael shows a keen and intelligent response to the art of Cimabue, whose example can be seen in the modelling and facial construction of the figures in the other major surviving fragment, the Anointing at Bethany. Here Manfredino adds to the traditional Byzantine iconography a sympathetic and psychologically alert sense of the dramatic undertones and a remarkably ambitious and detailed backdrop of a city scene. The last record of his activity is in a Genoese document of 1293.

French architect, active in the Trier and Mainz region in Germany. He built the Schloss Monaise near Trier for the Counts of Walderburg between 1779 and 1786. The deanery of Mainz Cathedral, built by Mangin in 1781-86 and destroyed in 1793 during the revolutionary wars, was one of the most modern buildings of its day in Germany.

French painter, draughtsman and engraver, active in Italy. The son of a modest painter and godson of Adriaen van der Cabel, he learnt figure painting with Frere Imbert in Lyon. He travelled to Rome in 1715, where he spent much of his time making studies of ships (Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs) and even of Turks and camels (Paris, École National Supérieur des Beax-Arts). He also trained in the studio of Bernardino Fergioni (1674-1738) and learnt from those artists in the circle of the sculptor Pierre Legros, who was to purchase two seascapes by Manglard before 1719. His skill as a marine painter was such that his career advanced rapidly: prestigious clients included Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy and King of Piedmont, who bought two matching pieces from him in 1726 (Turin, Galleria Sabauda), and Philip, Duke of Parma (d 1765), who acquired a pair in 1759 (Colorno, Palazzo Ducale), and the Rospigliosi family in Rome, for whom he produced a number of pictures (Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano)."
3044,"MANGONE, Fabio","(b. 1587, Caravaggio, d. 1629, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mangone/biograph.html,"

3047,"MANSART, François","(b. 1598, Paris, d. 1666, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mansart/biograph.html,"
French architect, important for establishing classicism in Baroque architecture in mid-17th-century France. His buildings are notable for their subtlety, elegance, and harmony. His most complete surviving work is the château of Maisons."
3048,"MANSUETI, Giovanni",(known 1485-1526 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mansueti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Trained in the shop of Gentile Bellini, Mansueti distinguished himself for his large altarpieces and his treatment of religious subjects, such as the canvases in the series Scenes from the Life of St Mark for the Scuola Grande di San Marco in Venice (today dispersed in museums in Venice, Milan, and Vaduz). His masterpiece is the Miracle of the True Cross (now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). This composition is crowded with figures set among fantastically conceived buildings that recall the world of Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio.

The brothers Cristoforo Mantegazza and Antonio Mantegazza were, with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, major sculptors in Milan during the later 15th century. Their dates of birth are unknown, and no documented or signed work exists by either. The earliest documentation of their activities records Cristoforo at the Certosa di Pavia in 1464 working with other sculptors to furnish stones carved as arches, vaults and columns for the walls of the nave. Also in 1464 he worked in the Certosa's two cloisters, making capitals for the large cloister. In 1465 he designed wooden models for the terracotta capitals in the large cloister, working with the sculptor Rinaldo de' Stauris (active 1461-1490). On 26 August 1467 Cristoforo was given six pieces of marble for works to be made for the Castello Sforzesco, Milan."

Mantegna, Andrea (1431-1506), one of the foremost north Italian painters of the 15th century. A master of perspective and foreshortening, he made important contributions to the compositional techniques of Renaissance painting.
"
3052,"MANUEL, Niklaus","(b. ca. 1484, Bern, d. 1530, Bern)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manuel/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter and poet and statesman; formerly sometimes wrongly called N. M. Deutsch on the basis of his monogram N.M.D.: the ""D"" is now thought to stand for the surname ""Degen"". As a member of the Inner Council of Berne, Manuel had an important influence on the debates on religious reform, having already made a name with plays attacking ecclesiastical abuses. As a painter Manuel was obviously affected by the work of Dürer and Baldung Grien; but his richly coloured pictures of biblical and mythological subjects frequently have dramatic effects of lighting and mood of landscape peculiar to him. His paintings include: The Execution of John the Baptist and the Judgement of Paris.


"
3053,"MANUTIUS, Aldus","(b. ca. 1450, Bassiano, d. 1515, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manutius/biograph.html,"
Italian printer, publisher, teacher and translator. He studied in Rome and Ferrara and spent some time in Mirandola with Giovanni Pico (1463-94). In 1483 he was tutor to the Pio family. He formed a project to publish Greek texts and in 1489-90 moved to Venice, where soon afterwards he published the Musarum panegyris (1491). His Greek publications formed the core of his activities: he issued c. 30 first editions of literary and philosophical Greek texts including a five-volume Aristotle (1495-98). The first book printed with his own newly cut Greek type was the Erotemata (1495) by Constantine Lascaris (1434-?1501). Three further Aldine Greek types were developed, the last in 1502."
3054,"MÁNYOKI, Ádám","(b. 1673, Szokolya, d. 1757, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/manyoki/biograph.html,"
The most significant Hungarian painter of his age. Mányoki, the son of a protestant priest, learnt to paint in Hamburg first, then he became a pupil of A. Scheitz, a famous German painter, in Hannover. His development was especially influenced by French portrait painters, in particular by Largillière. He served the Prussian court where he met the wife of Ferenc Rákóczi II, a reigning prince, then the prince himself, who soon made him his court painter. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Netherlands. On Rákóczi's recommendation, he was taken into the service of Augustine, the Strong, Saxonian prince-elector and Polish king. He worked in Warsaw in 1713, in Dresden and in Berlin in 1714 where he painted mostly portraits of people and famous beauties of the court."
3055,"MARABITTI, Ignazio","(b. 1719, Palermo, d. 1797, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marabitt/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He trained in Rome in the studio of Filippo della Valle, head of the Accademia di San Luca, but was mainly active in Sicily, where his most notable work is the Fontana del Genio in the Villa Giulia, and several prominent statues on the façade of the Cathedral of Syracuse.



"
3056,"MARASTONI, Jakab","(b. 1804, Venezia, d. 1860, Pest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maraston/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter of Italian descent. He left Vienna for Bratislava in 1834 and went from Bratislava to Pest in 1836. Together with Miklós Barabás, he was one of the most productive Hungarian painters of his age. The delicate touch, the warm colours and the harmonic composition made him popular with the public. In 1846 he established the First Hungarian Academy of Painting launching art training in Hungary. Although his academy could not rival with academies abroad, he helped Károly Lotz, Mihály Zichy, etc. to start their careers. He lost his eyesight in 1854 and ended up in a madhouse.



"
3057,"MARATTI, Carlo","(b. 1625, Camarano, d. 1713, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maratti/biograph.html,"
Carlo Maratti (Maratta) Italian painter, the leading painter in Rome in the latter part of the 17th century. As the pupil of Andrea Sacchi he continued the tradition of the classical Grand Manner, based on Raphael, and he gained an international reputation particularly for his paintings of the Madonna and Child, which are reworkings of types established during the High Renaissance. The rhetorical splendour of his work is thoroughly in the Baroque idiom, however, and the numerous altarpieces he painted for Roman churches (many still in situ) give whole-hearted expression to the dogmas of the Counter-Reformation. Maratta was also an accomplished fresco painter, and the finest portraitist of the day in Rome. He had a large studio and his posthumous reputation suffered when the inferior works of his many pupils and imitators were confused with his own paintings.



"
3058,"MARCANOVA, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1414, Venezia, d. 1467, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marcanov/biograph.html,"

"
3059,"MARCELLINI, Carlo Andrea","(b. ca. 1644, Firenze, d. 1713, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marcelli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, stuccoist and architect. After training in Florence as a goldsmith, he studied with the painter Felice Ficherelli (1605-c. 1669). In 1671 he went to Rome, having been chosen for the Tuscan Accademia Granducale. He studied sculpture under Ercole Ferrata and Ciro Ferri, showing a predilection for modelling rather than the marble carving expected by his patron, Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany."
3060,"MARCHESINI, Alessandro","(b. 1663, Verona, d. 1738, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marchesi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and art merchant, active in Northern Italy and Venice. He is traditionally believed to have trained with Biagio Falcieri (1628-1703). At the age of 17 he moved to Bologna, where he entered the workshop of Carlo Cignani. His first commission after his return to Verona was for the fresco decoration of the vault of San Domenico (1687), with scenes glorifying the saint, set in a quadratura framework by Carlo Tedesco. The style is heavily Baroque. In 1690-91 Marchesini painted a Jonah for San Niccolo, Verona; this remains within a Veronese tradition, whereas his Assumption of the Virgin for San Biagio (1692; Breonio, SS Marziale e Giovanni) and his Purification of the Virgin (1699; Verona, Palazzo Scaligero, Notai Chapel) contain references to the Bolognese art of the Carracci.


"
3061,"MARCHETTI, Ludovico","(b. 1853, Roma, d. 1909, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marchett/biograph.html,"

3062,"MARCHIONNI, Carlo","(b. 1702, Roma, d. 1786, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marchion/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, sculptor, and draftsman. Marchionni's early career was fostered by his lifelong friend Cardinal Alessandro Albani, a great collector of antiquities. His mature style exhibits a richly-detailed idiomatic repertory on the cusp of Late Baroque and Neoclassicism that may be compared with the similar style by his Italian contemporaries Alessandro Galilei, Ferdinando Fuga or Vanvitelli, or indeed with their French contemporary, Ange-Jacques Gabriel."
3063,"MARCHIORI, Giovanni","(b. 1696, Caviola d'Agordo, d. 1778, Treviso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marchior/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He may have trained with Andrea Brustolon, but his style was more influenced by the elegant classicism of such Venetian sculptors as Giuseppe Torretti and Antonio Corradini. His first recorded work is a wooden sacristy cupboard (c. 1715) for the parish church at Caviola, and before 1738 he had carved the six marble Sibyls and the seven marble Apostles for Santa Maria degli Scalzi, Venice. The signed marble statues of St Alexis and St Juliana for the Servite church in Venice (now in Fratta Polesine, Parish Church) were completed in 1738, and there followed low reliefs in wood, showing scenes from the Life of St Roch (1741) for the Scuola di San Rocco, Venice, which were distinguished by their varied compositions and elaborate settings, enriched by surprisingly naturalistic architecture and landscape."
3064,MARCO ROMANO,(active c. 1318),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marco/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He is known from a single surviving sculpture, the effigy of St Simeon in San Simeone Grande, Venice. The tomb, commissioned to preserve the relics of the Saint, no longer survives. An inscribed tablet accompanying the effigy records the names of the clerics who commissioned the monument, the sculptor's name MARCUS ROMANUS and the date 4 February 1317 (NS 1318). The style of the statue in its confident treatment of the supine figure and the summary but convincing delineation of drapery folds points to a sculptor of considerable skill and experience who was outside the mainstream of early 14th-century Venetian sculpture. The expressive head with its prominent cheekbones, furrowed brow and heavy features and the realistic detail of the teeth just showing between strong lips, suggest knowledge of the work of Giovanni Pisano and, in particular, his series of prophets and sibyls for Siena Cathedral. Remarkably progressive in comparison to contemporary Venetian sculpture, St Simon was to provide the starting-point for subsequent tomb effigies in the Veneto: that of the Blessed Oderico da Pordenone (1331) by Filippo de Santi for Santa Maria del Carmine, Udine, is the most significant.



"
3065,"MARCONI, Rocco",(active 1504-1521 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marconi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is mentioned as being a native of Treviso, but signed himself venetus in the contractual document for an altarpiece for Treviso. He may have been born in Venice to parents originating from Bergamo. He is documented for the first time as a witness in 1504, and then several times until 1529, including in 1517 as an auditor of the Guild of Painters, a sign that by this time he was already established."

3067,"MARÉES, George de","(b. 1697, Stockholm, d. 1776, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marees/biograph.html,"
George de Marées (or Georges Desmarées), Swedish painter, active in Germany. His father was descended from French émigrés to Sweden, his mother from the Mijtens family of Netherlandish artists. He was a pupil at the painting school of his uncle, Martin van Mytens II, in Stockholm from 1710. His early portraits, painted while he was still in Sweden, reveal the influence of van Mytens and his French models, Hyacinthe Rigaud and Nicolas de Largillière."
3068,"MARÉES, Hans von","(b. 1837, Elberfeld, d. 1887, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marees_h/biograph.html,"
German painter, mainly of mythologies, who went to Italy in 1864. In 1869 he visited Spain, France, and the Netherlands with the writer on art, Konrad Fiedler, his future biographer. He served in the Francp-Prussian War of 1870-71, but was able to return to Italy in 1873 and began his most famous work, the frescoes in the Aquarium at Naples, on which he was assisted by Adolf von Hildebrand, the leading German sculptor. He spent the rest of his life in Italy, and, like Böcklin and Feuerbach, he was essentially a German Romantic who longed for Italy: unlike Leibl, he was untouched by the Realist movement and all that it implied. In spite of his interest in wall-painting and the success of his Naples frescoes he never succeeded in obtaining another monumental commission, The style of the frescoes is similar to that of his great French contemporary, Puvis de Chavannes."
3069,MARGARITO D'AREZZO,(active 1250-1290),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/margarit/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, known as Margaritone. The only documentary record of Margarito dates from 1262, when he was living in Arezzo. The nature and distribution of his surviving works suggest a thriving practice and a steady demand for his skills throughout Tuscany. Margarito's fame outside Italy rests partly on Vasari's account, partly on his easy identifiability among a host of anonymous contemporaries (most of his paintings are signed) and partly on the role imposed on him by 19th-century critics as an epitome of that barbarism into which Italian painting was deemed to have fallen by the late 13th century. Margarito seems to stand rather outside the main line of painting in Tuscany and has at times been dismissed as reactionary or provincial. Establishing a chronology for his work in the absence of any surviving dates is problematic."
3070,"MARIANI, Camillo","(b. ca. 1565, Vicenza, d. 1611, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mariani/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, born in Vicenza. He trained in the school of Alessandro Vittoria in Venice. He made his debut in Rome in 1597 with work on the chapel of the Angeli in the church of the Gesù, he made a few little stucco putti."
3071,"MARIESCHI, Michele","(b. 1710, Venezia, d. 1743, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mariesch/biograph.html,"
Michele - or in Venetian parlance Michiel - Marieschi, Venetian veduta painter. He is much less well known to the public at large than his famous contemporaries Canaletto and Guardi. On the one hand this has to do with the fact that the painter died as a young man, on the other that knowledge of his work is still rather limited. In his best work Marieschi proved himself to be an artist with a style all his own, generally characterized by dark tones and loose brushwork.

"
3072,"MARIETTE, Jean","(b. 1660, Paris, d. 1742, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mariette/biograph.html,"
French engraver and painter. The son of Pierre Mariette II and Geneviève Lenoir, demonstrated from an early age a flair for the fine arts. He studied under his brother-in-law, Jean-Baptiste Corneille, who taught him drawing, painting and engraving, and Mariette initially focused his efforts on painting. However, when Charles Le Brun saw some of his engravings, he persuaded him to concentrate on this genre. Heeding Le Brun's advice, Mariette intended to make reproductions of great pictures, in the style of Gérard Audran (1640-1703), for whom he had a particular admiration, but after marrying Claude-Geneviève Coignard and setting up as a bookseller and print-dealer, he mainly produced everyday works. Even so, the catalogue of these engravings lists no less than 35 reproductions of pictures and various subjects, after his own drawings and after Nicolas Poussin, Michel Corneille, Cheron, Antoine Dieu, Guido Reni, Annibale Carracci, Sébastien Bourdon, Contarini, Charles Le Brun, Van Dyck, Alexander and Domenico Zampieri."
3073,"MARIGLIANO, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1488, Nola, d. 1558, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mariglia/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Marigliano (Giovanni da Nola), Italian wood-carver and sculptor. He trained in Naples as a wood-carver under Pietro Belverte (d. 1513), executing polychromed wooden reliefs (1507; Naples, San Lorenzo; destroyed) and crib figures (1507; Naples, San Domenico Maggiore). In 1508 he and Belverte assisted Tommaso Malvito (active 1484-1508) on a frame for an image of St Anne and on doors at the Ospizio dell'Annunziata, Naples."
3074,"MARILHAT, Prosper","(b. 1811, Vertaizon, d. 1847, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marilhat/biograph.html,"
French painter. He painted his first landscapes and family portraits at Thiers and in the Auvergne before moving to Paris in 1829. After working as the pupil of Camille Roqueplan he was engaged by Baron Karl von Hügel for an expedition to the Near East (1831-33), from which he brought back numerous studies. He visited Greece, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, stayed in Egypt from October 1831 to May 1833 and returned by way of Rhodes and Corfu. Cairo, the villages of the Delta and Upper Egypt proved to be sources of inspiration for later works. At Alexandria he painted theatre sets and numerous court portraits."
3075,"MARIN, Joseph Charles","(b. 1759, Paris, d. 1834, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He emulated the graceful Rococo style of his master, Clodion, and enjoyed a successful career, working largely for private patrons and exhibiting at the Paris Salon from 1791 to 1833. Most of his works are terracotta busts, statuettes and groups made in imitation of Clodion's erotic Rococo female figures, but with an added touch of realism and a more marked interest in varieties of texture. Among them are a Bust of a Girl (Paris, Musée Jacquemart-André), the statuettes Ganymede and Hebe (Bayonne, Musée Bonnat) and the Young Girl with a Dove (1791; Paris, Louvre). More severe is his group Canadian Indians at their Infant's Grave (1794; private collection)."
3076,"MARINALI, Orazio","(b. 1643, Angarano, d. 1720, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marinali/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, the most celebrated member of the family of artists. His father, Francesco Marinali was a sculptor. The family established a workshop in Vicenza and were active throughout the Veneto in the late 17th century and early 18th."
3077,"MARINARI, Onorio","(b. 1627, Firenze, d. 1715, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marinari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of a minor painter, Sigismondo di Pietro Marinari, from whom he received his first tuition, and the cousin of Carlo Dolci, whose best pupil he became. Sources mention him assisting Dolci in the later 1650s. While he remained capable of imitating closely his master's style, he was later influenced by Pignone and Furini. He executed a number of altarpieces for Florentine churches and his fresco in the Palazzo Capponi, Florence, is dated 1707. In 1674 he published his illustrated Fabbrica ed uso dell' Annulo Astronomico. A self-portrait in the Uffizi shows him aged eighty-two in 1709. He died in Florence on 5 January 1715. There are few signed or documented works, and Marinari's oeuvre has still to be clearly defined.



"
3078,MARIO DEI FIORE,"(b. 1603, Roma, d. 1673, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mario/biograph.html,"
Mario dei Fiori (originally Mario Nuzzi), Italian painter. He was the first and most famous Roman painter to specialize in flower-pieces and one of only four still-life artists included by Leone Pascoli in his collection of artists' biographies. The early sources and old inventories attribute many flower paintings in distinguished Roman collections to the Caravaggesque painter Tommaso Salini, and since the 18th century Mario's name has been linked with his, and it has been assumed that he trained with Salini. This apprenticeship is difficult to document, yet a comparison of Mario's pictures with inventory descriptions of works by Salini confirms that Mario was influenced by his art. To the minute observation of various kinds of flowers, Mario added a refined sense of design and an interest in effects of light, still linked to Caravaggio in the use of a dark background. He also responded to the art of the Neapolitan flower painter Paolo Porpora, who was in Rome from the early 1650s, in the service, as was Mario, of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. He painted the flowers on several paintings by Carlo Maratti, such as the Adoration of the Magi in the Hermitage, St. Petersburg."
3079,MARIOTTO DI NARDO,"(active 1394, Firenze, d. 1424, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mariotto/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the son of the sculptor Nardo di Cione (active c. 1380; namesake of the painter) and was probably trained by his father. Realizing his talent for painting at a young age, Mariotto established himself as a painter of frescoes and panel paintings and an illuminator of manuscripts. He was in great demand for public and private commissions. Early in his career, he became the principal artist for the cathedral in his native Florence. Following suit, most of the important churches in Florence also commissioned frescoes from him, and religious orders commissioned him to paint illuminated manuscripts. He worked in Santa Maria Maggiore and at Orsanmichele."
3080,"MARIS, Jacobus Hendricus","(b. 1837, Den Haag, d. 1899, Karlsbad)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maris/jacobus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters. By the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Johannes Stroebel (1821-1905), and from 1850 he attended classes at the Academie in The Hague. In 1854 he accompanied his teacher, Huib van Hove (1814-1864), to Antwerp, where he attended evening classes at the Academie for two years and made contact with Louis Meijer (1809-1866), the marine painter. In 1855 he was joined in Antwerp by his brother Matthijs Maris, with whom he shared a workshop and house. For a short period their friend and fellow student Laurens Alma-Tadema came to live with them. They lived on Matthijs's grant and made small paintings, based on 17th-century Dutch genre pictures, for the American market."
3081,"MARIS, Matthijs","(b. 1839, Den Haag, d. 1917, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maris/matthijs/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, brother of Jacobus Maris. In 1851 he was apprenticed for one year to Isaac Elink Sterk (1808-1871); from 1852 to 1855 he attended classes at the Academie in The Hague, and in 1854 he joined the studio of Louis Meijer (1809-1866), where his brother Jacobus was also working. It was due to Meijer that in 1855 he was granted a monthly allowance by Queen Sophie to continue his training in Antwerp, where he moved in with Jacobus. Through his studies at the Academie, Matthijs met the German painter Georg Laves (1789-1864), who introduced him to the work of the 19th-century German Romantic painters, in particular Ludwig Richter."
3082,"MARIS, Willem","(b. 1844, Den Haag, d. 1910, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maris/willem/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, brother of Jacob Maris. He received his training as a painter from his brothers, Jacob Maris and Matthijs Maris. Although he briefly attended evening classes at the Academie in The Hague and was advised by the animal painter Pieter Stortenbeker (1828-1898), he was basically self-taught; he was the only 'self-made' man in the circle of Hague School artists. In 1862 he visited Oosterbeek where he met Anton Mauve, with whom he established a long friendship. In the same year he first entered a painting, Cows on the Heath (untraced), in the Tentoonstellung van Levende Meesters [Exhibition of Living Masters] in Rotterdam. The themes of cows at pasture and ducks by the side of a ditch, which characterized the Dutch polder landscape in summer, became his hallmark. In the following year he exhibited Cows by a Pool (The Hague, Gemeentemuseum) in The Hague; it received discouraging reviews, as did the picture entered by his brother Matthijs. Painted in 1863, this work already employs Willem's main motif and shows his attention to the handling of light (with effects of haze and backlighting)."
3083,"MARKÓ, Károly the Elder","(b. 1791, Lõcse, d. 1869, Villa Appeggi)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marko/father/biograph.html,"
Markó was one of the greatest Hungarian landscapists of the first half of the 19th century. He studied at the Academy in Vienna after 1822. Around 1830 he painted several landscapes depicting the Hungarian regions in Neoclassicist style: Visegrád is the most famous among them. With the help of the banker Geymüller he travelled to Italy in 1832; he spent the rest of his life there. He worked in Rome, Pisa, and Florence. After moving to Italy he worked in the style of the so-called heroic landscape painting. He depicted idealized landscapes with mythological or folkloric figures. Fishermen and The Tivoli Region are the most typical examples of this style. The Puszta (Great Hungarian Plain) is a memento of his visit to Hungary in 1853; this painting reveals the influence of Romanticism.



"
3084,"MARKÓ, András","(b. 1824, Wien, d. 1895, Viareggio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marko/son1/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter and draughtsman, son of Károly Markó the Elder. He studied first in Florence and then in 1851 at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna under Carl Rahl. In the early 1850s he exhibited with the Artists Association of Pest and the Hungarian National Fine Arts Association; in 1852 and 1854 his Italian landscapes were shown, and in 1854 he also exhibited his Hungarian Landscape (Budapest, Hungarian National Gallery) in Milan."
3085,"MARKÓ, Ferenc","(b. 1832, Eisenstadt, d. 1874, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marko/son2/biograph.html,"
Painter and draughtsman, son of Károly Markó the Elder. He studied first with his father then for two years at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence, where he concentrated on life drawing and figure painting. He took part in the struggle for Italian independence and was imprisoned (before 1853) for his political drawings. Subsequently he painted landscapes of the Appennines and of Rome and Carrara."
3086,"MARKÓ, Károly the Younger","(b. 1822, Pest, d. 1891, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marko/son3/biograph.html,"
Painter, son of Károly Markó the Elder. He studied in the landscape painting department of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna (1836) and from 1838 under his father in Italy. In 1843 he visited Rome and Florence, and in 1845 he took part in the exhibitions of the Societa Promotrice di Belle Arti in Florence. From 1851 to 1854 he lived in Vienna, showing his paintings in the exhibitions of the Österreichische Kunstverein (e.g. Carrara Landscape, 1852). His work was also exhibited in Milan, Genoa and Livorno, and he sent some paintings to be shown in the Budapest Artists Circle and in the Hungarian National Fine Arts Association exhibitions. He became an honorary member of the academies in Florence, Genoa, Perugia and Urbino."
3087,"MARLOW, William","(b. 1740, London, d. 1813, Twickenham)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marlow/biograph.html,"
English painter. From c. 1756 to 1761 he was a pupil of Samuel Scott, the topographical and marine painter; he also studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy, London. Throughout his career Marlow made oils and watercolours of London views, for example Near Westminster Bridge, Evening (London, Guildhall Art Gallery), which shows his balanced, classical sense of composition, sensitivity to lighting effects and smooth handling of oil paint."
3088,"MARMION, Simon","(b. ca. 1420, Amiens, d. 1489, Valenciennes)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marmion/biograph.html,"
Franco-Flemish manuscript illuminator and painter. In 1449-54 he was at Amiens, where he may have been born, and he was a member of the Tournai guild in 1468, but the greater part of his working life was spent at Valenciennes. He had a great reputation in his day, but no works certainly from his hand survived. The main work attributed to him is the retable of St Bertin (1459, most of it in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, fragments in the National Gallery, London). His style was very tender, with delicate, almost pastel colouring, and does not belong to the mainstream of either French or Netherlandish art.



"
3089,"MARMITTA, Francesco","(b. ca. 1460, Parma, d. ca. 1504, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marmitta/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator, painter and gem-engraver. According to Vasari, Marmitta lived in Parma and, after training as a painter, became an engraver of gemstones, 'closely imitating the ancients'. Although no signed work is known, he is mentioned in verses prefacing a manuscript of Petrarch's Canzoniere and Trionfi.



"
3090,"MAROCHETTI, Charles","(b. 1805, Torino, d. 1867, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marochet/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His father, Vincenzo Marochetti, was a prominent advocate and functionary. The family moved to Paris shortly after Carlo's birth. Marochetti trained with François-Joseph Bosio and, after failing to win the Prix de Rome, travelled to Italy in 1822 at his own expense. On his return he showed Young Girl with a Dog (Turin, Castello d'Aglie) at the Salon of 1827. His exhibit at the Salon of 1831, Rebel Angel (plaster; untraced), established his allegiance to the Romantic cause. Marochetti succeeded in projecting this Romanticism in public monuments: in his marble relief of the Battle of Jemmapes (1833-34) on the Arc de Triomphe and, in a more original form, in the group of the Assumption of the Magdalene (marble, 1834-44) for the church of the Madeleine, Paris, the latter an apotheosis deriving from the Baroque, but strongly symmetrical and denuded of scenic apparatus."
3091,"MARON, Anton von","(b. 1733, Wien, d. 1808, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maron/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied at the Vienna Akademie and, in 1755, he went to Rome, where he was based for the rest of his life. From 1756 to 1761 he was first the pupil then the assistant of Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1765 he married Mengs's sister, the miniature painter Theresia Concordia Mengs. After collaborating on Mengs's fresco paintings in Rome (at S Eusebio and the Villa Albani; both in situ), Maron, working independently in Rome, spent some time on altar pictures (S Maria dell'Anima) and on various decorative projects. Mengs's influence is evident in Maron's ceiling pictures in the casino of the Villa Borghese (1784; in situ), where five paintings tell the Story of Aeneas and Dido in the style of quadri riportati, using clear construction, sharply defined drawing and a historical concept based on antiquity. Although he received many commissions for this type of work, Maron's true gifts lay in the field of portraiture."
3092,"MAROT, Daniel I","(b. 1661, Paris, d. 1752, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marot/daniel1/biograph.html,"
French architect, designer and engraver, active in the Netherlands, part of a family of artists, son of Jean Marot I. Daniel Marot I was a successful engraver in Paris, until anti-Protestant legislation obliged him to emigrate to the Netherlands, where he became principal designer to William of Orange."
3093,"MAROT, Jean I","(b. 1619, Paris, d. 1679, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marot/jean1/biograph.html,"
Engraver and architect, part of a French family of artists of Netherlandish origin. Jean Marot I, son of Girard Marot, a cabinetmaker, worked as engraver and architect; little remains of his architectural projects, but his engravings of architectural designs, highly regarded in his lifetime, have become one of the most important sources for an understanding of French architecture before the great building campaigns of Louis XIV. One of his brothers, Jean-Baptiste Marot (b. 1632), appears to have been a painter. One of Jean Marot's own sons, Daniel Marot I, was a successful engraver in Paris, until anti-Protestant legislation obliged him to emigrate to the Netherlands, where he became principal designer to William of Orange; Jean Marot's other son, Jean Marot II, probably worked with his father as an engraver and, later, as an architect of the Bâtiments du Roi in Nantes and Paris between 1686 and 1702. Daniel Marot's son, Daniel Marot II, worked as a decorative painter on a number of his father's projects."
3094,"MARREL, Jacob","(b. ca. 1613, Frankenthal, d. 1681, Frankfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marrel/biograph.html,"
German painter. Although born in Frankenthal on the Rhine, Marrel is more closely associated with the two great centres of still-life painting in northern Europe: Frankfurt and Utrecht.  Having initially trained under Georg Flegel in the former, he soon moved to Utrecht in the early 1630s where he worked with Jan Davidsz. de Heem. He also came under the influence of the Bosschaert family of flower painters and Roelandt Savery, who had settled in Utrecht after working for Rudolf II in Prague."
3095,"SCHRIECK, Otto Marseus van","(b. 1619/20, Nijmegen, d. 1678, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marseus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. It is difficult to categorize him: he made a few still-lifes, but he is best known for his mysterious dark close-ups of the live undergrowth of forest floors that give detailed views of wild flowers, weeds, thistles, and mushrooms animated by phosphorescent butterflies, insects, reptiles, and snakes. These works, strictly speaking not still-lifes, have always appealed to collectors of highly finished Dutch cabinet pictures. Naturalists have a field day identifying their flora and fauna, and so do iconographers who give detailed commentaries on their content, which are generally related to the transience theme."
3096,"MARSHALL, Benjamin","(b. 1768, Seagrave, d. 1835, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marshall/biograph.html,"
English painter. The son of Charles and Elizabeth Marshall, he spent his childhood at Seagrave, Leicestershire. During the 1780s he is believed to have taken drawing instruction from John Boultbee (1753-1812), although as late as 1791 his profession was recorded (on his brother-in-law's will) as schoolmaster. In this year he was introduced by William Pochin, MP, of Barkby Hall, Leicestershire, to the portrait painter Lemuel Francis Abbott with whom he subsequently embarked on an apprenticeship. This seems not to have lasted, for he completed a painting of a horse for George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), in 1792 (the first of several such commissions in the 1790s); this belies the traditional story that he turned to sporting art after seeing Sawrey Gilpin's Death of the Fox on exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1793."
3097,"MARSTRAND, Wilhelm Nicolai","(b. 1810, København, d. 1873, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marstran/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, one of the most prominent artists of his time. A pupil of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Denmark from 1826 to 1833, he was one of the representatives, together with some other pupils of Eckersberg, of the Danish Golden Age. Christian Waagepetersen, wine merchant to the Danish court and supporter of the arts, became an important patron for Marstrand during his early period."
3098,"MARSY, Balthazard","(b. 1628, Cambrai, d. 1674, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marsy/balthaza/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. The brothers Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy were originally from Cambrai, they moved to Paris and were employed by King Louis XIV, particularly for the decoration of the palace and gardens at Versailles."
3099,"MARSY, Gaspard","(b. 1624, Cambrai, d. 1681, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marsy/gaspard/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. The brothers Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy were originally from Cambrai, they moved to Paris and were employed by King Louis XIV, particularly for the decoration of the palace and gardens at Versailles."
3100,"MARTELLANGE, Étienne","(b. ca. 1568, Lyon, d. 1641, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martella/biograph.html,"
French architect, painter and draughtsman (also known as Ange, Étienne Martel). He was the grandson of a painter of stained glass and son of a painter from Lyon, and he began his own career as a painter. Martellange trained in Italy from 1586 to 1587 with François Stella (1563-1605), and in 1590 he entered the Jesuit Order at Avignon, with the title of Pictor, taking his vows as a coadjutor brother at Chambéry in 1603; he was not, however, ordained a priest."
3101,"MARTIN, John","(b. 1789, Haydon Bridge, d. 1854, Douglas, Isle of Man)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martin/biograph.html,"
English Romantic painter and mezzotint engraver, celebrated for his melodramatic scenes of cataclysmic events crowded with tiny figures placed in vast architectural settings. He caught the public imagination with spectacular paintings such as Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still (United Grand Lodge of Great Britain, London, 1816), the work that made him famous, and in 1821 Lawrence referred to him as 'the most popular painter of the day'. His work was indeed truly popular, for he made his living mainly through the sale of engravings of his pictures rather than the paintings themselves. He became famous in France as well as Britain, he was knighted by Leopold I of Belgium (1833), and his influence was felt by American artists such as Cole. However, while he pleased a vast audience and was regarded by some admirers as one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived, Martin was reviled by Ruskin and other critics, who considered his work vulgar sensationalism. Few artists, indeed, have been subject to such extremes of critical fortune, and his fame sank to such an astonishing degree after his death that very large and once famous paintings by him were sold in the 1930s for as little as £ 2. In the 1970s his reputation greatly revived."
3102,"MARTIN, David","(b. 1737, Anstruther, Fife, d. 1798, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martin_d/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter and engraver. He was a pupil of Allan Ramsay from c. 1752; in 1755 he joined Ramsay in Rome, where he remained for over a year, studying under the patronage of Robert Alexander, an Edinburgh banker. On Ramsay's return to Britain, Martin worked for him in London until 1775, painting most of the drapery work during the early and middle 1760s."
3103,"MARTIN, Henri-Jean-Guillaume","(b. 1860, Toulouse, d. 1943, La Bastide-du-Vert)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martin_h/biograph.html,"
French painter. After winning the Grand Prix at the École des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse, he moved to Paris (1879) to study at the École des Beaux-Arts there under Jean-Paul Laurens, who encouraged his interest in Veronese and other Venetian painters. The literary inspiration of his early work was reflected in such paintings as Paolo de Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini in Hell (1883; Carcassonne, Musée des Beaux-Arts) based on Dante, for which he won a medal at the Salon of 1883. During his subsequent study in Rome, however, on a fellowship awarded to him at the Salon, he was attracted both by the brilliant Italian light and by the paintings of Giotto and his contemporaries. He developed his own style with its characteristic short, divisionist brush-strokes."
3104,"MARTIN, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1659, Paris, d. 1735, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martin_j/biograph.html,"
French painter, called Martin des Batailles. He trained in the studio of Laurent de La Hyre. There the Marquis de Vauban noticed his skill in making accurate drawings of plans and elevations of fortified sites and introduced him to the battle painter Adam Frans van der Meulen, who from 1664 was employed by Louis XIV, mainly to paint scenes commemorating Louis's military triumphs, many of which were used as tapestry designs. He quickly became van der Meulen's closest and chief collaborator. Indeed, the closeness of collaboration between the master and his pupils created a homogeneous style, in which the hand of the individual is difficult to determine. On van der Meulen's death (1690), Martin and Sauveur Lecomte (?1659-95) were ordered to complete the series of twelve paintings showing the King's Conquests, seven of which were still unfinished."
3105,"MARTIN, Pierre-Denis","(b. ca. 1663, Paris, d. 1742, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martin_p/biograph.html,"
French painter, also called Martin le Jeune or Martin des Gobelins (because he was employed at the Gobelins Manufactory). He is said to have been the cousin or nephew of Jean-Baptiste Martin without evidences. He was the pupil of Adam Frans van der Meulen and Joseph Parrocel."
3106,"MARTINCOURT, Étienne","(b. ca. 1735, Paris, d. after 1791, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martinco/biograph.html,"
French bronze caster. Little is known about the life of Étienne Martincourt. Like many other bronze casters, he worked on the Right Bank of Paris, north of the Louvre, in a quarter that had been home to many bronze workers since the Middle Ages. After becoming a master in 1762, he was admitted to the Académie de Saint-Luc, a guild of decorative painters and sculptors. Membership in the guild of bronze casters and the Académie allowed Martincourt to design as well as to produce objects in gilt bronze. To do so without this dual membership would have brought stiff penalties from the guilds.



"
3107,"MARTINELLI, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1600, Montevarchi, d. 1659, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martinel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He had moved to Florence by 1621, and in 1623 is documented as living in the house of Jacopo Ligozzi. No works from this early period survive, and his first documented works were a fresco and other paintings (untraced) executed in 1622 for the church of S Leonardo at Grosseto. These were commissioned by Francesco dell'Antella (1567-1624), commander of the Order of Malta, who was a patron of Caravaggio during the latter's stay in Malta. Martinelli is not documented in Florence over the next ten years, and it is now widely accepted that he visited Rome in the latter part of the 1620s."
3108,"MARTÍNEZ, Jusepe","(b. 1600, Zaragoza, d. 1682, Zaragoza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martinez/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, engraver and writer. He was a son of the Flemish painter Daniel Martínez (d. 1636), with whom he first trained, following late Mannerist trends. In 1623 he went to Italy, and in 1625 he was in Rome, where he met Guido Reni, Domenichino and, shortly afterwards in Naples, Jusepe de Ribera. This contact with Italian classicism and naturalism influenced his work, and he always maintained a preference for classical balance and structure. He combined this with chromatic tones and a chiaroscuro that became progressively softer."
3109,"MARTINI, Pietro Antonio","(b. 1738, Trecasali, 1797, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martini/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver. He worked in Parma, in Paris, where he collaborated with Jacques-Philippe Le Bas, and in London. He engraved plates of historical subject matter, vistas and genre scenes, although the folder bearing his name in the British Museum's drawings and prints department barely contains a dozen work. The most noteworthy of these, owing to their size, ambition, and impact, are the engravings made of the Salons of the Louvre of 1785 and 1787, and on the Exhibition of the Royal Academy in London of 1787 and 1788. These four engravings are his most famous and considered his masterpieces."
3110,MARTINO DI BARTOLOMMEO,(active 1389-1435 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and manuscript illuminator (actually Martino di Bartolommeo di Biagio), the last Sienese master of the Trecento, to which his style can still be classified. From specific aspects of his early style, he is believed to have trained in the studio of Taddeo di Bartolo by whom was strongly influenced. As a young man Martino collaborated with Giovanni di Pietro da Napoli (active 1402-1405) in Pisa. His collaboration with Francesco da Valdambrino, amongst others, is documented."
3111,MARTINO DA MODENA,(active 1470-1489 in Modena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martinom/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. Martino di Giorgio d'Alemagna, called Martino da Modena is presumed to have been the son of Giorgio d'Alemagna, a German illuminator who is known to have worked at the ducal court of Leonello and then Borso d'Este in Ferrara from 1441 to 1479 and to have played a minor role, under the supervision of Taddeo Crivelli and Franco dei Russi, in the illumination of the Bible of Borso d'Este between 1455 and 1461. Martino, a prolific artist whose activity can be dated from 1470 to 1489, became one of the foremost illuminators of his generation."
3112,"MARTORELL, Bernat",(1400-1452),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martorel/biograph.html,"
Catalan painter and miniaturist. He worked in Barcelona and was the outstanding painter in Catalonia in the second quarter of the 15th century, the successor to Borrassá, who probably taught him. Only one surviving work is securely documented - the Altarpiece of St Peter of Pubol (Gerona Museum, 1437) - but on stylistic grounds a group of paintings formerly given to 'the Master of St George' has been attributed to him. The group includes (and formerly took its identity from) an altarpiece of St George; the central panel is in the Art Institute of Chicago and the four wings are in the Louvre. Martorell's work, influenced by Franco-Flemish painting and illumination, was essentially International Gothic in style, but reveals a highly distinctive personality, particularly in its vigorous sense of drama and delicate handling of light. Among the painters of the next generation Huguet was most obviously indebted to him.



"
3113,"MARTOS, Ivan Petrovich","(b. 1754, Ichnya, d. 1835, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martos/biograph.html,"
Ukrainian sculptor, active in Russia. He was the son of an impoverished landowner and studied at the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg from 1764 to 1773 under Louis Rolland (1711-91) and Nicolas-François Gillet. Between 1773 and 1779 Martos completed his education in Rome under Carlo Albacini (active 1770s-1800) and adopted the Neo-classical style. He returned to Russia in 1779 and began to teach in the sculpture class at the Academy of Arts, where, in 1794, he became Senior Professor and in 1814 Rector of Sculpture."
3114,"MARTSZEN, Jan the Younger","(b. ca. 1609, Haarlem, d. after 1647, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/martszen/biograph.html,"
Jan Martszen the Younger (Jan Martszen de Jonge), Dutch engraver and painter. He was the son of the Haarlem painter Jacobus Martens (1579/80-1647) and the nephew and pupil of Esaias van de Velde. He was active in Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft. He specialised in military skirmishes scenes and provided, during the 1630s and 1640s, a series of design for prints published in Amsterdam by Pieter Nolpe (1613/14-1652/3), sharing commissions at times with Pieter and Paulus Potter, Pieter Quast and Bartholomeus Breenbergh. He was the presumed master of Jan Asselyn, leading member of the 'second generation' of Dutch Italianate painters, who started as a battle painter.



"
3115,"MARVUGLIA, Giuseppe Venanzio","(b. 1729, Palermo, d. 1814, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marvugli/biograph.html,"
Italian architect of the late Baroque and early Classicism. He studied in Rome from 1747 to 1759, and won the second prize of the Accademia di San Luca competition in 1758. In 1759 he returned to Sicily with a Neoclassical education."
3116,"MARZAL DE SAX, Andrés",(active 1393-1410 in Valencia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marzal/biograph.html,"
Painter, probably of German origin (Sax indicating Saxony), who worked in Valencia. Only one fragment survives of his documented works - the Incredulity of St Thomas in Valencia Cathedral, part of an altarpiece he completed for the cathedral in 1400. Among the works given to him on stylistic grounds the most important is the huge and sumptuous retable of St George (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), featuring the varied tortures of the saint in grisly detail. The somewhat rough vigour of Marzal de Sax's style had considerable influence in Valencia; he is last mentioned in 1410, impoverished and ill, receiving free lodging from the city in recognition of the quality of his work and his generosity in training local painters.



"
3117,"MARZIALE, Marco",(active 1492-1507 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/marziale/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was first recorded in 1492 as one of several assistants to Giovanni Bellini in the Doge's Palace in Venice; in an inscription on his earliest known work, a damaged Virgin and Child with Saints and a Donor (1495; Zadar, St Mary, Treasury), he called himself a pupil of Gentile Bellini. Visual confirmation of his close association with both Bellini brothers is provided by the rather large number of his signed and dated works, many of which are closely based on compositional motifs by Giovanni, but which in their linearity and angularity more closely resemble the style of Gentile. The influence of German art, and of Dürer in particular, has often been noted in the sharply focused and densely packed details, the harsh modelling and the expressive ugliness found in much of Marziale's work.



"
3118,MASACCIO,"(b. 1401, San Giovanni Valdarno, d. 1428, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/masaccio/biograph.html,"
Masaccio (1401-1427?), the first great painter of the Italian Renaissance, whose innovations in the use of scientific perspective inaugurated the modern era in painting.
"
3119,"MASIP, Vicente","(b. ca. 1475, Andilla, d. 1550, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/masip/biograph.html,"
Vicente Masip (or Macip), Spanish painter, one of a dynasty of artists working in Valencia. Little is known of his life, but his major work, the main altarpiece of Segorbe Cathedral (completed 1535), shows him to have been a leading representative of the Italianate style. During his later years he collaborated with the outstanding member of the family, his son and follower Juan Vicente (better known as Juan de Juanes, c. 1523-79). Juan's work combines figures in the Italian Mannerist style with a polished Netherlandish technique. He was the leading painter of his time in Valencia and had many followers.



"
3120,MASO DI BANCO,(active 1320-50 in Firenze),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maso/biograph.html,"Florentine painter. Almost nothing is known of his career (Vasari does not mention him), but he is regarded as the greatest of Giotto's pupils and followers on the strength of Ghiberti's testimony that he was the painter of the frescoes illustrating the legend of St Sylvester in the Bardi Chapel of Santa Croce, Florence. Maso is mentioned in connection with the Bardi family in a document of 1341. It was a member of this family that provided for the foundation of a chapel bearing the family name. The Bardi di Vernio chapel in Sta. Croce was largely decorated by Maso di Banco. The frescoes representing five scenes from the legend of St Sylvester possess clarity of design and harmony of colour. The stately figures here are sometimes even more massive than Giotto's and the lucid and beautifully coloured compositions are of almost geometric clarity (although it has been argued that some of the effect of monumental simplicity may be due to restoration). The architectural settings and figures in the St Sylvester Resurrecting the Bull and Miracle of the Dragon anticipate the monumental style of Masaccio and Piero della Francesca.
"
3121,MASO DI BARTOLOMMEO,"(b. 1406, Capannole, d. ca. 1456, Dalmatia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maso_bar/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, one of the most respected bronze casters of his day. He was an indispensable collaborator on complex architectural projects. He is first recorded working with Donatello and Michelozzo between 1434 and 1438 on the installation and decorative relief-carving of the external pulpit of Prato Cathedral. From 1438 to 1442 he executed part of the bronze grille of the Cappella del Sacro Cingolo in the cathedral, until a dispute halted his work. It is gothicizing in style, with a pattern of delicate rosettes and elegantly twisted stems of naturalistic plant forms interspersed with animals and putti. In 1447 Maso made a gilded bronze reliquary inlaid with bone and tortoiseshell for the same chapel. It is decorated with a frieze of leaden putti dancing clumsily behind a colonnade and is ultimately derived from Donatello's Cantoria made for Florence Cathedral (Florence, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo)."
3122,MASOLINO da Panicale,"(b. 1400, Panicale, d. 1447, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/masolino/biograph.html,"Italian painter. He is generally considered to be a member of the Florentine School, but he travelled a good deal and even went to Hungary. His career is closely linked to that of Masaccio, but the exact nature of the association remains ill-defined. The tradition that he was Masaccio's master is now dismissed, for he became a guild member in Florence only in 1423 (a year after Masaccio) and although he was appreciably the older man it was he who was influenced by Masaccio rather than the other way round. They are thought to have collaborated on The Madonna and Child with St Anne (Uffizi, Florence, c. 1424), but the major undertaking on which they worked together was the decoration of the Brancacci Chapel of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. Masolino's style was softer than Masaccio's and there is a fair measure of agreement about the division of hands. Masolino's contributions, completed between 1424 and 1427, include The Preaching of St. Peter, The Raising of Tabitha, and The Fall of Adam and Eve.
"
3123,"MASSARI, Giorgio","(b. 1687, Venezia, d. 1766, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/massari/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. His eclectic style drew on both Palladio's Classicism and Baldassare Longhena's Baroque style."
3124,"MASSON, François","(b. 1745, Lyre, d. 1807, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/masson/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, the pupil of Guillaume Coustou II. He received his first lessons of drawing at the age of 17. Possibly his teachers were the monks of his village, the monks of the abbey of Quadrant. He continued his studies with Guillaume Coustou in Paris. He was patronized by Bishop Charles-François de Broglie, who brought him to Italy where he remained for five years. "
3125,"MASSOT, Firmin","(b. 1766, Geneve, d. 1849, Geneve)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/massot/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter, draughtsman and teacher. His first teacher was his sister, the portrait painter and engraver Pernette Massot (1761-1828). In 1788 Massot visited Rome with the painter Jean-Pierre Saint-Ours as a guide. On his return Massot was commissioned to produce several charcoal drawings, including two miniature portraits in profile (c. 1790; private collection), probably depicting two young women of the Chavanne family. From 1794, in order to escape the turbulence of the French Revolution he sought refuge at Coppet with Jacques Necker, former French Minister of Finance under Louis XIV, and his wife Suzanne, who introduced him to Lausanne society, where he established a new clientele."
3126,"MASSYS, Cornelis","(b. 1510, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1556, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/massys/cornelis/biograph.html,"

Painter, draughtsman and engraver, son of Quentin Massys. Like his elder brother Jan Massys, Cornelis was admitted to the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp in 1532, before reaching the age of majority. It is unlikely that he ever worked with his father or brother. Cornelis signed his works with three different monograms. Only one panel has survived bearing his first monogram COR. MET, used from 1537 to 1539: the Return of the Prodigal Son (1538; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). In it Cornelis emerges as a fine painter of imaginary landscapes in the manner of Joachim Patenier, but the figures are less successful and the composition somewhat stiff.



"
3127,"MASSYS, Jan","(b. ca. 1510, Antwerpen, d. 1575, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/massys/jan/biograph.html,"
Quentin Massys' two sons were artists. Jan, who became a master in the guild of Antwerp in 1531, was banished in 1543 for his heretical opinions, spent 15 years in Italy or France, and returned to Antwerp in 1558. His early pictures were imitations of his father's work, but a half-length Judith with the Head of Holofernes of a later date, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, shows Italian or French influence, as does Lot and His Daughters (1563; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna).

Cornelis Massys (1513-79), Quentin's second son, became a master painter in 1531, painting landscapes in his father's style and also executing engravings.




"
3128,"MASSYS, Quentin","(b. 1465/66, Leuven, d. 1530, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/massys/quentin/biograph.html,"
Quentin Massys (also spelled Matsys, Metsys, or Messys), Flemish artist, the first important painter of the Antwerp school. He was part of a Flemish family of artists, son of a Leuven blacksmith, Joost Massys (d. 1483), and his wife, Katharina van Kinckem. Joost Massys is known to have executed commissions for the new Leuven Stadhuis (1448–63), one of the most ornate town halls in the Netherlands, as well as other work for the Leuven authorities, and to have been superintendent of the chapel belonging to the Leuven metalsmiths’ Guild of St Eligius.

"
3129,MASTELLETTA,"(b. 1575, Bologna, d. 1655, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mastelle/biograph.html,"
Mastelletta (originally Giovanni Andrea Donducci), Italian painter. He trained under the Carracci, most notably Lodovico, but he also responded to the more expressive art of Pietro Faccini and Annibale Castelli. The spontaneity and freedom of his Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (Rome, Galleria Spada) emphasizes his closeness to these painters, while his Assumption of the Virgin (Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale) is closer to Ludovico Carracci's style, though with overtones of a Mannerist elegance that is characteristic of Mastelletta."
3130,MASTER of 1310,(active around 1310 in Pistoia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1310/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Pistoia at the beginning of the fourteenth century. His name is derived from an altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Child with Angels and Donators dated 1310 (now in the Musée du Petit Palais, Avignon)."
3131,MASTER of 1336,(active 1301-1350 in Pistoia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1336/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The artist takes his name from a fresco in Santa Maria delle Grazie, Pistoia, which was painted to give thanks for a miracle attributed to the Virgin Mary in the year 1336. Formerly he was named as the Master of Popiglio after a work formerly in the church of Popiglio and today in the Museo Civico in Pistoia."
3132,MASTER of 1416,(active early 15th century in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1416/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. This anonymous master takes his name from an altarpiece, signed 1416, depicting the Madonna and Child with Sts John the Baptist, Anthony Abbot, Julian and Peter, now in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence. A substantial body of work is associated with this master."
3133,MASTER of 1456,(active 1450s in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1456/biograph.html,"
German painter. He owes his name to the series of twenty-four panels detailing, in thirty episodes, the life of Saint Ursula in the Basilica of Saint Ursula, Cologne. The last panel, depicting the saint's martyrdom, is dated 1456. Ten other recorded panels are connected to this cycle due to stylistic similarities. Both series are also framed by a red band containing text. Further works comprised mainly of smaller panels for private devotion have enlarged the Master's corpus. All panels show the influence of Stefan Lochner."
3134,MASTER of 1477,(active 1470-1490 in Swabia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1477/biograph.html,"
German painter. He probably studied in the Low Countries or Rhenish Palatinate.



"
3135,MASTER of 1540s,(active 1540s in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/1540/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Name given by Friedländer to a painter of portraits bearing dates falling between 1541 and 1551. About thirty portraits dating to that decade have been ascribed to him. The identity of one of the sitters, Gillis van Schoonbeke, guardian of the Antwerp hospital, suggests that the artist was active in Antwerp. Compared with such painters as Anthonis Mor and Willem Key, the Master of the 1540s was probably a rather modest artist patronized by the upper middle classes. However, his works demonstrate great ability and considerable cultivation.



"
3136,MASTER of AB Monogram,(active 1530s in Saxony),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/ab/biograph.html,"
German painter. This unknown artist of Swabian origin was active in Saxony with close connections with Lucas Cranach's workshop. A series of six panels depicting Scenes from the Childhood of Jesus are attributed to this master who is also referred to as Monogrammist A. B.



"
3137,MASTER of AC Monogram,(second half of 16th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/ac/biograph.html,"
French master named after the signature found on a painting in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. This unknown master is also referred to as Monogrammist A. C.



"
3138,MASTER of the Acquavella Still-Life,(active 1610-20 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/acquavel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, considered the most important still-life painter working in Rome during the second and third decades of the seventeenth century. The master was named after the Still-life with a Basket of Fruit and a Vase of Flowers formerly with the Acquavella Gallery, New York, and subsequently in the Lorenzetti collection, Bergamo. Scholars have since identified a stylistically coherent group of still-life thought to be by the hand of this anonymous post-Caravaggesque master. The name-piece of the group was ascribed to Luca Forte, Angelo Caroselli, then Giovanni Battista Crescenzi.  More recently, the whole group of works has been assigned to Pietro Paolini, who trained in Rome in the workshop of Caroselli. These hypotheses remain unsubstantiated. Of the pictures in the group, compositions that combine figures with exuberant displays of fruit, vegetables and foliage are thought to be collaborations with Bartolomeo Cavarozzi. The anonymous master combined his astonishing powers of observation with Cavarozzi's compact figures.



"
3139,MASTER of the Acts of Mercy,(active 1460s in Salzburg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/acts/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, named after a set of panels depicting the six biblical acts of mercy and scenes from the martyrdoms of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence, around which a small oeuvre has been assembled. His localization in Salzburg is supported by the Nonnberg Crypt Altarpiece, putatively made for the Nonnberg Convent there.



"
3140,MASTER of the Aix-la-Chapelle Altarpiece,(active between 1480-1520 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/aix/biograph.html,"
German painter. He derives his name from the altarpiece (c. 1515-20) on the high altar of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) Cathedral. He is one of the severalidentifiable but anonymous minor masters working in Cologne.



"
3141,MASTER of the Aix Annunciation,(active in 1440s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/aix_annu/biograph.html,"
Painter active in France. He is named after a panel of the Annunciation (Aix-en-Provence, Ste Marie-Madeleine). The painting has been connected with a series of wills executed on behalf of the draper Pierre Corpici (b ?1388; d before ?1465), an inhabitant of Aix. In the earliest surviving will, dated 9 December 1442, known only from a copy made by Henri Requin (Labande), Corpici expressed a wish to be buried in Aix Cathedral and bequeathed 100 florins to pay for an altarpiece depicting the Annunciation or the Virgin Annunciate. The painting was to have a supercelo (crowning panel) and a scabelo (predella) and bear both the Corpici arms and the sign of his shop. Although not a contract, the will is quite specific regarding the subject-matter of the altarpiece. There is no mention, however, of it being a triptych with wings nor of the name of the artist who was to execute the work. On 5 January 1443, Corpici was granted permission by the cathedral chapter to construct an altar (destr. 1618), which was located to the right of the entrance of the west choir (built c. 1285-c. 1425). A further will of 14 July 1445 reiterates Corpici's desire to be buried in the cathedral; no reference is made to the altarpiece in this document, suggesting it was completed by this date. Further wills of 13 February 1449, 19 April 1458 and a final one of 8 November 1465 refer to the 'altar of the Annunciation', indicating that the altarpiece was installed by then."
3142,MASTER of the Albertini,(active 1310s in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/albertin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Master of the Casole Fresco. This anonymous Sienese painter takes his name from a detached fresco of the Virgin and Child Enthroned from the Albertini Chapel in Casole d'Elsa, near Siena, now in the museum of the Collegiata there. "
3143,MASTER of Alkmaar,(active c. 1500-1515 in Alkmaar),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/alkmaar/biograph.html,"
North Netherlandish painter. He was named after a polyptych of seven panels representing the Seven Acts of Mercy (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), commissioned by the Confraternity of the Holy Ghost in Alkmaar for the Laurenskerk. These panels are dated 1504 and signed with a monogram. The figure types and spacious settings are similar to works by the Haarlem painter Jan Mostaert, suggesting that the Master may have been trained in Mostaert's milieu c. 1475. Several other paintings dated between c. 1490 and c. 1510 are also attributed to this master on stylistic grounds."
3144,MASTER ALPAIS,(active 1180-1200 in Limoges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/alpais/biograph.html,"
French enameller active in Limoges. He received his name after the inscription on one of the most famous creations of the Limousin enamelleers, the ciborium in the Louvre.



"
3145,MASTER of the Annunciation to the Shepherds,(active 1630-1650 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/annuncia/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active  in Naples. His identity remains obscure and has given rise to a number of theories among art historians. The names of Bartolomeo Passante (1618-1648), a disciple of Ribera, Francanzano (c. 1605-1651), Giovanni Do (1617-1656), and others were proposed for identification. Although a body of works is now established, the debate is not yet over.



"
3146,MASTER of the Antwerp Adoration,(active 1500-1520 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/antwerp/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The conventional name derives from a triptych depicting the Adoration of the Magi (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp). The artist belongs to the group of the so-called Antwerp Mannerists. His oeuvre consists of small triptychs and panels, apparently for private devotion.



"
3147,MASTER ARNT of Kalkar,(active 1490-1492 in Kalkar and Zwolle),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/arnt/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish wood-carver. Master Arnt's activity in Kalkar is first recorded in 1460. He was one of the most important and original Lower Rhine sculptors from before 1500. He developed a personal style for the local market, and has an impressive oeuvre of more than 20 works. Four sculptures by him were formerly grouped under the name 'Master of the Kalkar Altar of St George' after the altar of St George in the church of St Nicholas in Kalkar.



"
3148,MASTER of the Avignon School,(middle of the 15th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/avignon/biograph.html,"
French painter. The name ""Master of the Avignon School"" denotes a painter - one of several anonymous painters - belonging to the Avignon School. "
3149,MASTER of Avila,(active in last quarter of 15th century in Avila),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/avila/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He painted a small triptych (c. 1470-75; Madrid, Museo Lázaro Galdiano), which shows on the interior the Nativity, the Annunciation to the Shepherds and the Magi's Vision of the Star; on the exterior is the Annunciation. The Master of Ávila may possibly have visited the Netherlands, because the painting is an adaptation of the Middleburg triptych of the Nativity (Berlin, Staatliche Museen) attributed to Rogier van der Weyden; Netherlandish influence is also apparent in the Virgin's draperies and the orange-yellows and reds in St Joseph's coat, which are typical of the Master of Flémalle."
3150,MASTER of Badia a Isola,(active c. 1290-1320),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/badia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. This anonymous artist, named after the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Two Angels in SS Salvatore e Cirino, Badia a Isola (near Monteriggioni, Siena), is a problematic figure. At the one extreme, the Badia a Isola panel and related works have been viewed as early works by Duccio di Buoninsegna; at the other, a much expanded corpus of works for the artist has been proposed. A number of critics agree in grouping a Virgin and Child (Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale, 593), a polyptych that once contained a St Paul, a St John the Evangelist and a St Peter (South Hadley, MA, Mount Holyoke College Art Museum), a St John the Baptist (Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, 608), a Virgin and Child (Utrecht, Catharijneconvent), a Redeemer and four Angels (untraced) and a Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Angels (Venice, Collezione Vittorio Cini), but other attributions are widely debated."
3151,MASTER of Balaam,(active 1440s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/balaam/biograph.html,"
German or Burgundian French engraver, who probably worked in either the Upper Rhine region or Burgundy. He is named after the engraving Balaam on his Ass and the Angel (Dresden, Kupferstichkabinet). Also attributed to him are some ten prints, each of which survives in a single example. Little is known about the artist's life. His prints are elegantly executed, showing that he had mastered the technique to perfection. This technical skill is undoubtedly due to his original profession: like many engravers of his time, he started life as a goldsmith. Most of the small, often circular engravings recall niello work and may have been preparatory sketches for goldsmiths.



"
3152,MASTER of the Bambino Vispo,(active 1420s in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bambino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, possibly identified as Starnina. A group of paintings were assembled under the name the Master of the Bambino Vispo. These included the Virgin and Child with Saints and Angels (Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence), the Virgin of Humility (Museum of Art, Philadelphia), a triptych of the Virgin and Child with Music-making Angels and Four Saints (Galleria Doria-Pamphili, Rome) and an altarpiece wing with Sts Mary Magdalene and Lawrence and a Cardinal Donor (Berlin, Bodemuseum). His name (Master of the Lively Child) was chosen on account of the particularly lively expression and movement of the Christ Child in the paintings. The altar wing was associated with a documented altarpiece of St Lawrence, which, it was then believed, had been donated to Florence Cathedral by Cardinal Pietro Corsini in 1422. This date provided the starting-point from which to relate the Master to other 15th-century Florentine painters."
3153,MASTER of the St. Bartholomew Altar,(active 1470-1510 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bartholo/biograph.html,"A German painter whose name derives from an altarpiece formerly in St Columba, Cologne, and now in Munich. Two other altarpieces by him are still in Cologne and probably date from c. 1500, although the St Bartholomew Altar itself is perhaps as late as 1510. The painter was probably a Cologne man, but his earliest works show the influence of the Netherlands, especially Roger van der Weyden and the school of Utrecht, so that it is sometimes suggested that he may have worked in Utrecht c. 1470. This influence is seen in a Virgin and Child With St Anne, now in Munich. His work is characterized by bright enamel-like colour. There are examples in Berlin, Brussels, London (National Gallery and Courtauld Institute) and Paris {Petit Palais and Louvre, based on Roger van der Weyden's Escorial Deposition).


"
3154,MASTER of the Duke of Bedford,(active 1405-1435 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bedford/biograph.html,"
Illuminator or workshop of illuminators and painters active in France. The name was first proposed in 1914 for the artist responsible for illuminating a Breviary and a Book of Hours for John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, English Regent in France from 1422 to 1435. The Book of Hours (London, British Library) with portraits of the Duke and his wife, Anne of Burgundy, who were married in 1423, was presented to King Henry VI of England in 1430. The unfinished Bedford or, from its liturgical use, Salisbury Breviary (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale) was begun c. 1424 (the start of the tables for computing Easter) and was still in progress in 1433, the year of the Duke's marriage to Jacquetta of Luxembourg, whose arms appear in the manuscript. These and a third manuscript, wrongly identified as a Pontifical (destroyed 1871 but published in the mid-19th century), are all richly illuminated in a similar style and all bear or bore the Duke's arms, badges and mottoes.



"
3155,MASTER of Bellaert,(active 1483-1487 in Haarlem),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bellaert/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish illustrator. He was named after Jacob Bellaert, an early Dutch publisher who produced seventeen books in Haarlem from 1483 to 1486. The unknown illustrator is so called for his many woodcuts in Bellaert's publications.



"
3156,MASTER of the Berswordt Altarpiece,(active 1390s in Westphalia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bersword/biograph.html,"
German painter. He takes his name from the Crucifixion Triptych in the Marienkirche, Dortmund, which bears the coat of arms of the Berswordt family. The only dated work by him is a dispersed retable of 1400 from the high altar of the Neustädter Marienkirche, Bielefeld. The artist's relationship to Konrad van Soest - whether as a predecessor or as a follower - is controversial, but most scholars now consider the Master of the Berswordt Altarpiece to be the earlier of the two and place his activity mainly in the final decade of the fourteenth century. A location of his workshop in Westphalia has long been postulated on the basis of the concentration of his commissions in that region.



"
3157,MASTER Bertram,"(b. ca. 1345, Minden, d. 1415, Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bertram/biograph.html,"
Master Bertram von Minden was a German painter working in Hamburg from 1367 to c.1415. The most important picture attributed to him is the Grabow Altar (c.1379/83, Hamburg, Kunsthalle). Others are in Hanover, Paris (Musée des Arts Décoratifs) and London (Victoria and Albert Museum). He was a precursor of the realistic Flemish approach of the 15th century, and also of the 'soft style', and he may have had some contact with Theodoric of Prague and with French art.



"
3158,MASTER of Bigallo,(active 1225-1255 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bigallo/biograph.html,"
Bigallo Master (Master of Bigallo), Italian painter, named after the Crucifix (c. 1225-30) now in the Bigallo Museum, Florence. This master's work shows the moderate plasticity and warm tones typical of much Florentine 13th-century painting. Certain stylistic features of the Bigallo Crucifix are similar to those found in the work of Berlinghiero Berlinghieri from Lucca, although perhaps too much attention has been paid to this. The painter's ability to keep up with developments in contemporary painting is shown by the reflection of Giunta Pisano's expressionism in another Crucifix (c. 1230-40; Art Institute, Chicago). The measured composition and breadth of plan in the dossal of St Zenobius, with four scenes from his life (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence), demonstrates the Master's competence as a narrative painter. Another painting attributed as a late work, a beautiful painted Crucifix (c. 1240s; Palazzo Barberini, Rome), documents the links between the Bigallo Master and contemporary painting in Umbria and Lazio.



"
3159,MASTER of the Blue Crucifixes,(active around 1250 in Umbria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bluecruc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was probably a collaborator of another anonymous master, the Master of the Borgo Crucifix. They probably trained in the workshop of Giunta Pisano and worked together in the same workshop, this explains the melding of their styles. Both masters were painters of the highest quality, excelling in an expressive and rhythmic linearity, and a subtle palette.

3160,MASTER of the Blue Jeans,(active 1680-1700 in Lombardy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/bluejean/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in the last decades of the seventeenth century in Lombardy. He was a mysterious and intriguing genre painter who specialized in portraying scenes of the poorer classes. The keen physical characterization and rather sketchy spatial conception of some of his earlier works point to the idea that the artist was not Italian. Despite the widely varied indications, there are few doubts that, at a certain point of his career, the artist settled in Lombardy."
3161,MASTER of the Borgo Crucifix,(active 1250-1270),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/borgo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Umbria, the Marches and Emilia Romagna. He was named after a Crucifix from Santa Maria in Borgo, Bologna (originally from San Francesco, Bologna, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna). It belongs with a group of works generally placed under the umbrella of the Master of the Franciscan Crucifixes, although more than one painter seems to have been involved."
3162,MASTER of the Hours of Maréchal de Boucicaut,(active 1405-1420 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/boucicau/biograph.html,"
Master of the Hours of Maréchal de Boucicaut, generally called the Boucicaut Master, was a Franco-Flemish illuminator. In the early 1400s, the Boucicaut Master was the leading master of manuscript illumination in Paris and one of the most influential artists working in the International style in northern Europe. The Boucicaut Master appears to have supervised a talented team of artists who produced manuscripts commissioned by the king of France, high-ranking aristocrats, and the wealthy bourgeoisie. He probably also made works sold on the open market. He produced illuminations of exceptional naturalism that capture the elegance and refinement of court taste. The name Boucicaut derives from the identification of his hand in a Book of Hours made for the Maréchal de Boucicaut, Jean le Meingre II, the marshal of France (Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris)."
3163,MASTER of the Brunswick Monogram,(active 1525-1550 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/brunswic/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter who was active in Antwerp and is named after a painting of the Parable of the Great Supper (Luke 14) in the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich Museum in Brunswick. It is signed with a monogram found only on this panel and apparently composed of the interlocked letters J, v, A, M, S and L. The identity of this master has been greatly disputed; there is no agreement as to how the interlinked letters of the monogram should be read."
3164,MASTER of Budapest,(active c. 1500 in Castile),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/budapest/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, also referred to as Budapest Master. He received his name after an altarpiece of which five panels are in the Szépmûvészeti Múzeum, Budapest. The style of this Castilian painter shows some Franco-Flemish characteristics.



"
3165,MASTER of the Burg Weiler Altarpiece,(active c. 1470 in Swabia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/burgweil/biograph.html,"
German painter active in Swabia. He is named after the triptych originally from the castle chapel in Weiler, near Heilbronn, and now in the Cloisters collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This artist was probably active in the northern reaches of Swabia, bordering Franconia, possibly with a workshop in Heilbronn.



"
3166,MASTER of Cabestany,(active 1130-1180),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/cabestan/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active in Italy, France and Spain. He is named after the tympanum representing the Assumption of the Virgin at Ste Marie, Cabestany (Roussillon). He worked in an idiosyncratic and expressive style, characterized by animated figures with stocky bodies, large hands and heads with distinctive features. His violent use of the drill is also characteristic of his work."
3167,MASTER of the Cassoni Campana,(active 1500-1525 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/cassoni/biograph.html,"
French or Italian painter named after four panels of a cassone purchased for the Louvre by Napoleon III from the collection of Giampietro Campana. He is also known as Master of Tavarnelle or Master of Ovid. It is assumed by some art historian that he was a pupil or collaborator of Filippino Lippi."
3168,MASTER of the Castello della Manta,(active 1410s in Piedmont),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/castell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter active in Piedmont. This anonymous painter received his name after the fifteenth-century Gothic frescoes in the Great Hall (Sala Baronale) in the Castello della Manta, near Saluzzo.



"
3169,MASTER of the Castello Nativity,(active in the mid-15th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/castello/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was named by Berenson (1913) after the Nativity (Galleria dell'Accademia) that came from the Medici villa at Castello. There are no datable works by the Master, but the earliest attributable works indicate stylistically that he was probably a pupil of Filippo Lippi and trained in his studio in Florence in the 1440s, before Lippi's move to Prato."
3170,MASTER of the Catholic Kings,(active 1485-1500 in Castile),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/catholic/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. The artist received his name after Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, called the ""Catholic Kings"" because of their religious zeal. A high quality altarpiece by this master painted for a church in Valladolid was probably commissioned by the Catholic Kings.



"
3171,MASTER of Saint Cecilia,(active 1300-20 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/cecilia/biograph.html,"Italian painter named after the St Cecilia Altarpiece in the Uffizi, which was originally in the church of Sta Cecilia, destroyed by fire in 1304. Presumably he was a Florentine, but nothing is known about him. Other works have been attributed to him because of their resemblance to the Uffizi picture, the most important being the three concluding scenes of the great fresco cycle of the Life of St Francis in the Upper Church of San Francesco at Assisi. The painter of these scenes resembles Giotto in lucidity of presentation and the solid drawing of his figures, but he is more genial in feeling. His figures are more vivacious, his colour warmer and sweeter. The completion of the great cycle in the Upper Church would have been entrusted only to an established master and some critics have attempted to identify the painter of these scenes and the St Cecilia Altarpiece with the famous but tantalizingly elusive Buffalmacco.


"
3172,MASTER of the Christ Church Coronation,(active 1350-1380 in Tuscany),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/christcc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The Master takes his name from a Coronation of the Virgin in the Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford. A catalogue of his oeuvre was first proposed by Offner, subsequently enlarged by Federico Zeri and further expanded by Boskovits. A triptych inscribed on the frame by the artist and dated 1373 was formerly at the Musée de la Bénédictine in Fécamp. It was the only known dated work."
3173,MASTER of Città di Castello,(active 1305-1320 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/citta/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is named after the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello), which may derive from a lost composition by Duccio di Buoninsegna. The painting is the earliest work of a corpus that also includes a dismembered polyptych of the Virgin and Child (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Siena) and SS Augustine, Paul, Peter and Anthony Abbot (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena); a polyptych of the Virgin and Child with SS Francis, John the Evangelist, Stephen and Chiara (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena); and a third altarpiece composed of a Virgin and Child (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen), St Peter and St John the Baptist (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), as well as a St Francis (private collection). A Virgin and Child in Detroit (Institute of Art, Detroit) is a closely related shop work."
3174,MASTER of the Clarisse Panel,(documented 1274-1281 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/clarisse/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was one of the leading artists during the second half of the thirteenth century. He received his name after the painting of Christ and the Virgin Enthroned in the Convento delle Clarisse, Siena. He has been identified as Rinaldo da Siena, painter of a Biccherna panel, but extrapolating from a single figure on a Biccherna panel is problematic and this identification is not generally accepted. However, whether or not the name Rinaldo is applicable, a coherent body of work has been attributed to this painter, including manuscript illuminations as well as panel paintings and frescoes. He was responsible for the frescoes of the Crucifixion and Deposition in the newly discovered undercroft or 'crypt', that was originally the atrium of the eastern entrance to Siena Cathedral.



"
3175,MASTER of the Codex of Saint George,(active first half of the 14th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/codex/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator and painter. His cognomen is derived from an illuminated Missal, known as the St George Codex (Rome, Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica). Until the early 1950s, he was thought to have been trained by a Sienese master, specifically, a follower of Simone Martini. The arguments centred around his association with Simone in Avignon and the importance of both artists for the development of the International Gothic style. Simone Martini's lost fresco of St George in Notre-Dame-des-Doms, Avignon, was considered to be the model for the St George Master's illustration on folio 85r of the Vatican manuscript: on that page, St George frees the Cappadocian princess in the margins of Cardinal Giacomo Stefaneschi's text on 'The Miracles and Martyrdom of St George'. Most scholars, however, now consider that the Master received his early training in Florentine art and that he was active in the first half of the 14th century, possibly as early as the first decade.



"
3176,MASTER of the Dominican Effigies,(active c. 1328–1350 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/dominica/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. At one time named after a polyptych in the Lee Collection (?1345; Courtauld Institute Galleries, London), he is now named after his most unusual panel, Christ and the Virgin Enthroned with Seventeen Dominican Saints (c. 1336; Santa Maria Novella, Florence). He has been identified with Ristoro di Andrea (active c. 1334-64) or some other illuminator associated with Santa Maria Novella, but this is unproven. It has also been suggested that the work of another illuminator, the Biadaiolo Master, may constitute an early phase of his career; if correct, this would reinforce his position as the chief heir to Pacino di Bonaguida, with whom he may have trained and certainly collaborated. Like Pacino, his work derives ultimately from the St Cecilia Master and forms part of what has been called the 'miniaturist tendency', a group of painters often associated with small-scale anecdotal narratives."
3177,MASTER of the Dresden Prayer Book,(active 1465-1515 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/dresden/biograph.html,"
Flemish illuminator and engraver, active in Bruges. He was named after the Book of Hours in Dresden (Dresden, Sächsische Landesbibliothek, MS. A311; two detached miniatures, Paris, Louvre, inv. no. 20694, 20694bis). The book was slightly damaged by water in 1945. Its format and composition are typical of Books of Hours produced in Bruges, but it differs in the illustration of the calendar, with 12 full-page miniatures of the occupations of the months. These miniatures show the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book to have been one of the first illuminators to capture differing moods and atmosphere in landscapes, for example a fresh May morning or a gathering storm on a hot day in July."
3178,MASTER of Eggenburg,(active 1475-1500 in Lower Austria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/eggenbur/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. A small painted oeuvre of this master was first established around the Death of the Virgin that was commissioned for the Lower Austrian Redemptoristenkloster in Eggenburg. His other extant paintings are from altarpieces devoted to St Wenceslas and to St John the Baptist. The master's origin are unknown. He may have assisted, or more likely, merely known the work of the Master of Herzogenburg, a late fifteenth-century painter from northern Lower Austria, who worked in 1491 in Gars am Kamp, Waldviertel.



"
3179,MASTER of Elsloo,(active 1510-1530 in Limburg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/elsloo/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish sculptor, or rather a workshop or a series of related satellite workshops. The workshop(s) produced a large number of surviving sculptures in the Limburg and Meuse region for a wide range of customers, several from England.



"
3180,MASTER E.S.,(active 1450-1467 Upper Rhine),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/es/biograph.html,"
German engraver working in the mid-15th century, named after the monogram on eighteen of his surviving prints. He is sometimes called the Master of 1466 from the date on one of his engravings."
3181,MASTER of Female Half-length,(active 1530-1540 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/female/biograph.html,"
South Netherlandish painter or group of painters. The name is given to what was apparently a large workshop that specialized in small-scale panels of aristocratic young ladies in half-length and devotional scenes: they are shown reading, writing or playing musical instruments, usually in a wood-panelled interior or against a neutral background. Some of the women are represented with an ointment jar, the attribute of Mary Magdalene.



"
3182,MASTER of Flémalle,"(b. ca. 1375, Valenciennes, d. 1444, Tournai)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/flemalle/biograph.html,"
Master of Flémalle Netherlandish painter named after three paintings in the Städelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt that were wrongly supposed to have come from Flémalle, near Liège. There is a strong consensus of scholarly opinion that he is to be identified with Robert Campin (active 1406-44), who was the leading painter of his day in Tournai but none of whose documented pictures survive. The identification depends on the similarity between the Master of Flémalle's paintings and those of Jacques Daret and Rogier van der Weyden, for Daret was Campin's pupil and Rogier almost certainly was. The hypothesis that the Master of Flémalle's paintings are early works by Rogier now has few adherents. 
"
3183,MASTER of Flora,(active 1555-1570 in France),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/flora/biograph.html,"
Painter, active in France. Grouped under this name are a small number of paintings and drawings executed by an artist probably of Italian origin who is known to have worked in France between 1555 and 1570. A painting representing Flora (private collection) has given its name to this remarkable heir to the first Fontainebleau school. Together with this painting, three other works permit a firm appreciation of the personality and style of the Master: the Triumph of Flora (private collection, Vicenza), which is considered to be a workshop production; the Birth of Cupid (New York, Metropolitan Museum); and the Allegory of Abundance (Ravenna, Accademia). All these works show strong affinities with the style of Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio and also with that of Nicolo dell'Abate, who arrived in Fontainebleau in 1552."
3184,MASTER of the Fontainebleau School,(second half of the 16th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/fontaine/biograph.html,"
""Master of the Fontainebleau School"" denotes a French or Italian artist belonging to the School of Fontainebleau (École de Fontainebleau)."
3185,MASTER of St Francis,(active c. 1260-1280 in Umbria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/francis/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. This painter of frescoes and panels and, perhaps, designer of stained glass in the district around Perugia was named by Thode after a panel of St Francis with Angels in S Maria degli Angeli, Assisi. Much of the work attributed to him was part of the early phase in the decoration of S Francesco, Assisi, and includes the fresco cycle in the nave of the Lower Church with five scenes from the Passion on the right wall and five scenes from the Life of St Francis on the left. (These were damaged by the later opening of the side chapels.) In spite of the obvious participation of assistants, the entire cycle seems to have been planned by a single artist and can be considered as homogeneous and characteristic of his style. This was largely based on the later works of Giunta Pisano but also shows the influence of such Umbrian artists as Rainaldetto di Ranuccio, Simeone and Machilone and of contemporary manuscript illumination, for example the Gospel Book of Giovanni da Gaibena (Padua, Biblioteca Capitolare). The Master of St Francis embodies an important aspect of the contact between Italian and Byzantine art of this period: Byzantine elements, particularly of iconography, are found with western forms of ornamentation and a use of colour that is far from Byzantine.



"
3186,MASTER FRANCKE,"(early 15th century, active in Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/francke/biograph.html,"German painter, active in Hamburg. His major surviving work is an altarpiece for the guild of merchants trading with England (Kunsthalle, Hamburg, 1424). showing Passion scenes and incidents from the life of St Thomas à Becket. Francke was a leader of the northern German version of International Gothic. He had close links with the west and Burgundy in particular. His influence was widely spread over north Germany and along the shores of the Baltic.



"
3187,MASTER of Frankfurt,"(b. 1460, d. 1533, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/frankfur/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp between 1490 and 1520. The date of his birth has been established on the basis of an inscription on the frame of the Self-Portrait with the Artist's Wife (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp), in which the artist recorded the date of execution and his age at that date."
3188,MASTER FVB,(active 1475-1500 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/fvb/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish engraver who signed his prints with the monogram FVB. He was the first artistic personalities in Flemish printmaking with a clearly recognizable, individual style. A total 59 engravings have been attributed to him (religious scenes, a few ornament prints and two genre pieces). He was familiar with the prints of Martin Schongauer, the leading engraver of the period, and made copies of several of them. He also knew the paintings of Dieric Bouts, Hans Memling and Rogier van der Weyden.


"
3189,MASTER of the Registrum Gregorii,(active c. 972-1000),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/gregorii/biograph.html,"
German (Ottonian) illuminator, also known as the Gregory Master. He is named after two detached leaves of a manuscript of the Registrum Gregorii (Ms. 171, Stadtbibliothek, Trier and Ms. 14bis, Musée Condé, Chantilly) given by Egbert, Archbishop of Trier, to Trier Cathedral. Work in a group of late 10th-century codices, most of them produced for churches in Trier between 980 and 996, is also attributed to this artist. A Sacramentary made for Lorsch Abbey, perhaps c. 980 (Ms. 1447, Musée Condé, Chantilly), may be among his earliest works, while his last known work is a Gospel Book in Manchester (Ms. 98, John Rylands University Library). Its miniatures are now missing but are attributed to the Gregory Master on the grounds of the full-page incipits to the Gospels, characteristically laid out with medallions of emperors in square frames in the borders. Since Otto III is portrayed as an emperor, the manuscript cannot have been produced before 996, the date of his imperial coronation."
3190,MASTER of the Story of Griselda,(active 1490s in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/griselda/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was named after a set of three spalliera panels (National Gallery, London) devoted to Boccaccio's story of Patient Griselda (Decameron, X.10). They had been assigned to Pinturicchio, and the Master's style is rightly linked to Umbria, although he was active chiefly in Siena. The tall, spindly figures on the panels show vibrant movement and are dressed in elegant costumes, despite their crude, sticklike, sketchy execution. The artist's personality was established by the discovery of the same hand at work in small background scenes in a set of panels of single figures standing on pedestals with landscape backgrounds. Eight panels of the set by various artists have been identified. Four of the panels are by Sienese painters: Matteo di Giovanni's Judith (University Art Museum, Bloomington); Neroccio de' Landi's Claudia Quinta (National Gallery of Art, Washington); Francesco di Giorgio's Scipio Africanus (Bargello, Florence); and Pietro Orioli's Sulpicia (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore). The other four were first attributed to Signorelli but now are given by consensus to an artist dependent on him, plausibly considered to be the Griselda Master himself: Artemisia (Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan); Eunostos (National Gallery of Art, Washington); Alexander (Barber Institute, University of Birmingham); and Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest). Though more suave and sculptural, the main figures share the smaller ones' finicky, dancer-like refinement."
3191,MASTER of the View of Ste Gudule,(active c. 1480 in Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/gudule/biograph.html,"
South Netherlandish painter. This name was given to the painter of the 'Pastoral Sermon' (St Géry Preaching; Musée du Louvre, Paris), which includes a view of the cathedral of Ste Gudule in Brussels. The north tower is shown as unfinished, suggesting that the work was painted before 1480, a date confirmed by the style of dress. Other works attributed to the Master include: the Virgin and Child with St Mary Magdalene and a Female Donor (c. 1475-80; Museum of Religious Art and Mosan Art, Liège), which shows the influence of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden in its composition; the Clothing of the Beggars (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid) and the Liberation of the Prisoners (Musée Cluny, Paris), two panels from a series on the theme of mercy; the Portrait of a Young Man (National Gallery, London), with the portal of Notre-Dame-du-Sablon in Brussels in the background; and the Marriage of the Virgin (Catherijneconvent, Utrecht). Several of these show the painter's interest in architecture and the buildings of Brussels, particularly those in Brabantine Gothic style.



"
3192,MASTER of the Habsburgs,(active 1490-1520 in Tyrol),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/habsburg/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He is named from a panel painting of the Adoration of the Magi in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna.



"
3193,MASTER of the Hartford Still-life,(active c. 1600 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/hartford/biograph.html,"The artist was named in 1952 after the Still-life with Flowers and Fruit in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. Since then a number of identifications have been made, including Francesco Zucchi, Bernardino Cesari and Giovanni Battista Crescenzi. The identity of this enigmatic master remains uncertain: if the proposition that he is the young Caravaggio is reconcilable, he may be a painter close to him. Two pictures in the collection of the Galleria Borghese, one a Still-life with Birds, the other Flowers, Fruit, Vegetables and Two Lizards, have been linked to the Master of the Hartford Still-life because of their stylistic similarities and shared early provenance.

"
3194,MASTER of the Housebook,(active 1475-90 in Mainz),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/hausbuch/biograph.html,"
Master of the Housebook (or Meister des Hausbuchs) was a Rhenish or Dutch painter, draughtsman, and engraver active in the last quarter of the 15th century. He is named from a series of drawings in the so-called Hausbuch in Schloss Wolfegg in south-west Germany; many of the drawings show scenes of everyday life and so do the engravings (about ninety are known) attributed to him. By far the best collection of the engravings is in Amsterdam Print Room, and he was therefore once known as the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet. Because of this, and because he seems to fit into the Bosch-Bruegel tradition, he is often thought to have been Dutch and various identifications have been suggested: the latest is Erhard Reuwich, who worked on the Middle Rhine c. 1480. A few paintings are also ascribed to the Housebook Master, including the Pair of Lovers (Gotha) and one in Mainz, dated 1505, but perhaps finished by another hand. Other paintings are in Berlin and Frankfurt (Städel), but his work as an engraver was historically far more important.



"
3195,MASTER of Heiligenkreuz,(active in the early 1400s in Austria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/heiligen/biograph.html,"
This artist derived his name from a diptych that once belonged to the Cistercian Abbey of Heiligenkreuz, located in southeastern Austria. His nationality is uncertain, he was most probably trained in France but active in Austria."
3196,MASTER H.L.,(active c. 1515-1526 in Upper Rhine),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/hl/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, engraver and wood-carver. He is known by the initials with which he signed a carved altarpiece (1523-26; Breisach, Cathedral), twenty-four engravings and seven woodcuts.



"
3197,MASTER of Hohenfurth,(active 1350-70 in Prague),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/hohenfur/biograph.html,"
Master of Hohenfurth (or of Vyssi Brod), Bohemian painter, so called after his main work, a large altarpiece with scenes from the life of Christ (National Gallery, Prague, c.1350) painted for the monastery of Vyssi Brod (Hohenfurth). These panels show the beginnings of the Bohemian variant of International Gothic. Another important painting from his workship, a Death of the Virgin, is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.



"
3198,MASTER of the Holy Blood,(active c. 1530 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/holybloo/biograph.html,"
South Netherlandish painter. The name was given to the anonymous painter of the triptych of the Lamentation (Bruges, Museum Heilige Bloed) that belonged to the Bruges Brotherhood of the Holy Blood. Friedländer attributed 30 works to the Master, whom he characterized as a competent but unassuming practitioner, active in Bruges c. 1530. The paintings also show strong Antwerp influence, but the Lamentation triptych and that of the Glorification of the Virgin (Bruges, St Jacobskerk), both of which belong to the group of attributed works, have always been in Bruges, thus supporting the idea that the studio of the Master was there. The paintings also show affinities with the works of Gerard David, Albert Cornelis, Ambrosius Benson and Jan Provoost, who were also active in Bruges. According to Friedländer, the absence of donor portraits in the triptychs indicates that they were not made on commission but were produced for the open market, presumably for export.



"
3199,MASTER of the Holy Kinship,(active 1480-1518 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/holykins/biograph.html,"
German painter. He is named after an altarpiece depicting the Holy Kinship (c. 1500-03; Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Mus., ex-Dominican Kloster St Achatius). In this assembly of the relatives of the Virgin, a central group with St Anne and the Infant Jesus is flanked by SS Barbara and Catherine, the latter depicted as the Mystic Bride of Christ. On the inner sides of the wings, in front of a broad landscape, are (left) SS Roch and Nikasius with the donor, Nikasius Hackeney, and (right) SS Gudula and Elizabeth with his wife Christina. Here the Master's art is at its zenith. Solid bourgeois comfort and steadiness characterize the figures. The composition of the triptych is, as with most of his work, unassuming. However, it is pervaded by a sensitivity to colour values, shades of red being dominant."
3200,MASTER HONORÉ,(active 1285-1315 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/honore/biograph.html,"
French illuminator. In 1296 a certain Honoré is named in the inventory of the Louvre treasury as the master of the Breviary of Philip the Fair. The master is also listed as a house-owner in Parisian tax records of 1293. The amount of tax he had to pay suggests that he must have run a large workshop. By 1318 he must have been dead for a while, as his son-in-law Richard de Verdun was already established as head of the workshop."
3201,MASTER of Hoogstraeten,(active c. 1490-1530),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/hoogstra/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He is named after a series of seven panels of the Sorrows of the Virgin (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp), which were in the church of St Catherine, Hoogstraten, until 1825, and which were possibly painted for it c. 1505. Volskaja identified the artist as one of Memling's pupils at Bruges, Passcier van der Mersch (d c. 1500), although Gerard David seems a closer source of inspiration for the Master, and this in turn might support the suggestions by Hoogewerff and Châtelet that he was of Dutch origin. Other works by the Master include the Adoration of the Magi formerly in the Johnson Collection (Museum of Art, Philadelphia), which has similar figures with pale faces, long fingers and noses shown in incorrect profile.



"
3202,MASTER IAM of Zwolle,(active 1470-1495 in Zwolle),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/iam/biograph.html,"
North Netherlandish engraver. The master, whose prints are signed with the monogram IA or IAM and usually the place name Zwoll(e), was the most original 15th-century engraver in the northern Netherlands. The maker's mark, which is worked into the monogram on a number of prints, makes the identification with the painter Jan van den Mijnnesten (d. 1504) very likely; the latter was frequently recorded in Zwolle between 1462 and 1504, but none of his works is known. Many of the Master's prints include the sign of a drill that was used for working on silver: this may indicate that they were engraved by a goldsmith after the painter's designs.



"
3203,MASTER I.P.,(active 1520s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/ip/biograph.html,"
Bavarian or Austrian wood-carver. He was one of a group of carvers active in Salzburg, Passau and Prague who made small, elegant, highly refined reliefs in boxwood, limewood and pearwood. These items were in many ways a northern counterpart to the small bronze statuettes produced in Italy for wealthy private collectors. The Master of Irrsdorf, the earliest of the group, has sometimes been identified with Master I.P.; it was also suggested that he be identified as J. Pocksberg."
3204,MASTER of the Isaac Stories,(active 1290s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/isaac/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His name is derived from the frescoes depicting Isaac Blessing Jacob and Isaac and Esau in the Upper Church of San Francesco, Assisi; the frescoes occupy the middle register of the third bay from the crossing on the north wall of the nave. By assigning these scenes to the young Florentine Giotto, Thode (1885) sparked the controversy over the identity and origin of the Isaac Master. Subsequent attempts to identify him with either the Roman artist Pietro Cavallini or with another Florentine, Gaddo di Zanobi Gaddi, have been unpersuasive. Present consensus is divided between scholars accepting the attribution to Giotto and those advocating that the Isaac Master came from Rome, where he had absorbed the art of Cavallini. Iconographic and stylistic details in the Isaac Master's frescoes attest to his Roman background.



"
3205,MASTER of the Joseph Sequence,(active around 1500 in Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/joseph/biograph.html,"
South Netherlandish painter. He was named in 1923 after a series of tondi illustrating the Legend of St Joseph (Berlin, Bodemuseum; Munich, Alte Pinakothek; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art). Subsequently eight panels with scenes from the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin (c. 1493-1508; Brussels, Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts) were also attributed to the same painter. These came from the abbey of Afflighem and gave the artist his alternative name (Master of Afflighem Abbey). The inscription TE BRUESELE on the Circumcision, the buildings and the style of painting suggest that the artist worked in Brussels c. 1500. The portraits of Philip the Fair and Joanna the Mad on the wings of the Last Judgement triptych from Zierickzee (c. 1496-1506; Brussels, Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts) and the wings of the Legend of St Barbara (Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery) are also attributed to this artist.



"
3206,MASTER of the Lazzaroni Madonna,(active 1375-1400 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/lazzaron/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a former pupil of Jacopo di Cione, active in the region around Florence. "
3207,MASTER of the Legend of Saint Barbara,(active 1470-1500 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/legen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman. The name was given by Friedländer to the artist of a panel, now divided in two, illustrating the Legend of St Barbara (c. 1475; Musée du Saint-Sang, Bruges; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels). The panel belonged to an altarpiece which may have originally been constructed as a triptych or possibly a polyptych, though only two panels are extant. The altarpiece had already been broken apart by that time. Two drawings by the Master for this work survive (Musée du Louvre; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The rather perfunctory treatment of the modelling in the panel indicates that it was probably executed with an assistant."
3208,MASTER of the Legend of Saint Catherine,(active 1470-1500 in Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/legend/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The name was given by Friedländer to the painter of a panel illustrating scenes from the Legend of St Catherine (pivate collection, Brussels). The Master's narrative compositions combine the anecdotal with the expressive, and his style is a stereotyped version of that of Rogier van der Weyden. Faces are narrow with large, high-set ears, elongated eyes with vacant expressions and long noses. The Master shows a pronounced taste for architectural representations, and greyhounds and griffins appear frequently in his works. The evident links with the work of Rogier van der Weyden have led Friedländer and subsequent art historians to identify the Master as Rogier's son Pieter, who continued to run his father's studio. Some of the compositions and landscapes, however, are reminiscent of those used by the Bruges school of painting."
3209,MASTER of the Legend of St. Ursula,(active 1480-1500 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/legend1/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The artist was named by Friedländer after the altarpiece of eight panels illustrating the Legend of St Ursula, with two additional panels showing The Church and The Synagogue (before 1482; all Bruges, Groeninge Museum), formerly in the convent of the Augustinian Black Sisters in Bruges. Among several surviving portraits, the Portrait of a Donor (c. 1479; Philadelphia, Museum of Art) apparently portrays Lodovico Portinari; it was originally part of a diptych, accompanied by a Virgin and Child (Cambridge, Fogg Art Museum). Among important surviving works, the Virgin and Child with Three Donors (Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten) is dated 1486."
3210,MASTER of the Legend of Saint Ursula (II),(active 1480-1520 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/legend2/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Cologne. He stands out among the Late Gothic painters of Cologne through his uncommon colouristic talent. His work is now distinctly separated from that of the Master of St Severin, to whom it was formerly attributed. He is named after a cycle of 19 known oil paintings depicting the Legend of St Ursula (1492-96; Landesmuseum, Bonn; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne; Erzbischöfliches Diözesanmuseum, Cologne; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Musée du Louvre, Paris, and others). Although eight paintings were in St Severin, Cologne, until 1880, it is thought that the former parish church of St Brigid was the cycle's original location."
3211,MASTER of the Legend of Saint Lucy,(active c. 1480-1510 in Bruges),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/legend3/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman. This name was coined to identify the artist responsible for a group of paintings linked stylistically to the panel of the Legend of St Lucy (1480; Bruges, St Jacob). Some 45 to 50 paintings are associated with this master, although variations among them suggest workshop participation in certain cases. Some silverpoint drawings have also been attributed to him. Depictions of the city of Bruges in the background of some of his paintings record changes in the belfry, which was being remodeled from 1483 to c. 1502. Four distinct forms of the belfry are recorded in them, and on this and the stylistic evidence of the paintings themselves a chronology for the artist's works was proposed. The Virgin among Holy Women (Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels), dated to c. 1490, typifies his mature style: ponderous figures occupy a shallow space near the picture plane in a static, symmetrical composition with lush foliage and brocaded garments that display a detailed rendering of surface textures characteristic of 15th-century Netherlandish art."
3212,MASTER of the Life of the Virgin,(active 1463-1480 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/life/biograph.html,"Master of the Life of the Virgin (Master of the Life of Mary, Meister des Marienlebens), German painter, named after a series of eight panels illustrating the Life of the Virgin, of which the Presentation in the Temple is in the National Gallery, London, and the remainder in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. He was one of the outstanding Cologne painters of his time, and his affinities with Dieric Bouts and Rogier van der Weyden suggest that he trained in the Netherlands. None of the pictures attributed to him is dated, but a Crucifixion in the hospital church at Cues on the Moselle, generally accepted as his work, is probably from 1465. The Master of the Lyversberg Passion may be identical with him, while the Master of Werden is probably only an aspect of his studio.



"
3213,MASTER of the Life of Saint John the Baptist,(active 1325-1350 in Rimini),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/life_bap/biograph.html,"
Italian painter from Rimini. The artist's name is derived from a large altarpiece, dismembered and dispersed in several museums, which depicted scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in at least eight panels flanking a central image of the Virgin with the Child.



"
3214,MASTER of the Lille Adoration,(active 1510-1530 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/lille/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp. The anonymous artist was named after an Adoration of the Shepherds in Lille. This painting was previously attributed, as were other paintings by the same hand, to Dirck Vellert. This subject was popular in Antwerp, where similar treatments of it emanated from a variety of different workshops.



"
3215,MASTER of the Lyversberg Passion,(active 1460-1490 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/lyversbe/biograph.html,"
A German painter responsible for a Passion series (now in Cologne), which was at one time thought to be the work of the Master of the Life of Mary. The relationship between the two masters is very close indeed, but is not necessarily that of identity.



"
3216,MASTER OF MAGDALEN,(active c. 1265-1290 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/magdalen/biograph.html,"
Magdalen Master (Master of Magdalen or Maestro della Maddalena) was an Italian painter. One of the most influential artists in 13th-century Florence, he was named by Sirén (1922) after a panel showing a standing figure of St Mary Magdalen flanked by eight small scenes from her life (Florence, Accademia). Sirén first attributed three pictures of the Virgin and Child (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie; S Michele in Rovezzano, nr Florence; Arezzo, Museum of Medieval and Modern Art) to this Master and emphasized the apparent influence of Coppo di Marcovaldo. In 1926 he added another group of paintings to the Magdalen Master's oeuvre, including the altarpiece of the Virgin Enthroned between SS Andrew and James (Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs). This, one of the painter's most beautiful and important works, had already been linked by Toesca to the panel in the Accademia. Offner (1927) identified other early works, such as the dossal of the Virgin and Child Enthroned between SS Leonard and Peter (New Haven, CT, Yale University Art Gallery) and the tabernacle showing the Virgin and Child Enthroned with SS Peter and Paul (New York, Metropolitain).



"
3217,MASTER of the Munich Marian Panels,(active mid-15th century in Bavaria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/marian/biograph.html,"
German painter named after the Annunciation and Nativity wing panels now in the Kunsthaus Zürich, which probably belonged to a Crucifixion altarpiece whose central panel (itself attributed to a collaborator) is in the Frauenkirche, Munich) The putative location of his workshop in Munich is supported by stylistic similarities between his paintings and the contemporary work of the Master of the Polling Panels, who counted among his patrons Duke Albrecht III of Bavaria-Munich. He appears to have traveled in Italy.



"
3218,MASTER of Marradi,(active 1490s in Tuscany),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/marradi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Master of Marradi is the name given to a prolific artist active in Tuscany in the late 15th century whose work owes much to Domenico Ghirlandaio. A group of four panels by him are located in the Badia del Borgo in Marradi. He is also named as Master of the Apollini Sacrum after a painting representing A Tribute to Apollo.



"
3219,MASTER of Mary of Burgundy,(active 1469-1483 in Ghent),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/mary/biograph.html,"
Flemish illuminator, painter and draughtsman. The anonymous painter known as the Master of Mary of Burgundy was one of the most talented and inventive of Flemish illuminators. Deeply influenced by the leading painters from Ghent, especially Hugo van der Goes, he introduced to the pages of books a new subtlety and richness in the depiction of light and colour and an emotional expressiveness rivaled only by the art of van der Goes. The art of the Ghent-Bruges school originated in his illumination, and his iconographic and formal innovations remained influential for several generations. "
3220,MASTER of the Mascoli Altar,(active 1425-50),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/mascoli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His name is derived from the marble altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with Sts Mark and James in the Mascoli Chapel, San Marco, Venice. An inscription above the altar dates the foundation of the chapel to 1430, and both the figures and the architectural frame of the altar were probably commissioned at that time. Most authors also attribute the relief of the Virgin and Child with Two Angels over the exterior portal of the Corner Chapel (after October 1422) in Santa Maria dei Frari, Venice, to the Master of the Mascoli Altar. In both works the tightly pulled drapery reveals the lines of the body, accenting the pose and movement of the figures; the rather conventional Gothic frames were probably designed and executed by Venetian masons. It appears that the three sections of the Corner Chapel relief and also the figures for the Mascoli Chapel were adapted to fit into their respective frames, suggesting that the carvings did not originate in Venice but were imported and inserted into existing frames.



"
3221,MASTER MATEO,(active 1161-1217),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/mateo/biograph.html,"
Mateo de Compostela, Spanish Romanesque sculptor and architect responsible for the Portico de la Gloria, signed and dated 1188, at the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. A huge composition featuring a triple doorway, this is the greatest work of Spanish sculpture of this period.



"
3222,MASTER of Monte Oliveto,(active 1305-1335 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/monte/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, named after a Maestà in the monastery of Monteoliveto Maggiore, south of Siena. He was active in the provinces of Siena in the second and third decades of the century."
3223,MASTER of Moulins,(active 1480-1500),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/moulins/biograph.html,"French painter, named after a triprych in Moulins Cathedral representing the Madonna with Saints and Donors and datable c. 1498. The style of this work is quite distinctive, and has enabled a considerable oeuvre to be built up around it. The Master of Moulins' sculptural precision of form (recalling Fouquet), the poise of his individual figures, his brilliant palette, the harmony of his compositions, and his taste for splendid and meticulous details make him one of the outstanding painters of his period in northern Europe. Various attempts have been made to identify the Master of Moulins with named artists (for example Jean Perréal and Jean Hey), but none has met with general acceptance.



"
3224,MASTER M S,(16th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/ms/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter from a mining town. Only six of his pictures are known which used to decorate the high altar of the Roman Catholic church in Selmecbánya. The initials and the date (1506) became visible after they were restored at the beginning of the 20th century. Little is known about the painter's person, a major representative of medieval Hungarian art. German art historians generally identify him with J. Brieu, a painter from Augsburg, disregarding the results of research done by Hungarian experts. The anonymous master is very likely to have been a painter called Sebestyén, whose name is mentioned in the charter of Selmecbánya in 1507. Research carried out so far appears to prove that he must have been identical with M.S. Master. His art combining dramatic depth and colourful decorative formation is akin to that of Dürer and mostly Grünewald.


"
3225,MASTER M Z,(active 1500-1510),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/mz/biograph.html,"
German engraver. Twenty-two engravings are signed with the initials MZ, six of them dated (1500, 1501, 1503). In the absence of appreciable stylistic or technical development and because the artist's sources - Albrecht Dürer's prints from the 1490s in particular - are no later than the dated prints, it is thought that all the production was concentrated c. 1500. The prints are equally divided between religious and secular subjects. Often a state of disquiet inhabits the figures, accompanied by eccentric use of perspective and abrupt changes in scale, as seen for example in The Embrace and Solomon's Idolatry. Most of his works have landscape backgrounds executed with a delicate, atmospheric touch that suggests a precursor of Albrecht Altdorfer and other painters of the Danube school."
3226,MASTER of the Osservanza,(active 1430-1450 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/osservan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Longhi recognized that two triptychs, formerly attributed to Sassetta, were the work of another hand. The Virgin and Child with SS Jerome and Ambrose (Siena, Osservanza) and the Birth of the Virgin (Asciano, Museo d'Arte Sacra), formerly in the Collegiata, Asciano, both have a stylistic affinity with Sassetta's works but, in terms of narrative expression, still belong to the Late Gothic tradition. Longhi observed that a further group of paintings was closely related to these works. This included the predella of the Osservanza Altarpiece (Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale), a predella of St Bartholomew (Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale), scenes of the Passion (Rome, Pinacoteca Vaticana; Philadelphia, Museum of Art; Cambridge, Fogg Museum) and the scenes from the Life of St Anthony Abbot (dispersed; e.g. panels in Washington, National Gallery of Art; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art; Wiesbaden, Museum Wiesbaden) previously also attributed to Sassetta. These last panels are difficult to integrate into the group. The full-length painting of St Anthony Abbot (Paris, Louvre), which scholars have attempted to integrate with the small scenes from the saint's life into a multipartite altarpiece, seems to come from another altarpiece.



"
3227,MASTER of the Palazzo Venezia Madonna,(active around 1350 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/palazzo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, who takes his name from the Virgin and Child once in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome and now in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in the Palazzo Barberini. He was a close follower of Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi, in whose workshop he may have trained. His style was particularly close to Memmi's. He was a collaborator of Bartolomeo Bulgarini."
3228,MASTER of the Parrot,(active 1525-50 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/parrot/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp. A painter of figures and religious compositions, this anonymous master from Antwerp who worked during the first half of the 16th century, was given this name by M. J. Friedländer owing to the parrot which - although it does not have the value of a signature - features in several of his paintings of the Madonna, where the Child is playing with the bird."
3229,MASTER PAUL of Lõcse,(active 1500-1520 in Upper Hungary),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/paul/biograph.html,"
The Hungarian Master Paul of Lőcse was the pupil of Veit Stoss, the sculptor of the St Mary altarpiece in Cracow. Works from his workshop are to be found at every step in the counties of Szepes and Liptó in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia). At Lőcse (Levoča in Slovakia), in the church of St. James's alone, there are five altars from the same source, besides the equestrian statue of St. George. The Altarpiece of St James is the largest and most valuable creation of the workshop, it can be compared with the best European winged altars.



"
3230,MASTER of the Pesaro Crucifix,(active 1380-1400 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/pesaro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice. The Master takes his name from the Crucifix painted for the Seminario in Pesaro.



"
3231,MASTER of the Pfullendorf Altar,(active c. 1500),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/pfullend/biograph.html,"
German painter. He is named after a double-winged altarpiece (c. 1500), supposedly from the parish church at Pfullendorf, of which eight panels of the Life of the Virgin and Prophets have survived. In reconstruction the cycle presents two rows, one above the other, each with four panels depicting the Life of the Virgin, which together formed the second view of the altarpiece. When closed, it showed four scenes of the Passion (now almost completely destroyed), on the reverse sides of the outer wings. The shrine that belonged to the third view is lost, but there is evidence that it contained carved relief figures of St Ottilie and a second female saint. The eight surviving half-length pictures of Prophets (Stuttgart, Staatsgalerie) may have been next to the scenes from the Life of the Virgin, as the figures are positioned outside the picture axis of the painted scenes, or may have formed the front and reverse of upper side extensions that covered the higher central shrine.



"
3232,MASTER of the Piccolomini Madonna,(active 1450-1500 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/piccolom/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor or group of sculptors. A number of reliefs of the Virgin and Child have been collected together under this name. All show the Virgin turned three-quarter face, standing behind a parapet upon which the Infant Christ reclines, raising his hand in benediction. Variations occur in the decoration of the parapet and the presence or absence of candelabra and putti's heads in the sky. In some examples the Virgin holds a cartouche. By the 1990s nine marble examples were known: Siena, Galleria Chigi-Saracini; Paris, Musée du Louvre (2 pieces); Pesaro, Museo Civico; Florence, Museo Bardini; London, Victoria and Albert Museum; Pianiga (Padua), parish church; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art; and one in private collection.



"
3233,MASTER of the Pietà,(active 1350-1375 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/pieta/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Siena. Millard Meiss in his 1946 publication assembled a group of seven paintings, ascribing them to the same anonymous hand and giving an eighth to his workshop. The group included two panels portraying the Pietà: one in the Musée du Petit Palais, Avignon and the other in the Institute of Arts, Detroit; then the earliest known Sienese treatments of the subject, their author was thus christened the ""Master of the Pietà."" Despite this moniker, the Crucifixion was the subject most frequently depicted by the artist; Meiss listed five treatments of the theme, to which a sixth was added in 2001.



"
3234,MASTER of the Playing Cards,(active 1435-1450 in the Upper Rhine),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/playing/biograph.html,"
German engraver. The most accomplished and influential member of the first generation of engravers, he is named after a series of engravings with number cards and figure cards arranged in suits of flowers, birds, deer, wild men and beasts of prey, preserved largely in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden. From the numerous copies of the suit symbols in datable manuscripts, his cards can be dated shortly before 1440.



"
3235,MASTER of the Polling Panels,(active 1435-1450 in Upper Bavaria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/polling/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was one of the most distinctive artists in early Bavarian painting and worked in the area around Munich and Kremsmünster. His oeuvre, which can be assembled with certainty on stylistic grounds, includes the panels of two winged altarpieces from the Augustinian monastery at Polling in Upper Bavaria, after which he is named. Four of these come from an altarpiece of scenes from the Life of the Virgin and are dated 1444. The altarpiece was donated by Duke Albert II of Bavaria (reg. 1438-60) and his wife, Anna (1420-74). The surviving panels are an Annunciation and Adoration of the Magi (Munich, Alte Pinakothek) and a Nativity and Presentation in the Temple (Munich, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum). Two further panels come from an altarpiece of the Holy Cross; they are a Crucifixion and three scenes of the Discovery of the True Cross (Munich, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum). Four further panels from an altarpiece of the Life of the Virgin, dated 1439, are in the Stiftsgalerie, Kremsmünster. Two well-preserved panels with St Peter and St Paul are also extant (private collection).



"
3236,MASTER of Pratovecchio,(active 1435-1455 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/pratovec/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Longhi gave the name to an anonymous Florentine painter active in the mid-15th century who was influenced by Domenico Veneziano and, to a lesser extent, by Andrea del Castagno. His most important surviving work is a dismembered triptych consisting of an Assumption of the Virgin (Pratovecchio, San Giovanni Evangelista, on dep. Arezzo, Soprintendenza alle Gallerie), side panels of Sts Michael and John the Baptist and a Bishop and Female Martyr as well as side pilasters, tondi and pinnacles (all London, National Gallery). Longhi suggested that the Death of the Virgin (Boston, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) originally formed the predella, but this is debatable."
3237,MASTER of the Prodigal Son,(active 1530-1560 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/prodigal/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He is known only by the moniker 'Master of the Prodigal Son', who worked in Antwerp between 1530-1560 and seems to have had quite an extensive workshop. He was named after his most famous work, the Parable of the Prodigal Son, which now hangs in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Although it is not known who the artist was, he is counted among the great masters of Flemish sixteenth-century mannerism, being featured in museums worldwide. "
3238,MASTER of San Francesco Bardi,(active 1240-1270 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/san_fran/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A group of works are attributed to the author of the large panel on the altar of the Capella Bardi, Santa Croce, Florence, representing St Francis and 20 Scenes from his Legend. These paintings (previously thought to belong to the Lucca school) are identified as Florentine in origin and showing signs of contact with the Bigallo Master. It was noted that two distinct painters worked on the St Francis panel, a fact that was more obvious after restoration. The principal Master of the Bardi St Francis was identified as a precursor of Coppo di Marcovaldo, who, during the first half of the 13th century, moved away from the figurative tradition of painting in Lucca and developed a style characterized by the description of form through strongly marked patterns of light and dark. Coppo could have been one of the assistants who painted the scenes beneath the figure of the saint in the Santa Croce panel. The impressive painting of a Virgin and Child Enthroned, with Scenes from the Virgin's Life (Moscow, Pushkin Museum) also has obvious stylistic and compositional affinities with the Santa Croce panel.



"
3239,MASTER of San Lucchese,(active 1340-1370),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/san_lucc/biograph.html,"
This Italian artist, whose precise identity has not yet been discovered, was named by art historians after an altarpiece once in the church of San Lucchese, Poggibonsi, south of Florence. Other works made in a similar style have been attributed to the same painter. These pictures suggest that he was influenced by the Florentine artist Maso di Banco, and that he was active from about 1340 to 1370.



"
3240,MASTER of San Miniato,(active 1460-1480 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/san_mini/biograph.html,"

Italian painter. The Master of San Miniato is a Florentine painter who was categorized by Bernard Berenson in 1913 and named after an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints in the church of San Domenico in San Miniato al Tedesco in the province of Pisa. Based on this work, Berenson compiled a catalogue of eight works. The master's art is rooted in Florentine painting of the 1460s and particularly relies on the work of Filippo Lippi. Additional influences came from Cosimo Rosselli and the first students of Andrea del Verrocchio, first and foremost the young Sandro Botticelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio."
3241,MASTER of St. Gilles,(active around 1500 in France),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/stgilles/biograph.html,"Flemish (or Flemish-trained) painter named after two panels representing scenes from the life of St Gilles (National Gallery, London). Two other panels, now in Washington (National Gallery of Art), have been connected with them, but they seem to come from another altarpiece by the same hand. Other paintings in the same style in Berlin, Boston, Brussels, Chantilly (Musée Condé) and Paris (Louvre) have been grouped round them. Their attention to detail and their meticulous finish have caused some to consider that the artist was trained in the Netherlands, but the inclusion of views of Paris in some of his works indicates that he worked there, whatever his origin. His work is of high quality and he must have been one of the best painters of the day in northern France.



"
3242,MASTER of Saint Nicholas,(active 1465-1500 in Burgos),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/stnicola/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, representative of Hispano-Flemish painting. His name derives from the altarpiece in the church of St Nicholas of Bari in Burgos, a key work in his artistic production.



"
3243,MASTER of the Straus Madonna,(active 1385–1415 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/straus/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His oeuvre has been reconstructed (Longhi; Offner) around a Virgin and Child (formerly in Percy S. Straus collection, New York). Of over 30 surviving panels painted in Florence and its environs, the Master's only dated work is the small, incisive Man of Sorrows (1405; Warsaw, National Museum)."
3244,MASTER of the Tegernsee Passion,(active 1430-1450 in Germany),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/tegernse/biograph.html,"
German painter. He is named after the main altarpiece (1444-45) at the former Benedictine monastery of St Quirinus at Tegernsee. Since the altarpiece was documented as the tabula magna, he is also called the Master of the Tegernsee Tabula Magna. He was thought to be the Munich painter Gabriel Mälesskircher until it was demonstrated that he belonged to a generation preceding that of Mälesskircher, whose 13 altarpieces for the Tegernsee Monastery were painted from 1474. Recently discovered archival evidence points to the Munich painter Gabriel Angler the Elder (c. 1405-1462) as the artist in question."
3245,MASTER THEODERIC,(active 1350-70 in Prague),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/theoderi/biograph.html,"
Bohemian painter. He was first head of the painter's guild in Prague, founded in 1348, and was painter to the emperor Charles IV between 1359 and 1367. For Charles he decorated the Holy Cross Chapel of Karlstein Castle near Prague with more than a hundred panels of saints, prophets, and angels, most of them still in situ. He shows even more clearly than the Master of Vyssi Brod the evolution of a distinct Bohemian School from Italian and French antecedents.



"
3246,MASTER THOMAS de Coloswar,(first half of 15th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/thomas/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. His name was retained in the inscription of a predella which got from Garamszentbenedek to the Gallery of Esztergom. Unfortunately, it was destroyed later. Commissioned by Miklós Péterfia, the canon of Gyõr in 1427, the picture in the middle of the triptych showed the sufferings of Christ with the lives of the saints on the both sides of the triptych in a style integrating International Gothic realism with the style of contemporary German masters. The triptych, which is highly expressive and realistic, is one of the best of its kind. His major works are Christ on the Mount Olives, Christ Carrying the Cross, Resurrection, Ascension, St. Benedict, St. Egidius and Bari Saint Nicholas (all in the Christian Museum, Esztergom).



"
3247,MASTER of the Trebon Altarpiece,(active in 1380-1400 in Bohemia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/trebon/biograph.html,"Master of the Trebon Altarpiece or of Wittingau, Bohemian painter, active in the late 14th century, named after his main work, three panels (c. 1380-90) from an altarpiece originally in the monastery at Trebon (Wittingau) in the Czech Republic and now in the National Gallery, Prague. They represent the next stage in Bohemian painting after Master Theoderic, being related to the soft style. With him the art at the short lived imperial court of Prague reached its climax. His style points west rather than south and shows particular affinities with Burgundian art and Melchior Broederlam.


"
3248,MASTER of San Trovaso,(active c. 1470 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/trovaso/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. The artist is named after three superlative reliefs of unknown origin now set into an altar frontal in San Trovaso, Venice. Two of the reliefs depict Angels Playing Musical Instruments and the third shows Angels Carrying the Instruments of the Passion (there are anonymous copies of the reliefs in Skultpurensammlung, Berlin). Attempts to attribute the works of the Master of San Trovaso to Agostino di Duccio have not found favour. Pope-Hennessy thought it possible that a relief depicting the Head of St John the Baptist in the sacristy of Santa Maria del Giglio, Venice, was by the same Master. Paoletti (1893) stressed the similarities with works by Antonio Rizzo Comparison of the San Trovaso panels with Rizzo's reliefs (executed after 1486) for the Scala dei Giganti in the courtyard of the Doge's Palace, Venice, adds weight to the hypothesis that the Master can be identified with Rizzo, but this suggestion - more convincing than any other - has gained little support.



"
3249,MASTER of Saint Veronica,(active 1400-1420 in Cologne),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/veronica/biograph.html,"
The Master of Saint Veronica is named after an image of the saint in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. He is regarded as the most important painter in Cologne before Stefan Lochner who was influenced by him. His work is distinguished by soft contours and subtle colour combinations.



"
3250,MASTER of the Vienna Adoration,(active around 1410),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/vienna/biograph.html,"
The painter was given his name after a work representing the Adoration of Jesus, which is preserved in Vienna. His paintings are examples of mature International Gothic style (Soft Style or Beautiful Style)."
3251,MASTER of the Virgo inter Virgines,(active 1470-1500 in Delft),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/virgo/biograph.html,"Netherlandish painter, named after a picture representing the Virgin Mary surrounded by the virgin saints Barbara, Catherine, Cecilia, and Ursula (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). He worked in Delft, and his style is reflected in the woodcut illustrations (which he presumably designed) to several books published there between 1482 and 1498. About twenty paintings have been attributed to him, revealing a very distinctive and distinguished artist, who obtained his highly emotional effects through intense colours, desolate landscapes, and gaunt figures. His work is sometimes awkward but always sincere and involving. Two of his finest paintings are The Crucifixion (Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle) and The Entombment (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool).



"
3252,MASTER of the Votive Picture of Sankt Lambrecht,(active around 1430 in Austria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/master/votive/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He is named after an International Gothic style panel formerly in the abbey of St Lambrecht, Styria (c. 1425-30; Graz, Alte Galerie), in which Abbot Heinrich Moyker (1419-55), the donor, kneels before the Virgin of Mercy, with St Hemma of Gurk (or St Hedwig), in a landscape setting showing the Hungarians' victory over the Turks. Other works have been ascribed to this artist, some in contention with attributions to the Master of the Linz Crucifixion (Linz, Oberösterreich. Landesmuseum), to Hans von Judenburg and to Hans von Tübingen (active Wiener Neustadt, c. 1433-62). Tübingen's activity seems too late to be identified with the Master of St Lambrecht's group of paintings, normally dated c. 1410-40. Among the panels that have been attributed to the Master and his workshop are the Trinity with Christ Crucified ('Throne of Mercy') or Gnadenstuhl Trinity, c. 1410-20; London, National Gallery) and the Trinity Pietà (c. 1430; Vienna, Museum mittelalterlicher österreichischer Kunst). A stained-glass window (c. 1430-40; St Lambrecht, St Peter), with Old Testament parallels to the life of Christ, has also been attributed to him."
3253,"MATEJKO, Jan","(b. 1838, Kraków, d. 1893, Kraków)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matejko/biograph.html,"
Polish painter, known for paintings of notable historical Polish political and military events. He studied from 1852 to 1858 at the School of Fine Arts in Cracow and, during this time, started exhibiting historical paintings with the Society of Friends of the Fine Arts there. After studying in Munich (1859) under the history painter Hermann Anschütz (1802-1880) and then briefly and less successfully in Vienna, Matejko returned to Cracow, where he was based for the rest of his life."
3254,"MATES, Joan","(b. ca. 1370, Vilafranca del Penedes, d. 1431, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mates/biograph.html,"
Catalan painter. He completed a retable of SS Thomas and Anthony, which had been left unfinished at Pere Serra's death, for Barcelona Cathedral in 1409. Mates undertook a number of distinguished commissions for altarpieces in Barcelona and as far afield as Huesca in Aragon. His documented surviving works are the retable of SS Martin and Ambrose in Barcelona Cathedral (1411), the retable of St Sebastian (1417; Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona) for the chapel of Pia Almoina, Barcelona, and the high altar retable of S Maria, Vila-rodena (1422). Other works attributed to him include the retables of SS Lucy and Michael (Private collection), St Jaume de Vallespinosa (Tarragona Cathedral) and the Entombment (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona)."
3255,"MATHAM, Jacob","(b. 1571, Haarlem, d. 1631, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matham/jacob/biograph.html,"
Dutch engraver, draughtsman and painter. He was the stepson and pupil of painter and draftsman Hendrik Goltzius, and brother-in-law to engraver Simon de Poelenborch, having married his sister, Marijtgen. When the pre-eminent engraver Hendrick Goltzius married Matham's mother in 1579, he took Jacob on as an apprentice. Matham worked more closely with Goltzius than others of his circle, engraving many of the master's drawings and paintings and closely imitating his teacher's manner. Despite Matham's prolific output, his artistic personality does not emerge clearly, and the oeuvres of both engravers contain unsigned works."
3256,"MATHAM, Theodor","(b. ca. 1605, Haarlem, d. 1676, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matham/theodor/biograph.html,"
Dutch engraver, part of a family of printmakers. He was the younger son of the better known engraver Jacob Matham, and the brother of the engravers Jan and Adriaen Matham."
3257,"MATHEY, Jean Baptiste","(b. ca, 1630, Dijon, d. ca. 1696, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mathey/biograph.html,"
Jean Baptiste Mathey (also Matheus, Mathieu, Matthei), French architect and painter, active in Bohemia. He was a representative of classicised style of high Baroque at its beginning. In Bohemia he worked solely as a designer because he was not accepted to the builders guild. He worked for Prague archbishop, church orders (Premonstratensians, Knights of the Cross or Theatines), nobility (Sternbergs, Šliks, Wallensteins) and for the king (at the Prague castle). Models for his academic, prosaic designs were often older buildings of Romanesque style."
3258,MATTEO DA CAMPIONE,"(b. ca. 1335, Campione d'Italia, d. 1396, Monza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matte/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He belonged to group of Lombard artists originated from the lake area known as the Campione Masters (Ugo da Campione, Bonino da Campione, Giovanni da Campione, Zenone da Campione, Matteo da Campione) who were active in Northern Italy from the late twelfth century to the end of the fourteenth century."
3259,"MATTEINI, Teodoro","(b. 1754, Pistoia, d. 1831, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matteini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Having studied in Rome with Domenico Corvi and Pompeo Batoni, Matteini moved first to Florence (Angelica and Medoro, 1794) and then to Milan, where he encountered Bossi and Appiani. In 1807, he settled in Venice and taught at the Accademia. A prolific portraitist, he brought new life to the genre by studying the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough.


"
3260,"MATTEIS, Paolo de","(b. 1662, Salerno, d. 1728, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matteis/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and silversmith. He was important to the history of painting in Naples in the transitional period between the 17th and 18th centuries. His elegant art encouraged the movement away from Baroque drama towards a more tender, rocaille style in harmony with the earliest manifestations in Naples of the Arcadian school of poetry and of the Enlightenment. He painted frescoes, altarpieces and allegorical and mythological pictures."
3261,MATTEO di Giovanni,"(b. ca. 1430, Borgo San Sepolcro, d. 1495, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matteo/biograph.html,"
Italian (Sienese) painter, who originally came from Borgo San Sepolcro and he painted the wings and predella (Pinacoteca Sansepolcro) of the altarpiece of which Piero della Francesca's Baptism of Christ (National Gallery, London) was the centre panel."
3262,MATTEO DI SER CAMBIO,(active 1377-1427 in Perugia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matteo_c/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith and miniaturist. He was registered with the Guild of Goldsmiths in Perugia in about 1350. From about 1370, date of his first signed work, his workshop was the most active and the most sought-after in Perugia during that period. Although all his work as a goldsmith has been lost, many of his works of miniature, however, remain, especially his elaborate illuminations of the Perugia Statutes and Lists of the Guilds. The most well known amongst the works that made him famous are his illuminations in the Statute and List of the Guilds of 1377 for two of the most important town guilds, the Moneychangers and the Merchants."
3263,MATTEO DI PACINO,(active 1359-1374 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matteo_p/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Florence, formerly known as the Master of the Rinuccini Chapel. He initially followed neo-Daddesque methods then moved to a convinced propagation of formulas captivating on both the compositional and chromatic planes.



"
3264,MATTHEW PARIS,(c. 1200-1259),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matthew/biograph.html,"
Matthew Paris was an English chronicler and manuscript illuminator. In 1217 he became a Benedictine monk at St Albans and in 1236 succeeded Roger of Wendover as the abbey's chronicler. Although his surname, which he usually wrote Parisiensis, could suggest French origins, he was most probably an Englishman characteristically trained in both Latin and Anglo-Norman. References in his works to the University of Paris, however, raise the possibility that he had studied at one of the schools in Paris. Paris maintained a wide range of contacts with the outside world through the steady flow of documents to St Albans and through the abbey's many visitors, including Henry III and his brother, Richard of Cornwall. He attended many important royal celebrations at Westminster, Canterbury, Winchester and York, and in 1248 he was sent to Norway to reform the monastery of St Benet Holm.



"
3265,"MATTHIEU, Georg David","(b. 1737, Berlin, d. 1778, Ludwigslust)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/matthieu/biograph.html,"
German Rococo portrait painter and engraver, working at the court of the Duke of Mecklenburg. He came from a family of artists, his father David was a court painter at the Prussian court."
3266,"MAUFRA, Maxime","(b. 1861, Nantes, d. 1918, Poncé-sur-le-Loir)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maufra/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He began painting under the guidance of local painters in Nantes such as the brothers Charles Leduc (b. 1831) and Alfred Leduc (c. 1850-1913) and the landscape painter Charles Le Roux (1841-1895). Having originally intended to go into business, he turned to painting after a visit in 1883 to Britain, where he first saw the work of Turner. Back in Nantes he was encouraged to take up art by Charles Le Roux, who initiated him into the techniques of the Impressionists."
3267,"MAULBERTSCH, Franz Anton","(b. 1724, Langenargen, d. 1796, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maulbert/biograph.html,"
Maulbertsch (or Maulpertsch) was the outstanding Austrian decorative painter of the 18th century. He was active and extremely productive over a wide area of central Europe and most of his works (altarpieces as well as frescoes) are still in the churches and secular buildings in Austria, the Czech republic, Hungary, and Slovakia for which they were painted. Maulbertsch's vivacious, colourful, and emotional style was almost completely resistant to Neoclassical influences, representing the last glorious flowering of the Baroque and Rococo tradition. His painterly dash is even more apparent in his oil sketches, which are well represented in the Barockmuseum, Vienna, and he was also an outstanding etcher."
3268,"MAUPERCHÉ, Henri","(b. 1602, Paris, d. 1686, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mauperch/biograph.html,"
French painter who along with Pierre Patel the Elder was one of the few imitators of Claude Lorraine to work in France. In Rome from 1634 onwards, he came under the influence of the Bamboccianti. In 1648 he was one ot the fourteen founder-members of the French Academy in Paris.



"
3269,"MAUREAU, Alphonse",(active in 1870s),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maureau/biograph.html,"
French Impressionist painter. Exact details of his life are unknown. He was a friend of Degas, Manet and Desboutin, and was a member of the artistic clientele in the Café de la Nouvelles-Athènes. In 1877 he was invited by Degas to show four works at the 3rd Impressionist exhibition. In 1878 Manet did a pastel portrait of him wearing a round hat.



"
3270,"MAURER, Hubert","(b. 1738, Röttchen, d. 1818, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/maurer/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. From 1772 until about 1776, he was one of a group of artists provided with a pension. He was also one of the first Academy artists awarded a scholarship to Rome. He specialized in portraits and religious subjects."
3271,"MAUVE, Anton","(b. 1838, Zaandam, d. 1888, Arnhem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mauve/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He came from a large family of clergymen in the province of North Holland. At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to the animal painter Pieter Frederik van Os (1808-1892): animals (especially sheep, but also cows and horses) became Mauve's preferred theme. He then trained for a few months with Wouterus Verschuur (1812-1874), who gave him his love of horses, in the style, at least, of Paulus Potter and Philips Wouwerman. Initially Mauve painted primarily horses. In his further development he worked with Paul Gabriël, painting from nature, and they regularly stayed and worked together at Oosterbeek, the 'Dutch Barbizon'. He was a friend of Jozef Israëls and Willem Maris."
3272,"MAY, Edward Harrison","(b. 1824, Croydon, d. 1887, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/may/biograph.html,"
American painter, active in Paris. Born in Croydon, England, he was the son of Edward Harrison May Sr., a Dutch Reformed clergyman and was brought to America in 1834 when his father accepted a post in New York. After early training in civil engineering, May turned to art. He studied at the National Academy and with Daniel Huntington in New York; he focused on portraiture. After relocating to Paris in 1851 and entering the studio of Thomas Couture, he began producing historical and genre subjects. As with many American artists of the period, May's time in Paris inspired decisive changes in his style and subjects. On the whole, it stimulated the creation of technically advanced and thematically sophisticated works."
3273,"MAYER, Marie-Constance","(b. 1775, Paris, d. 1821, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mayer/biograph.html,"
French woman painter. Constance Mayer's name is closely associated with that of Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, with whom she collaborated on many works often catalogued under his name. She was one of an increasing number of women artists who worked mainly as painters of miniatures, portraits and genre scenes. In the middle years of her career, under the impact of Prud'hon's influence, she turned to allegorical subjects."
3274,"MAYR, Johann Ulrich","(b. 1630, Augsburg, d. 1704, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mayr/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was the son of Christoph Georg Mayr, a rich merchant in Augsburg, and Susanne Fischer (1600-74), a painter and engraver. In the 1640s he studied with Rembrandt in Amsterdam and with Jacob Jordaens in Antwerp and also travelled to England and Italy. He specialized in portraiture, sometimes depicting his models in historical costumes. His earliest works date from the 1650s, for example Self-portrait (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg). Rembrandt's guidance is evident in the profile Portrait of a Poet (1653; Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Vaduz). The influence of Jordaens can be seen in his conception of the half-length David with the Head of Goliath (Schaezler Palais, Augsburg), in which Mayr combined portraiture with an Old Testament theme."
3275,"MAZENTA, Giovanni Ambrogio","(b. 1565, Milano, d. 1635, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazenta/biograph.html,"Giovanni Mazenta (or Magenta), Italian architect, Barnabite monk. He worked with his architect brothers Guido, Alessandro and Francesco. Giovanni was the strongest talent at Bologna during the first quarter of the seventeenth century. A man of great intellectual power, engineer, mathematician, and theoretician, he even became in 1612 General of his Order."

French sculptor of whom little is known before his emergence around 1679 working at Versailles, where he was commissioned - together with Anselme Flamen and Claude Poirier - to produce statues for the Companions of Diana."
3277,"MAZO, Juan Bautista Martinez del","(b. 1610/15, Cuenza, d. 1667, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazo/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was a pupil of Velázquez, married his daughter in 1633, and succeeded him as court painter in 1661. Among his very few signed works is a portrait of Queen Mariana (National Gallery, London, 1666), and many of the works attributed to him were formerly given to Velázquez, whose mature style he imitated with great assurance.



"
3278,"MAZONE, Giovanni",(active 1453-1512 in Liguria),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and wood-carver. Though originally from Alessandria, he was released from the bonds of patria potestà in Genoa in 1453 by his father, Giacomo Mazone (active 1434-1453), who was also a painter. Giovanni's first recorded commission dates from 1463, when he was engaged to make a relief-carving on an altar (untraced) for the chapel of San Giovanni Battista in Genoa Cathedral. Wood-carving, mentioned again in 1476 in a contract for the renovation of the main altar of Genoa Cathedral, constantly occupied his workshop, which specialized in polyptych frames."
3279,"MAZZA, Giuseppe Maria","(b. 1653, Bologna, d. 1741, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazza/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, the son of the sculptor Camillo Mazza (1602-72) with whom he trained for a time. Mazza was the most celebrated Bolognese sculptor after the death of Algardi. Like the young Algardi, he studied with painters (Domenico Canuti, Carlo Cignani, and Lorenzo Pasinelli) rather than sculptors and evolved a distinctive, painterly style of his reliefs. This was unusual, but meant that Mazza's work fitted well into large, decorative projects, such as the transformation of the old church of Corpus Domini in Bologna where he collaborated with the architect Giacomo Monti (1620-1692) and the painter Marcantonio Franceschini (1648-1729) from 1686 to 1695. Mazza evidently went on well with Franceschini, who was the dominant artistic influence in the area. At the church of Corpus Domini, the renovation included elaborate frescoing complemented by Mazza's reliefs and statues in plaster. Franceschini provided basic designs for Mazza's statues of St Francis and St Clare to either side of the high altar."
3280,"MAZZA, Tommaso del",(active 1375-1391 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazza_t/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, who has been identified as the anonymous master known as the Master of Saint Verdiana. Until recently, much of del Mazza's work was attributed to the Master of Saint Verdiana, whose name derives from the inclusion of this figure in the altarpiece."
3281,"MAZZANTI, Ludovico","(b. 1686, Roma, d. 1775, Orvieto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzanti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He served his apprenticeship under Giovanni Battista Gaulli from 1700 onwards and was influenced by the classicism of Maratti as well as by the Baroque tendencies of Lanfranco in the refined form found in the work of Giovanni Battista Beinaschi (1638-1688). His painting was produced in the cultural climate of the Society of Arcadia and the Accademia di San Luca, which included Giovanni Odazzi (1663-1731) and other Roman decorative artists. He took part in the Concorsi Clementini in 1703-05 and 1708, becoming a member of the Accademia di San Luca in 1744 and of the Accademia Clementina in 1748."
3282,"MAZZETTI TENCALLA, Carpoforo","(b. 1685, Bissone, d. 1743, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzetti/biograph.html,"
Italian stuccoist. He was the grandchild of the fresco painter Carpoforo Tencalla (1623-1685) whose name he took. He settled in Venice and became the pupil and later the collaborator of the stuccoist Abbondio Stazio. The two artists worked together. As early as 1718 they were in Palazzo Sagredo, and later on they worked more than once in the Gesuiti (1726-27 and 1732-34). They were commissioned to work on the Scuola Grande dei Carmini to carry out white and gilded stuccowork on the ceiling of the Sala Capitolare there.



"
3283,"MAZZIERE, Agnolo di Domenico","(b. ca. 1466, Firenze, d. 1513, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazziere/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Agnolo and Donnino del Mazziere ran a significant artistic enterprise in Florence during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. The brothers were trained in the studio of the traditionalist painter Cosimo Rosselli, then they have established their own shop by the late 1480s. Vasari mentioned in the life of Cosimo Rosselli that Agnolo, the more talented of the brothers, was a skilled draftsman and remained a close friend of Cosimo Rosselli's until the master's death in 1507. That he was recognized as a painter of some technical proficiency is further attested by the fact that Michelangelo included him among the artists called to Rome in 1507-1508 to consult on preparations for the Sistine Chapel ceiling."
3284,"MAZZOLA BEDOLI, Girolamo","(b. 1500, Viadana, d. ca. 1569, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzola/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, originally Girolamo Bedola. His career was intimately linked with that of Parmigianino, whose principal disciple he was. According to Vasari, who met him in 1566, Bedoli and Parmigianino fled Parma together during the war of 1521-22, which points to a very early connection. Bedoli probably received training in the rudiments of his art in the workshop of Parmigianino's uncle, Pier' Ilario Mazzola, whose daughter he married in 1529. Bedoli later added Mazzola to his name. Many of Bedoli's finest works, such as the Virgin and Child with St Bruno (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), were once attributed to Parmigianino, and there is still controversy concerning their respective oeuvres.



"
3285,"MAZZOLA, Giuseppe","(b. 1748, Valduggia, d. 1838, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzola1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied briefly with Martin Knoller, then in the Academy of Parma, and later under Anton Raphael Mengs. He was the successor of Knoller as teacher of painting at the Brera Academy as well as conservator of the Pinacoteca. He lost his right hand at 40 years of age, and began painting with left hand. Among his works are an Assumption of the Virgin for the parish church of Grignasco; a St Phillip for the church of Biella; and a Resurrection for the Rotonda of Somasco.



"
3286,"MAZZOLANI, Giuseppe","(b. 1842, Ferrara, d. 1916, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzolan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and lithographer. Encouraged by his father, in 1855 he attended courses in painting at the institute of art of Ferrara, distinguishing himself as a copyist of ancient works. In March, 1865 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Milan, where he attended the lithography course taught by Michele Fanoli (1807-1876). During these years of apprenticeship Mazzolani learned the use of the pantograph, practicing in the copy of the masters of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, such as Lorenzo Costa and Raphael."
3287,"MAZZOLINO, Ludovico","(b. ca. 1480, Ferrara, d. after 1528)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzolin/biograph.html,"
Ludovico Mazzolino (also Mazzuoli or Manzulin da Ferrera), Italian painter of the Ferrarese school. His close contacts with Ercole Roberti's workshop are documented as are those with Boccaccio Boccaccino. His work also reflects the direct influence of Costa and the contacts with transalpine art. Later Raphaelesque tendencies, especially in his pictorial design, can be attributed to a period in Rome.



"
3288,"MAZZONI, Guido","(active after 1473, d. 1518, Modena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzoni/guido/biograph.html,"Guido Mazzoni (Modanino, Paganino), Italian sculptor, painter, mask-maker and festival director. Throughout his career he was associated with the stage, and known as a painter as well as a sculptor. He was brought up by a paternal uncle, Paganino Mazzoni, a Modenese notary and official of the Este bureaucracy. This connection with the ducal court of Ferrara throws some light on the artist's early training, which is otherwise obscure. A document of 1472 refers to him as a painter, and his first sculpture strongly echoes the figural style in Francesco del Cossa's frescoes (1466–the mid-1470s) at the Palazzo Schifanoia outside Ferrara. Mazzoni may have worked at the Palazzo Schifanoia in association with the stucco master Domenico di Paris, where he may have learnt to model papier-mâché props for the court masques that contemporary sources say he directed and designed. A related activity of these years was making the realistic and caricatural festival masks (volti modenesi) for which Modena was famous."
3289,"MAZZONI, Sebastiano","(b. ca. 1611, Firenze, d. 1678, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzoni/sebastia/biograph.html,"

3290,"MAZZUOLI, Giuseppe","(b. 1643, Volterra, d. 1725, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mazzuoli/biograph.html,"
Italian Late Baroque sculptor. Soon after his birth he moved with his family to Siena, where his father, Dionysio Mazzuoli, an architect and engineer, undertook to rebuild Prince Mattia's palazzo. Giuseppe's earliest training was provided by his younger brother Giovanni Antonio (1644-1706), who remained behind in Siena when he himself went to Rome. There Giuseppe entered the workshop of Ercole Ferrata but worked directly under Melchiorre Cafà. So, probably sometime in the mid-1660s (Cafà died in an accident in 1667), this Sienese sculptor became part of a rich artistic culture in Rome. His first project involved the funerary monument to Alexander VII in St Peter's, supervised by Bernini, to which he contributed the marble figure of Charity (bozzetto prepared by Bernini c. 1673). "
3291,"MCCULLOCH, Horatio","(b. 1805, Glasgow, d. 1867, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mcculloc/biograph.html,"
Scottish landscape painter. He was trained in the studio of the Glasgow landscape painter John Knox (1778-1845) for about one year alongside David Macnee (1806-1882) and at first earned his living as a decorative painter."
3292,"MCNICOLL, Helen Galloway","(b. 1879, Toronto, d. 1915, Swanage)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mcnicoll/biograph.html,"
Canadian painter. The eldest of eight children and deaf from a childhood bout of scarlet fever, Helen McNicoll was an artist known for her plein air, Impressionist style of painting. She attended the Art Association of Montreal, studying under William Brymner (1855-1925) from 1899. In 1902 she moved to England to study in London at the Slade School and later in St Ives, Cornwall with Algernon Talmage (1871-1939)."
3293,"MECKEL, Adolf von","(b. 1856, Berlin, d. 1893, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meckel/biograph.html,"
Adolf Meckel von Hemsbach, German landscape and genre painter. He was a descendant of Johann Friedrich Meckel the Elder (1724-1774), German anatomist and founder of the Meckel Collection. His father was Johann Heinrich Meckel von Hemsbach (1821-1856), professor of pathological anatomy. After the early death of his father, he spent his childhood with the maternal grandparents in Saint Petersburg."

German engraver, the son of an engraver of the same name, active c. 1450-65. He was trained by his father and probably by Master E.S., whose work he copied. His oeuvre is bigger than that of any other 15th-century engraver; he is known to have made more than 600 plates, and in some instances over a hundred prints have been preserved from each plate. Like many early engravers, he also worked as a goldsmith. Although he was a minor figure as a creative artist (much of his work consisted of copies), he is important in showing the growing popularity of engraving. He was the first artist to engrave his own features (in a double portrait together with his wife) and looks a very shrewd individual.



"
3295,"MEDARD, Jules-Ferdinand","(b. ca. 1855, Anzin, d. 1925, Anzin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/medard/biograph.html,"
French painter, specialised in floral still-life. His still-lifes were often arranged formally in a vase, but also sometimes scattered more casually across a tabletop. A pupil of Jean Marie Reigner (1815-1886) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Lyon in 1871, he exhibited his works there at the Salon des Printemps from 1875, and then from 1878 at the Paris Salon. He won acclaim for his works in his lifetime and had a number of pupils.



"
3296,"MEDNYÁNSZKY, László","(b. 1852, Beckó, d. 1919, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mednyans/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter and illustrator. His talent presented itself very early. He was a student at the Technische Hochschule in Zurich from 1870, at the Munich Academy from 1872 and at the École des Beaux Arts, Paris, in 1873-75, where Isidore Pils was his master. The pictures of this period reflect the infleunce of the Barbizon school, especially that of Corot. He visited Szolnok in the autumn of 1877 where his pictures became airier and lighter as a result of Pettenkofen's influence. He visited Italy in 1878. He had a studio in Vienna in the early 1880s. After the death of his mother, he went to Nagyõr in 1883, where he lived secluded."
3297,"MEDUNA, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1800, Venezia, d. 1880, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meduna/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He performed many works of reconstruction and restoration. With his brother Tommaso, he was the rebuilder of the La Fenice theater, destroyed by fire in 1836. He worked also on San Marco and the Ca' d'Oro. Also with his brother, he constructed the theatre of Ravenna with classic proportions.



"
3298,"MEHUS, Livio","(b. ca. 1630, Oudenaarde, d. 1691, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mehus/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active mainly in Florence. After an obscure training in Milan with a battle-painter, he traveled at the age of 15 years to Rome, where he was a pupil of the painter Pietro da Cortona, and often worked with Ciro Ferri. In Florence, he had extensive patronage from the Medici family. From Florence, he left to join theater players for the Duke of Savoy in Turin, but after three years he returned to painting in Florence, where he joined Stefano della Bella. He assisted in the decoration of the cupola of the church of La Pace at Florence."
3299,"MEI, Bernardino","(b. 1612, Siena, d. 1676, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mei/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. His early art drew on a variety of sources, which included the naturalism of Rutilio Manetti and Francesco Rustici, the descriptive realism of the engraver Giuliano Periccioli (d 1646) and the Baroque of Raffaelle Vanni. Mei's interests even embraced 16th-century Sienese art. This stylistic variety is evident in his first known works, such as a bier (Casole d'Elsa, Collegiata), three signed miniatures in the Libro dei leoni (1634; Siena, Palazzo Piccolomini, Archivio Stato) and frescoes of scenes from the Life of St Bernard (1639; Siena, oratory of S Bernardino). His experimental approach is also displayed in such works as the Annunciation (Siena, Seminario Montarioso), which may be dated between the mid-1630s and the early 1640s. Mei's early maturity is marked by a conscious return to the naturalism of Manetti, enriched with a Baroque pathos and soft, fluid brushwork, as in the St Peter in Prison Awoken by the Angel and St Peter Freed by the Angel (both Siena; Conservatori Femminili Riuniti)."
3300,"MEIFRÉN Y ROIG, Eliseo","(b. 1859, Barcelona, d. 1940, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meifren/biograph.html,"

3301,"MEISSONIER, Jean-Louis-Ernest","(b. 1815, Lyon, d. 1891, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meissoni/biograph.html,"
French painter, etcher, lithographer, and sculptor. He was immense1y successful with his trite and nigglingly detailed historical paintings and historical genre pieces (particularly scenes from the Napoleonic campaigns) and from the 1840s received the highest official honours, including the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour - he was the first painter to win this award. Astonishingly conceited as well as mean-spirited, he cultivated a huge white beard and liked to be photographed or painted in attitudes of fiercely profound thought, as in his self-portrait of 1889 in the Musée d'Orsay. He had a personal enmity for Courbet and may have been instrumental in inducing the government to impose a fine on him after the suppression of the Commune. Meissonier did his best work when he was at his least pretentious."
3302,"MEISSONNIER, Juste-Aurèle","(b. 1698, Torino, d. 1750, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meissonn/biograph.html,"
French designer, architect and goldsmith. He was apprenticed to his father Etienne Meissonnier, a sculptor and silversmith of some importance, before making his way to Paris, arriving in 1714. He worked there as a die-cutter and medallist, progressing through the ranks of the metalworkers' guild. He was variously described as a chaser, a designer and, in 1723, as a maker of watchcases; he worked for ten years at the royal furnishings factory of Gobelins, Paris."
3303,"MEIT, Conrad","(b. ca. 1480, Worms, d. 1550, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meit/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. In 1506-10 he worked at the court of Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, at Wittenberg, collaborating with Cranach. Soon afterwards he moved to the Netherlands, where he worked as court sculptor to the Habsburg rulers for most of his career."
3304,"MEKEREN, Jan van","(b. 1658, Tiel, d. 1733, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mekeren/biograph.html,"
Dutch cabinetmaker. He is particularly associated with spectacular floral-marquetry cabinets. His Amsterdam workshops also produced such other furniture in the Baroque style as tables and guéridons (small, often circular centre table supported by one or more columns, or sculptural human, or mythological figures) en suite with the cabinets. The marquetry designs, derived from Dutch still-life paintings, achieved brilliant trompe l'oeil effects through the use of various coloured veneers. His work ranks among the most illustrious of the period; compared with that of his contemporary André Charles Boulle, however, van Mekeren's style is freer and less disciplined. The marquetry decoration, for example, often extends down the legs and over the cornices. The value of his estate indicates that commercially his business was highly successful. Nine cabinets can be attributed to him, the most impressive of which is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.



"
3305,"MELBYE, Anton","(b. 1818, København, d. 1875, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/melbye/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He was the oldest of the three Melbye brothers (the others were Vilhelm and Fritz) and a well known marine artist. He had originally wanted to be a sailor, but abandoned this ambition because of bad eyesight. Similarly, he later gave up training as a shipbuilder, deciding instead to become a marine painter."
3306,"MELÉNDEZ, Luis","(b. 1716, Napoli, d. 1780, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/melendez/biograph.html,"Spanish still-life painter, active mainly in Madrid. He is regarded as the finest Spanish painter in his speciality in the 18th century continuing the austere traditions of the 'bodegón' established by Sanchez Cotán, as well as Velázquez and Zurbarán. He is sometimes called 'the Spanish Chardin' but he spent much of his life in poverty.

"
3307,MELIORE DI JACOPO,(active 1260-80 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meliore/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The signature Melior appears on a dossal dated 1271 depicting Christ with the Virgin and Saints (Florence, Uffizi), and it can be identified as that of Meliore dipintore, populi Sancti Jacobi tra le fosse ('Meliore the Painter, of the Parish of St Jacob between the Ditches') mentioned among the combatants in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. The suggestion that the artist was the Megliore di Jacopo documented at Pistoia from 1239 to 1253 is less certain. There is also evidence of a panel (untraced) signed and dated 1270 that existed in the 17th century in the church of S Francesco, Barberino di Val d'Elsa. On the basis of stylistic similarities, a dossal depicting the Virgin and Child with SS Peter and Paul and Four Scenes from the Saints' Lives (Panzano, Greve, S Leolino) is also attributed to Meliore and is regarded as the most important work of his early period. The influence of contemporary Pisan painting is evident in this work, but the deliberate placing of the characters in a narrative context recalls the style of the Bigallo Master.


"
3308,"MELLAN, Claude","(b. 1598, Abbeville, d. 1688, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mellan/biograph.html,"
French draughtsman, engraver and painter. He moved to Paris at a young age, his first print, produced for a theological thesis presented at the Mathurins College indicating that he was in the capital from 1619 onwards. Anatole de Courde de Montaiglon catalogued 400 engravings by him, and about 100 of his drawings are known. He executed powerful portraits which were highly appreciated."
3309,"MELLIN, Charles","(b. ca. 1600, Nancy, d. 1649, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mellin/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. He came from a Liégeois family recently settled in Nancy, then the capital of the independent duchy of Lorraine. He trained in that city at a time when the leading artist was Jacques Bellange. He must have left for Italy, perhaps with the help of Duke Henry II (reg 1608-24), around 1618-20, since he was in Rome from 1620 onwards. He built his career principally in Rome but spent two lengthy periods in Naples. In Rome he remained in contact with other artists from his native duchy, including Claude Lorrain who witnessed his will.



"
3310,"MELONE, Altobello","(b. ca. 1485, Cremona, d. ca. 1543, Cremona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/melone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. The formation of the artist, based on the culture of Ferrara at the end of the fifteenth century, had subsequently drawn some of its characteristics from the Venetian circles in which Giorgione and Dürer prevailed. This milieu had also a remarkable influence  on the Ferrarese Mazzolino, whose analogies with Melone have been stressed."
3311,MELOZZO DA FORLI,"(b. 1438, Forli, d. 1494, Forli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/melozzo/biograph.html,"Italian painter from Forli in the Romagna, active mainly in Loreto, Rome, and Urbino. He was an attractive and idiosyncratic painter who achieved a high reputation in his time, but little of his work survives intact and he has been a neglected figure until fairly recently. His style was indebted to Piero della Francesca and he was renowned for his skill in perspective and illusionism; he was, indeed, credited with being the inventor of extreme form of foreshortening known as sotto in sù, of which Mantegna was another great exponent. Melozzo's skill in this field is seen in his fresco of the Ascension (1478-80) for the dome of SS. Apostoli in Rome, fragments of which are in the Quirinal Palace and the Vatican.



"
3312,"MELZI, Francesco","(b. 1493, Milano, d. 1570, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/melzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, pupil, assistant and confidant of Leonardo da Vinci. He worked with Leonardo in Rome, Bologna and he also followed him to France. He was clearly dependent on his master and he was his companion during the last stage of his life. He was also the one who completed Leonardo's treatise on painting after his death. Melzi appears to have shared the master's knowledge, and Leonardo developed his last works together with him. He made him his main heir and left him his workshop together with all his notebooks and drawings.



"
3313,"MEMBERGER, Kaspar the Elder","(b. ca. 1555, Konstanz, d. 1618, Konstanz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/memberge/biograph.html,"
Kaspar Memberger the Elder was a Swiss painter in Constance. He was the son of the painter Philipp Memberger the Elder (ca 1510- 1573). Like his two brothers, he was probably trained by his father. When summoned to Salzburg by Wolf Dietrich in 1587, he created impressive altarpieces, memorial plaques and portraits there. In the archiepiscopal papers and documents, the artist was not mentioned as a Salzburg court painter until 1596. Two years later, Memberger returned to Constance, where he died in 1618, an eminent and respected painter.

3315,"MEMMI, Lippo","(b. ca. 1285, Siena, d. ca. 1361, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/memmi/biograph.html,"

Italian painter. He was the son of Memmo di Filippuccio, the brother of Tederigho (also spelt Federigo) Memmi and, after 1324, brother-in-law of Simone and Donato Martini, all of whom were painters. He is known through signed works, documentary references and early secondary sources."
3316,MEMMO DI FILIPPUCCIO,(active 1288–1324),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/memmo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. He was the son of the goldsmith Filippuccio (active 1273-1293), and the father of the painter Lippo Memmi. In 1948 Longhi attributed a fresco of the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Sts James and John the Evangelist in the church of San Jacopo, San Gimignano, and others in the tower of the Palazzo del Popolo there to Memmo, who is documented as having lived and worked in the town from 1303 to 1317. A document of 1303 also records him as having worked in the upper church of San Francesco, Assisi, and Longhi suggested this might have been on the frescoes of the St Francis cycle, which would account for the Giottesque influence he had noted in the frescoes in San Gimignano. Further attributed to Memmo are the frescoes of Carlo d'Angio Administering Justice (1292; San Gimignano, Palazzo del Popolo, Sala dell'Udienza), an altarpiece of the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (Oristano, Palazzo Arcispedale), which also shows the influence of Giotto's work at Assisi, a Virgin and Child (Pisa, San Francesco) and a polyptych of the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints, formerly in the convent of S Chiara, San Gimignano (San Gimignano, Pinacoteca Civica)."
3317,"MENA, Pedro de","(b. 1628, Granada, d. 1688, Malaga)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mena/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor, son of Alonso de Mena, also a sculptor. He studied with his father and followed his style in the early part of his career. After the death of his father, he worked with Bernardo de Mora, who had moved to Granada in 1650. The arrival of Alonso Cano in 1652, however, caused a change in Mena's artistic direction; he and Mora began to collaborate directly with Cano, and this close working relationship left a permanent mark on both of the younger artists' styles. Mena's first important works are based on figures by Cano, who had been commissioned to produce four sculptures for the convent of the Angel Custodio: St Anthony of Padua, St Diego of Alcalá, St Peter of Alcántara and St Joseph (all 1656–57; Granada, Alhambra). These were executed by Mena, who managed to gain Cano's trust and to earn a significant place for himself among Granada's makers of religious images."
3318,"MÉNAGEOT, François-Guillaume","(b. 1744, London, d. 1816, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/menageot/biograph.html,"

He was the son of Augustin Ménageot (d 1784), an art dealer and adviser to Denis Diderot, and he studied with Jean-Baptiste-Henri Deshays and with François Boucher, whose bravura style and use of light, warm colours he adopted in his early works. He won the Prix de Rome in 1766 with Tomyris Plunging the Head of Cyrus into a Bowl of Blood (Paris, Ecole Normale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts). From 1769 to 1774 he was at the Académie de France in Rome. Having been approved (agréé) as a history painter by the Académie Royale in Paris in 1777, he exhibited at the Salon the Farewells of Polyxena to Hecuba (Chartres, Musée des Beaux-Arts), a vast already Neoclassical work that was warmly received. His morceau de réception was a powerfully classicizing work entitled Learning Resisting the Passage of Time (1780; Paris, Ecole Normale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts). A year later he triumphed at the Salon with the Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the Arms of Francis I (Amboise, Hôtel de Ville)."

Dalmatian/Italian painter. He is one of the best documented artists working in Zadar, whose name appears in about a hundred documents in the archives of the city. These documents, dated from 1385 to 1427, refer to specific commissions, many from private patrons, for a variety of artworks for a number of different churches. He designed also the tomb of the archbishop of the city, Nikola Matafar. As his name suggests, Meneghello originally hailed from Venice, where he probably trained before moving his workshop to Zadar. Apart from the large number of documents referring to his artistic commissions, little is known about him since none of his documented works survives."
3321,"MENESES OSORIO, Francisco","(b. ca. 1640, Sevilla, d. 1721, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meneses/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was a member of the Seville Academy 1666-73 and mayordomo 1668-69 when he presented an Immaculate Conception (now lost). He was very probably taught by Murillo whose style he closely imitated into the eighteenth century. In 1681 he assisted Murillo with the retable for the Capuchin Church, Cádiz, and after Murillo's death in 1682 Meneses completed the central Marriage of St Catherine (adding the cherubim) and executed the four lateral panels from Murillo's designs.

Italian painter. He was a pupil in Genoa of Giovanni Andrea de' Ferrari and perhaps also of Giulio Benso, from whom he acquired an inclination towards narrative and naturalism. Later he entered the workshop of Valerio Castello. About 1651 Merano went to Parma to study the works of Correggio and Parmigianino. Here he painted two oval frescoes of St Lucy and St Apollonia (both Parma, Santa Croce). These first works, stylistically still immature, were strongly influenced by 16th-century Emilian painters, especially Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli, as well as by Castello."

Dutch painter, who produced mostly portraits, genre scenes, and still-lifes. Not much biographical information is available on the life of the artist but his movement throughout The Netherlands in the 17th century is marked by his membership in various guilds, beginning in Delft in 1628 at the age of eighteen.  He later joined The Hague in 1637, where he likely remained until 1657-58, but for a brief stay in Dordrecht in 1640.

He first learned the glass painting craft, but soon turned to etching. It has been proved that he was Dietmar Meyer's apprentice in Zurich from 1610, but in 1611 he was already working for the Duke of Lotharingia. From 1612 to 1615 Merian was working for the French court before he returned to Basel.

Matthäus Merian the Elder, Swiss engraver and draftsman, one of the most important copperplate engravers and publishers of the 17th century. He first learned the glass painting craft, but soon turned to etching. It has been proved that he was Dietmar Meyer's apprentice in Zurich from 1610, but in 1611 he was already working for the Duke of Lotharingia. From 1612 to 1615 Merian was working for the French court before he returned to Basel.

Belgian painter, active in Antwerp. His oeuvre consists of portraits, interior scenes and still-lifes. Most of the artist's surviving works, such as Old woman with Cats (Stedelijke Musea, Bruges) and Still-Life with Shells (private collection), exhibit the same heightened refinement and virtuoso handling.

French printmaker. He was the illegitimate son of an Englishman, Dr. Charles Lewis Meryon, and Narcisse Chaspoux, a dancer at the Paris Opéra. He entered the French Navy in 1837. On a trip around the world he began sketching. Returning, he lived on a small inheritance and began to study painting, but a severe condition of colour-blindness drove him into colourless drawing and etching. He worked mainly on architectural subjects done in a severely romantic style. He is best known for his etchings of Paris 1850-54 that encompass straightforward topographical views along with romantic and disturbing fantasies."
3337,"MESA, Juan de","(b. 1583, Córdoba, d. 1627, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mesa/biograph.html,"
Juan de Mesa y Velasco, Spanish sculptor and architect.  He entered the workshop of Juan Martínez Montanés in Seville in 1606. Like his master, de Mesa's works were realistic rather than imaginative in form, his sculptures closely replicate the human form. This was in line with the Catholic Church's aesthetic program for the visual arts following the Council of Trent, which sought to make the arts accessible to the poorly educated by using realistic forms."

He spent two years in Graz, in the workshop of his other maternal uncle, the sculptor Philipp Jacob Straub. At the end of 1755 he matriculated at the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts, and became a pupil of Jacob Schletterer. Graduated, he got work at the imperial arms collection. Here, in the building's salon in 1760-63 he made his first known works of art, the bronze busts of the imperial couple and reliefs representing the heir of the crown and his wife. With these works he joined the Late Baroque art of courtly representation, which was under the determining influence of Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. To this trend belong two other, larger than lifesize tin statues representing the imperial couple, commissioned by Maria Theresia and executed between 1764 and 1766. Besides some other portraits he also made works with a religious subject. A number of statues commissioned by the Princess of Savoy have survived as well.

Hungarian painter. During his studies in Vienna and Munich, he learnt to paint landscapes in the academic style. After he had returned to Hungary, his style changed. He visited various parts of the Hungary. His landscapes of Lake Balaton and the Tisza in greyish shades have a misty look. He depicted peasants and fishermen in an intimate and idyllic manner. His style became less formal in the 1880s. He attempted to depict atmosphere in his pictures which linked him to Corot and French painting."

He was one of the first scholarship students admitted to the school of art sponsored by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and took classes there in 1877 and 1878. After spending several years illustrating magazine articles on the Zuni Indians of New Mexico, he decided to study abroad and in 1883 left for Paris.

(Jacques-)Clément Métezeau II, French architect, part of a family of architects. He was the third son of Thibaut Métezeau and brought up by his brother Louis in the latter's lodgings in the Galeries du Louvre. In 1610 Carlo Gonzaga, Duc de Nevers et de Rethel, employed him as inspector and architect, requesting designs for the new town of Charleville, which he wished to create in the principality of Arches (Ardennes). Clément designed the Place Ducale in the town centre on the model of the Place Royale in Paris. Charleville was laid out on a grid plan and surrounded by fortifications with bastions. Métezeau may also have drawn up the plans for the square that the Duke had built in front of his palace at Nevers."

The Hôtel d'Angoulême, begun in 1584 for Diane d'Angoulême, Henry II's illegitimate daughter, is attributed to him, and includes the city's first example of a colossal order comprising large Corinthian pilasters, almost certainly inspired by one of Philibert Delorme's plates."
3344,"METSU, Gabriel","(b. 1629, Leiden, d. 1667, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/metsu/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in his native Leiden, then in Amsterdam, where he had moved by 1657. Houbraken says he trained with Dou, but Metsu's early works are very different from his - typically historical and mythological scenes, broadly rather than minutely painted. Metsu also painted portraits and still-lifes, but his most characteristic works are genre scenes, some of which rank among the finest of their period. He concentrated on scenes of genteel middle-class life, fairly close to de Hooch and Terborch in style, but with a personal stamp. One of his best-known works, The Sick Child (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), is often compared with Vermeer. His work is rarely dated, so his development and relationships with other artists are difficult to trace.

German painter and engraver. He was born in Bonn, Germany in 1749, and worked in England and Italy. He was a pupil of Francesco Bartolozzi in London, before becoming a Royal Academician. Metz was renowned for beautiful classical illustrations, particularly of figures like Mars, Venus and Diana, best known by his numerous imitations and facsimiles of drawings by the old masters. He published in 1790 a set of thirty-three engravings after George III's collection of drawings by Parmigianino and in 1791 a set of sixty-three plates in a similar style, after the designs by Polidoro da Caravaggio. In 1802 left for Rome, where he was to engrave Michelangelo's Last Judgement. He died there in 1827.

Flemish painter and tapestry designer. He moved to Paris in 1664, became an assistant to Le Brun and was made one of Louis XIV court painters, specializing in military scenes. He accompanied the king on his campaigns, and his paintings and designs for Gobelins tapestries are accurate historical documents of the battles which they represent. His work of this type is well represented in Versailles. He also made much less grandiose pictures of such subjects as hunting parties and landscapes.



"
3348,"MEULEN, Steven van der",(active 1543-1568 in England),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meulen_s/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, active in England. He was a pupil of Willem van Cleve the younger (c. 1530-1564) in 1543 and was admitted to the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1552; by 1560 he had travelled to London, and he was naturalized in 1562. Van der Meulen brought with him a deep knowledge of the portrait style of Anthonis Mor. This sombre, shadowed style appealed to patrons at the English court who could not travel to Antwerp to sit to the greater artist. Early in 1561 an English merchant, John Dymoch, had visited Sweden in connection with negotiations for a marriage between Queen Elizabeth and Erik XIV, taking with him a Netherlandish painter described as 'Master Staffan', and it seems likely that this was van der Meulen. The King was much pleased with the resulting portrait of himself, for which he paid 100 daler; it was presented to the Queen in June. Its subsequent fate in England is not known, but it has been plausibly identified with a full-length at Gripsholm Castle, Mariefred, near Stockholm."

Belgian sculptor, painter and draughtsman. He was directed towards an artistic career by his elder brother, the engraver Jean-Baptiste Meunier (1821-1900). He entered the Académie des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, in September 1845 and studied under the sculptor Louis Jehotte (1804-1884) from 1848. In addition, in 1852 he attended the private studio of the sculptor Charles-Auguste Fraikin (1817-1893). Gradually he came to feel that sculpture, at least in the traditional form taught in Brussels, was incapable of providing an adequate vehicle for either exposition or expression. Still at the Academy, he transferred to painting, therefore, in 1853, and followed the courses given by François-Joseph Navez, studying in the evenings at the Saint-Luc studio, with Charles De Groux (1825-1870)."
3351,"MEYNIER, Charles","(b. 1768, Paris, d. 1832, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/meynier/biograph.html,"
French painter and collector. His father intended that he should become a tailor, but he showed an early love for drawing and was allowed to study with the engraver Pierre-Philippe Choffard (1730-1809). He was a proficient student but nevertheless wished to become a painter, so his elder brother Meynier St-Phal, an actor at the Comédie-Française in Paris, paid for him to train from 1785 with François-André Vincent, who then enjoyed a considerable reputation. In 1789 he won the Prix de Rome for Joseph Recognized by his Brothers (1789; École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris), jointly with Anne-Louis Girodet. The events of the French Revolution prevented him spending the usual five years in Rome, but his time there (till 1793) allowed him to make numerous studies of antique sculpture."

Most of his paintings are small-scale cabinet pictures, some on copper. They depict landscapes, river views, scenes of winter, markets and villages, peopled with tiny figures strolling or working, sometimes celebrating or drinking, often dressed in blue or red and accompanied by a few animals. Typical examples include Landscape with a Group of Farmers (Valenciennes, Musée des Beaux-Arts), Landscape (Brunswick, Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum) and Landscape with Figures (Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten)."

French painter. He came from a humble background, his father being an employee at the market of Les Halles in Paris. At an early age, a farmer general, M. de Chalue, took an interest in him and found him a place with the curate of Veruts, on the plain of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. It was here that he first developed a love of the countryside. In 1775 he was apprenticed to a mediocre history painter called Leduc, but he preferred to go off and sketch out of doors. In order to assist him, M. de Berchigny, Colonel in the Hussars, engaged him in his regiment garrisoned in Normandy and arranged for him to take lessons in art. He remained there for more than a year and then returned to Paris, where he worked with M. de Grammont-Voulgy, who was Steward to the brother of Louis XVI. In 1789 Grammont-Voulgy took him to Switzerland, and Michel also visited Germany, where he stayed with the Duc de Guiche."
3356,MICHELANGELO Buonarroti,"(b. 1475, Caprese, d. 1564, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/michelan/biograph.html,"Michelangelo (full name: Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni) was born at Caprese, a village in Florentine territory, where his father, named Ludovico Buonarroti Simoni was the resident magistrate. A few weeks after Michelangelo's birth the family returned to Florence, and, in 1488, after overcoming parental opposition he was formally apprenticed to Domenico Ghirlandaio for a term of three years. Later in life Michelangelo tried to suppress this fact, probably to make it seem that he had never had an ordinary workshop training; for it was he more than anyone else who introduced the idea of the 'Fine Arts' having no connection with the craft that painting had always previously been. His stay in the Ghirlandaio shop must also have coincided with his beginning to work as a sculptor in the Medici Garden, where antiques from their collection were looked after by Bertoldo. Although this connection drew him into the Medici circle as a familiar, the account by Vasari of an established 'school' is now discredited. It must, however, have been Ghirlandaio who taught him the elements of fresco technique, and it was probably also in that shop that he made his drawings after the great Florentine masters of the past (copies after Giotto and Masaccio; now in the Louvre, in Munich, and in Vienna). Michelangelo produced at least two relief sculptures by the time he was 16 years old, the Battle of the Centaurs and the Madonna of the Stairs (both 1489-92, Casa Buonarroti, Florence), which show that he had achieved a personal style at a very early age.

He was an assistant in Lorenzo Ghiberti's workshop during the execution of the north door of the Baptistery in Florence (1404-07), and the influence of Ghiberti is apparent throughout his work, which largely consists of small-scale terracotta sculpture. He remained in Florence during the 1420s and probably established his own workshop, producing a vast number of small devotional reliefs in terracotta, originally polychromed and gilt, such as the Virgin and Child with Angels beneath a Niche (c. 1420; Prato, Museo Comune). These almost certainly were executed in serial fashion for sale to private clients. Michele is credited with the terracotta tomb of Francesco Roselli (c. 1430; Arezzo, S Francesco)"

Italian painter (Michele di Matteo da Bologna; or da Calcina or da Fornace). He is first documented in 1410, when he collaborated with Francesco Lola (1393-1419) in the design of decorations to celebrate the arrival of the anti-pope Alexander V (reg 1409-10) in Bologna. His name appears on the register of the Quattro Arti in 1415 and various minor works by him are documented in the following years, including the decoration, in 1418, of a flag (untraced). In 1426 he executed his first important work, a polyptych (untraced) for the Compagnia dei Calzolari, Bologna. In 1428 Michele was working with Giovanni da Modena and Pietro Lianori (fl 1446-60), and their influence is reflected in the dry, incisive drawing style and harshness of expression in both face and gesture that can be seen, for example, in the Death of the Virgin and St Bartholomew and the Emperor Constantine (both Pesaro, Museo Civivico), the Coronation of the Virgin (Pisa, Museo Nazionale di San Matteo) and the frescoes of the Road to Calvary and the Crucifixion in S Stefano, Bologna.

Hungarian painter, active in Italy. He was one of the most important painters at the court of Ferrara in the mid-15th century and contributed to the creation of an indigenous Ferrarese style of painting. From 1415 onward he seems to have worked at Ferrara and is mentioned in the records as Michele Ongaro, one of the court painters of Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Most of his works have been destroyed. He may have been born in Hungary, as his name implies. There are parallels between his style and that of contemporary painters working in Hungary, but nothing is known of his early career. The Michel da Ungaria, recorded as one of Gentile da Fabriano's assistants working in the Strozzi Chapel in the sacristy of Santa Trinità, Florence, in 1423, may be the same artist.

Italian painter and illuminator. Milanese writers from the humanist Uberto Decembrio (1350–1427) to Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo in the 16th century described Michelino as the greatest artist of his time. He was especially praised for his skill and prodigious talent in the naturalistic portrayal of animals and birds. Records of payments made in 1388 to a 'Michelino pictore' who painted scenes from the Life of St Augustine in the second cloister of the Augustinian convent of S Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, Pavia, are thought to be the earliest references to the artist. He was still resident in Pavia in 1404, when the Fabbrica of Milan Cathedral decided to consult him as 'the greatest in the arts of painting and design'. The frescoes in S Pietro in Ciel d'Oro and a panel by Michelino dated 1394 that was in S Mustiola, Pavia, in the 17th century have not survived, but two of the manuscripts with illumination firmly attributed to Michelino date from his time in Pavia: St Augustine's Commentary on the Psalms (Rome, Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica), which was probably made for Marco Gallina, an Augustinian professor of theology at Pavia University, in 1396, and the Funeral Eulogy and Genealogy of Giangaleazzo Visconti (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris), dated 1403."

He studied with his father, Wolfgang Mielich, a Munich municipal painter, who appears in the Munich tax records from 1509 onwards, but the years 1536-39, spent with Albrecht Altdorfer in Regensburg, were decisive for Hans Mielich's approach to colour. In 1536 he illuminated the title-page to the Freiheitenbuch of the city of Regensburg (Regensburg, Stadtmuseum). In 1541 Mielich travelled to Rome on a commission from Duke William IV of Bavaria. He stayed there until 1543, when he became a master in Munich. From 1545 onwards Duke Albert V of Bavaria helped him obtain commissions, and in 1558 Mielich became leader of the Munich painters' guild.

Dutch painter, the son and apprentice of the Leiden painter Frans van Mieris. He grew up in the tradition of the 'fijnschilders'. He adopted his father's smooth, enamel-like style, but besides genre pieces also produced portraits, landscapes and history pieces. After 1700 Van Mieris specialised in shop and kitchen interiors depicted behind an arched opening. He devoted much attention to detail, and many important collectors liked his dispassionate, meticulous style. For several years Van Mieris was leader of the St Luke's guild in Leiden. Around 1694 he set up a drawing academy with the artists Toorenvliet and De Moor. His apprentices included his son, Frans van Mieris II. The school remained in existence until 1736, by which time Van Mieris had become partially blind.



"
3373,"MIGEON, Pierre II","(b. 1701, Paris, d. 1758, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/migeon/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker. He was the son of the cabinetmaker Pierre Migeon I (b. c. 1670). He started work in 1726, as his day-book (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris), originally attributed to his father, indicates. As much a dealer as a craftsman, Migeon sold a large number of luxury objects to a cosmopolitan clientele, and subcontracted extensively to colleagues. He carried out many commissions for the Garde Meuble de la Couronne, both directly and through the cabinetmakers Antoine-Robert Gaudreaus and Gilles Joubert."
3374,"MIGLIARA, Giovanni","(b. 1785, Alessandria, d. 1837, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/migliara/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and teacher. He began his career as a scene painter with Gaspare Galiari (1761-1823) in Milan, working at the Teatro Carcano in 1804 and at La Scala from 1805 to 1809. Owing to illness, after 1810 he turned to small-scale works in watercolour or oil using various supports, including silk and ivory. At this date Milanese painting was dominated by Andrea Appiani and Luigi Sabatelli, both leading Neo-classical artists. However, Migliara remained aloof from this dominant movement and instead drew on medieval and historical subjects with Romantic undertones. His precise, jewel-like technique and choice of subject-matter found favour with aristocratic patrons in Milan. His figures are generally stilted and burdened by their costumes, though the crowd in Sacking of Minister Prina's House (1814; Milan, Galleria d'Arte Moderna) is depicted with unusual fluency."
3375,"MIGNARD, Nicolas","(b. 1606, Troyes, d. 1668, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mignard/nicolas/biograph.html,"
French painter, the elder brother of the much better-known Pierre Mignard. He executed much of his work in Provence. His style was colder and drier than that of his brother, but showed the same attention to drawing. His compositions tended to be based on Italian models.



"
3376,"MIGNARD, Pierre","(b. 1612, Troyes, d. 1695, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mignard/pierre/biograph.html,"
French painter who was the rival of Le Brun but an exponent of the same Academic theories. Like Le Brun he was a pupil of Vouet, but he went to Rome in 1636 and remained there until 1657, forming his style on the approved models of the Carracci, Domenichino and Poussin. He returned to Paris on the orders of Louis XIV and decorated the dome of the Val-de-Grâce (1663), but his principal importance was as portrait painter to the Court. He revived the earlier Italian type of allegorical portrait, and a good example is the Marquise de Seignelay as Thetis (1691, London, National Gallery)."
3377,"MIGNON, Abraham","(b. 1640, Frankfurt, d. 1679, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mignon/biograph.html,"
Abraham Mignon was born in 1640, the son of French-Reformed emigrants living
in Frankfurt am Main. There he became the pupil of Jacob Marrel, who had himself
studied under Georg Flegel and Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Mignon accompanied his
teacher on a number of journeys to Holland, finally moving in 1667 to Utrecht,
where he joined de Heem's studio and in 1669 became a member of the St Lukas
Guild. Returned to Frankfurt in 1676 where Maria Sibylle Merian became one of his pupils."

Hieronymus van der Mij (also spelt My), Dutch painter, active in Leiden. He was the eldest son of Philip van der Mij (1654-1721), a caster of sculptures and vases, known for some monumental garden vases designed by his fellow townsman Willem van Mieris. Hieronymus was trained by Willem van Mieris as a painter. Nevertheless he entered the Leiden university at 22 in 1710. Like Rembrandt a century before him, van der Mij was registered as a student in his city of birth for the privileges and exemptions connected with the academic status, without ever attending any classes. It took to 1724 until the artist entered the Saint Lucas-guild of Leiden, the same guild his father entered in 1702."

George van der Mijn, Dutch painter, part of a family of artists, also active in England. Heroman van der Mijn was a portrait and still-life painter of some distinction, although his work shows little originality. His sister Agatha van der Mijn (active early 18th century) painted similar subjects and accompanied her brother to England shortly after 1721. Six of Heroman's children became painters: his daughter Cornelia van der Mijn (b. 1710) and his sons Gerard van der Mijn (b. 1706), Andreas van der Mijn (b. ?1714), Frans van der Mijn (1719-93), George van der Mijn and Robert van der Mijn (b. 1724), of whom only Frans and George established important reputations.

Heroman van der Mijn was a pupil of Ernst Stuven (1660-1712). After his marriage in 1706, he lived in Amsterdam, then in Antwerp (1712-13) and finally in Düsseldorf, where he worked for the Elector Palatine, John William. In 1716, after the Elector's death, van der Mijn returned to Antwerp and thence went to London."

Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, nephew of Daniel Mijtens I. In 1677 he moved to Sweden, where he became one of the most important portrait painters of this period. He painted the nobility, gentry and priesthood but not royalty, the position of court painter being held by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl (1628-1698)."

Austrian painter, member of a family of painters of Flemish origin (spelled also Mijtens; Mytens). He began his artistic studies with his father, the painter Martin Meytens the Elder, who had moved from The Hague to Sweden. He went rather early on a study trip. He visited London, Paris and Vienna, then he lived and worked for a long time in Italy (Rome, Turin). At the beginning he painted little enamel miniature portraits, and he changed to oil painting only around 1730, having settled in Vienna. Here he became very popular as a portrait painter in the circles of the court and the aristocracy. In 1732 be became a court painter, and in 1759 the director of the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts."
3387,"MILAN, Pierre",(active 1545-1557 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/milan/biograph.html,"
French medallist and engraver. He is first recorded in 1545 and was working as an assistant to the medallist Marc Béchot (c. 1520-57) in 1547. His prints are unsigned and were for a long time attributed to René Boyvin, who was his pupil in 1549-50. He has been identified with the copper-plate engraver Pierre de La Cuffle, who is mentioned by Karel van Mander I. He was often in debt and was several times obliged to pledge his plates to his creditors, who included François Clouet. He remained in close contact with Boyvin, who in 1553 finished two plates begun by Milan. They worked together on the inventory drawn up on the death of Luca Penni in 1557."
3388,"MILANI, Aureliano","(b. 1675, Bologna, d. 1749, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/milani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and engraver. He was distantly related to the Carracci family and zealous to revive their style for his generation of Bolognese artists. As a young artist, trained briefly by his uncle Giulio Cesare Milani and then by Lorenzo Pasinelli and Cesare Gennari, he undertook a long and diligent study of the celebrated fresco cycles by the Carracci in the Palazzo Magnani and the Palazzo Fava in Bologna. He was given free access to the Fava palace, and financial assistance, by Count Alessandro Fava. Milani also made copies, in both drawing and painting, of major pictures by the Carracci in Bologna and emulated the vigorous rhythmic articulation of musculature and contour that they used to convey the powerful energy of the male figure in movement."
3389,"MILDERT, Johannes van","(b. 1588, Königsberg, d. 1638, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mildert/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. He was the son of the Antwerp painter Anthoon van Mildert (d. 1597) who had migrated to Königsberg. He was probably the pupil of Willem van den Blocke (c. 1550-1628), another Fleming who had settled in Königsberg."

Austrian painter. He was born into a known Tyrolese painter family. He moved at an early date to the imperial city to earn his living, like so many of his fellow countrymen. Between 1740 and 1742 he studied at the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts, where in 1742 he won a competition prize, and in 1751, following the artistic approach and example of his fellow Tyrolese painter Paul Troger, he became an academic professor. He won fame and great commissions in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Hungary as a fresco and altarpiece painter."
3391,"MILHOMME, François-Dominique-Aimé","(b. 1758, Valenciennes, d. 1823, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/milhomme/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He was trained in the Valenciennes studio of the local sculptor Pierre-Joseph Gillet and later became the pupil in Paris of André-Jean Lebrun and  Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain.

Serbian painter, born near Shkodër in Albania in 1877. After he came to Belgrade, he studied painting at the school of Kirilo Kutlik (1869–1900). Later he went to Prague, Vienna and than Munich. He fought in World War I as a soldier, and later as a war painter of High Command in Corfu island. The paintings he made in Corfu are representative examples of Serbian Impressionism. He worked as a teacher in a school in Belgrade and was a member of ""Lada"" art association. 



"
3393,"MILLAIS, Sir John Everett","(b. 1829, Southampton, d. 1896, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/millais/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was in the Royal Academy Schools in 1840 - an infant prodigy. In 1848, he, Hunt and Rossetti founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; his Christ in the House of His Parents (1850, Tate Gallery, London) was savagely attacked by Charles Dickens, but Ruskin defended him and the Brotherhood generally. In 1853 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy. In 1855 he married Ruskin's former wife, and his friendship with Ruskin was broken off. Millais developed into a fashionable and technically brilliant academic painter of portraits, costume history and genre pieces, forsaking his original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood theories, and went on to become Royal Academician (1863), and President in 1896, just before his death. He was made a baronet in 1885.



"
3394,"MILLER, Sanderson","(b. 1716, Radway, d. 1780, Radway)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/miller/biograph.html,"

3395,"MILLET, Jean-François","(b. 1814, Gruchy, d. 1875, Barbizon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/millet/biograph.html,"
French painter, the son of a peasant. He was trained under a local painter at Cherbourg and then in Paris (1837) under Delaroche. His earliest works are pastiches of the pastorals of the 18th century and rather erotic nudes, but he also painted portraits for a time. The influence of Daumier seems to have been decisive, and in 1848 he exhibited at the Salon a peasant subject, The Winnower (London, National Gallery; versions are in Paris, Louvre)."
3396,"MILLET, Aimé","(b. 1819, Paris, d. 1891, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/millet_a/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. Son of a miniature painter, he studied at the Petite Ecole (Ecole Gratuite de Dessin) and the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, where he was a student of David d'Angers. He moved in Romantic circles both during and after his student years and became a close friend of the poet Gérard de Nerval. Belated success came in 1857 when his statue of Ariadne (marble version, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) won a first-class medal at the Salon."
3397,"MILLET, Francisque","(b. 1642, Antwerpen, d. 1679, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/millet_f/biograph.html,"
Jean François Millet, called Francisque, worked in Paris from 1659, painting landscapes in the style of Gaspard Dughet. He was received into the French Academy in Paris in 1763, after having worked in the Low Countries and in England. He can lay claim to being the best interpreter of Nicolas Poussin's classical landscapes, retaining the formality and dignity of his models without loss of subtlety."
3398,"MINARDI, Tommaso","(b. 1787, Faenza, d. 1871, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/minardi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, illustrator, and author, Tommaso Minardi began his career as a pupil of Giuseppe Zauli. His initial activity in Rome consisted in ten years of employment with the engraver Giuseppe Longhi, for whom he did reproduction drawings of Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; in addition, he studied the works of Leonardo and Raphael. In 1819, on behest of the neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova, Minardi was named director of the Academy in Perugia. From 1821 to 1858, he was employed as an instructor at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome.



"
3399,"MINDERHOUT, Hendrik van","(b. 1632, Rotterdam, d. 1696, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/minderho/biograph.html,"
Hendrik van Minderhout, a painter of seascapes, came from Rotterdam. By the age of twenty, he had already established himself in Bruges where he lived twenty years before moving to Antwerp in 1672. His seascapes and harbour views show vast, cloud-filled skies with galleons riding above the horizon, their sails billowing and their flags fluttering in the breeze. Van Minderhout used his props in these models of baroque luxuriousness to create a sense of exoticism and drama.



"
3400,"MINIO, Tiziano","(b. ca. 1511, Padova, d. 1552, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/minio/biograph.html,"
Tiziano Aspetti, known by his nickname Tiziano Minio, Italian stuccoist and sculptor. He probably trained as a founder under his father, Guido Minio (active 1511-16), called Lizzaro, and later alternated this trade with his work as a sculptor. After learning bronze casting, he acquired training as a stuccoist under Giovanni Maria Mosca (1493-ca.1573)."
3401,MINO DA FIESOLE,"(b. 1429, Poppi, d. 1484, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mino/biograph.html,"
Florentine sculptor. According to Vasari he was a pupil of Desiderio da Settignano, but this has been doubted, as Desiderio was about the same age - possibly a year or so younger. Mino is remembered mainly for his portrait busts. Whereas Desiderio's are all of women, Mino's are almost all of men; the earliest - that of Piero de Medici (Bargello, Florence, 1453) - is the first dated portrait bust of the Renaissance. Mino also worked as a tomb sculptor, but much of his work in this field has been altered or destroyed or is of uncertain attribution because he collaborated with other sculptors. The one that most clearly shows his own workmanship is that of Count Hugo of Tuscany (Badia, Florence, completed 1481), which Vasari describes as 'the most beautiful work that he ever produced'. Mino had three documented stays in Rome (1454, 1463, and 1474-80) and also worked briefly in Naples (1455). His reputation was at its height in the 19th century, when his delicate carving of marble was much admired.




"
3402,"MIQUE, Richard","(b. 1728, Nancy, d. 1794, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mique/biograph.html,"
French architect. He was the favourite architect of Marie-Antoinette and he is most remembered for his picturesque hamlet, the Hameau de la Reine, built for Marie Antoinette in the Petit Trianon gardens within the estate of Palace of Versailles."
3403,"MIR TRINXET, Joaquím","(b. 1873, Barcelona, d. 1940, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mir/biograph.html,"
Spanish Catalan painter. A pupil of Lluis Graner (1863-1929), he also studied at the Escola de Belles Arts (Llotja) of Barcelona (1894-95). Mir was a member of la Colla del Safrà, a group of young artists who painted the fields in the countryside outside Barcelona. The Cathedral of the Poor (1898; private collection) is among his most important works of this period: it is a realistic group portrait of beggars near Antoni Gaudí's Temple de la Sagrada Familia during its construction in Barcelona."
3404,"MIROU, Anthonie","(b. ca. 1570, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1661, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mirou/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman. Around 1580, various painters of his name were registered as members of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. His Protestant family, like many others from Flanders and Brabant, took refuge from religious persecution in Frankenthal, under the protection of the Elector Palatine and staunch Calvinist, Frederick III. Mirou's father, the apothecary Hendrik Mirou, is documented repeatedly in Frankenthal from 1586. On 8 May 1602 Antoine married Suzanna van Coninxloo there, and he is frequently mentioned in the local archives until 1620, when he presumably returned to Antwerp. He is counted among the most distinguished of the landscape artists often referred to as the Frankenthal School, the best known of whom is Gillis van Coninxloo. Van Coninxloo had a strong influence on Mirou's style, either through direct contact or, more probably, via the work of another Frankenthal artist, Pieter Schoubroeck.


"
3405,"MISERONI, Dionysio","(b. ca. 1607, d. 1661, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/miseroni/dionysio/biograph.html,"
Italian lapidary artist, part of an important dynasty of stonecutters ennobled in 1608 from Milan. His father, Ottavio Miseroni settled in Prague. Dionysio and his brother Jeronimo trained in their father's workshop. Dionysio succeeded his father at his death and thirteen years later he became Imperial Treasure Warden in the Hradschin Palace in Prague."
3406,"MISERONI, Gasparo","(b. ca. 1518, Milano, d. 1573, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/miseroni/gasparo/biograph.html,"
The Miseroni family produced six generations of lapidary artists, starting with Francesco in 1460 in Milan and ending with Ferdinand Eusebios's death in Prague in 1684. Many cups in nephrite jade were made by them for Princes and Emperors and some of them can be still admired today in museums and private collections."

3408,"MITELLI, Agostino","(b. 1609, Battidizzo, d. 1660, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mitelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He and his collaborator Angelo Michele Colonna are renowned as pre-eminent exponents of quadratura, the painting of illusionistic architectural perspectives. They learnt this art from Girolamo Curti (1575-1632), who had made a speciality of it in Bologna. The two artists created a range of ceiling enframements and decorative ensembles that were architecturally the most unified and rational of their time. This achievement, recognized as the 'Bolognese style', was widely applauded and imitated until the advent of Neo-classicism, when it was criticized for excesses and violations of architectural probity.



"
3409,"MOCHI, Francesco","(b. 1580, Montevarchi, d. 1654, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mochi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, strongly influenced by Florentine styles, who worked in Florence, Orvieto, Rome and Piacenza. He collaborated with Camillo Mariani at San Bernardo alle Terme in Rome. He failed to consolidate his reputation in Rome, and his employment by the Farnese family meant that he passed many of the years between 1612 and 1629 in their fiefdom of Piacenza. When he returned to Rome in 1629, Mochi was effectively marginalized by Gianlorenzo Bernini.
"
3410,"MOCHI, Orazio","(b. 1571, Firenze, d. 1625, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mochi_o/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was long thought to have been the father of Francesco Mochi. This misconception lingers, even in many modern publications, and is doubtless due to the fact that he did indeed have a sculptor son called Francesco Mochi (1603-1649), but - like his brother Stefano Mochi - he was a minor figure, and his work is virtually unknown."
3411,MODERNO,"(b. 1467, Verona, d. 1528, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moderno/biograph.html,"
Italian plaquette designer and gem-engraver (originally Galeazzo Mondella). A coherent group of 12 plaquette designs (from some 45 currently credited to this master: National Gallery of Art, Washington, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) are signed with initials or contractions of MODERNUS FECIT or OPUS MODERNI: both the signed and attributed groups establish a claim for the recognition of their author as the most accomplished designer of plaquettes in Italy in the Renaissance. References to the art of the western Veneto in the early work and to that of Venice in later examples make it virtually certain that Moderno was Galeazzo Mondella of Verona. The plaquettes display an intimate awareness of preceding and contemporary Veronese art, with special loyalties to Andrea Mantegna, the Falconetto family, Francesco Bonsignori and Liberale da Verona. Galeazzo's brother Girolamo Mondella (1464-1512) was a painter and an intimate of the Este court at Ferrara."
3412,"MOEYAERT, Claes Cornelisz.","(b. 1591, Durgerdam, d. 1655, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moeyaert/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, etcher and draughtsman. He was the son of an aristocratic Catholic Amsterdam merchant and moved to the city with his family in 1605. He was the most prolific of the history painters now called the Pre-Rembrandtists, whose representations of biblical and mythological narratives, as well as of more recent secular history, give particular emphasis to dramatic and psychological effects. After working initially as a draughtsman and etcher, Moeyaert soon made his name as a painter. Landscapes with animals feature prominently in both his etchings and his paintings. At first he followed the lead of Adam Elsheimer, then of fellow Pre-Rembrandtists Pieter Lastman and Jan and Jacob Pynas, eventually, in the mid-1630s, coming under the influence of Rembrandt himself."
3413,"MOIGNIEZ, Jules","(b. 1835, Senlis, d. 1894, Saint-Martin-du-Tertre)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moigniez/biograph.html,"
French animalier sculptor. He was a student of Paul Comolera (1818-1897) and his attraction to bird sculpture comes from his studies with his teacher. His most plentiful subjects were game birds but he sculpted dogs, horses and a few equestrian groups. Moigniez's first recorded exhibit was at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1855, at the age of twenty. He exhibited regularly at the annual Salons from 1859 until 1892 showing a total of thirty works. He also exhibited in England at the London International Exhibition of 1862 where he found a very receptive audience. Moigniez was very successful in France as well as England and America where the majority of his game bird sculptures were sold."

The greatest still-life painter of the French seventeenth century. She spent her long career in Paris, specializing specifically in still-life pictures with the occasional figure. She came from a strictly Calvinist family. In 1640 she married the wealthy timber merchant Etienne Girardot de Chancourt, also a Huguenot."
3415,"MOINE, Antonin-Marie","(b. 1796, Saint-Etienne, d. 1849, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moine/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter. He was a pupil of Pierre Révoil in Lyon, then of Anne-Louis Girodet and Antoine-Jean Gros at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris from 1817, initially studying painting. He showed an early interest in the sculpture of the French Renaissance, and many of his works have a linear grace that owes much to the school of Fontainebleau and the sculpture of Cellini.


"
3416,"MOITTE, Jean-Guillaume","(b. 1746, Paris, d. 1810, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moitte/jean/biograph.html,"
Sculptor and draughtsman, part of a French family of artists, son of Pierre-Etienne Moitte. He first trained in Jean-Baptiste Pigalle's studio, and later in that of Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. In 1768 he won the Prix de Rome for sculpture and stayed in Rome from October 1771 to May 1773, before making a slow start to his career, chiefly with drawing. In particular, he drew for Robert-Joseph Auguste designs for silver- and goldsmith's work. In 1783 Moitte was finally accepted (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and obtained commissions for several statues and low reliefs (1784; in situ) for the Hotel de Salm (now Palais de la Légion d'Honneur)."
3417,"MOITTE, Pierre-Etienne","(b. 1722, Paris, 1780, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moitte/pierre/biograph.html,"
French engraver, part of a family of artists. He studied in Paris with Jacques-Firmin Beauvarlet and Pierre-François Beaumont (1719-?69). He was accepted (agréé) in 1771 by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and subsequently signed his prints 'Graveur du Roi'. Between c. 1747 and 1754 he was one of the principal engravers commissioned to work for the 'Cabinet de S.E.M. Le Comte de Brühl,' a collection published in Dresden in 1754 and consisting of 50 plates after selected paintings from the celebrated collection owned by Heinrich von Brühl. In addition to the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine after Correggio and three history subjects after Jean-Baptiste Corneille, Moitte contributed 11 masterly pieces after Dutch and Flemish paintings, including the Dutch Merchant and the Flemish Cook after Gerrit Dou; the Broken Egg, after Frans van Mieris the Elder; the Judgement of Paris after Rubens; four landscapes after Jacob van Ruisdael and Guillam Dubois (c. 1610-80); and Travellers' Rest and Horses at the Watering Trough after Philips Wouwerman."
3418,"MOJA, Federico","(b. 1802, Milano, d. 1885, Dolo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moja/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born into a family of artists, Moja began studying at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in 1818 and became a pupil of Giovanni Migliara at the same time. His early work is characterised by perspective urban views, monastery interiors and subjects of a historical and literary nature addressed in strict accordance with his master's teachings."
3419,"MOL, Pieter van","(b. 1599, Antwerpen, d. 1650, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mol/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Once mistakenly considered a pupil of Rubens, he was actually an apprentice in 1611 with the little-known painter Siger van der Graeve and was received as master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1622. It was suggested that Artus Wolffort, a minor follower of Peter Paul Rubens, may also have been van Mol's master. Some of van Mol's early paintings such as the Deposition (Reims, Musée St Denis) are stylistically close to Artus Wolffordt's oeuvre."
3420,"MOLA, Pier Francesco","(b. 1612, Coldrerio, d. 1666, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mola/biograph.html,"
Italian Baroque painter, active mainly in Rome. Although he trained there with Cesari and in Bologna with Albani, his style, characterized by warm colouring and soft modelling, was formed mainly on the example of Guercino and Venetian art (his early career is not well documented, but he probably spent most of the period 1633-47 in north Italy). He painted frescoes in Roman churches and palaces, and his best-known painting is the striking Barbary Pirate (Louvre, Paris, 1650), but his most characteristic works are fairly small canvases with religious or mythological figures set in landscapes. They are somewhat reminiscent of Albani, but much freer, and closer in spirit to Salvator Rosa, with whom Mola was one of the chief representatives of a distinctively romantic strain in Roman painting in the mid 17th century.



"
3421,"MOLA, Antonio and Paolo","(known from 1489, died 1532 and 1545)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mola_ap/biograph.html,"
Italian makers of intarsia in wood, and sculptors in marble, the brothers Antonio and Paolo Mola were of Mantuan origin. They were active in Carpi, in Mantua where they worked under the guidance of Giulio Romano, and in Venice, where they created inlays for the sacristy of St. Mark's Basilica and marble sculptures for the Palazzo Ducale.



"
3422,"MOLENAER, Bartholomeus","(b. 1618, Haarlem, d. 1650, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molenaer/bartholo/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, brother of Jan Miense Molenaer and cousin of Klaes (Nicolaes) Molenaer. He joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1640. He was a genre painter who painted many peasant interiors.



"
3423,"MOLENAER, Jan Miense","(b. ca. 1610, Haarlem, d. 1668, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molenaer/jan/biograph.html,"
Dutch genre painter, active from 1629, who married Judith Leyster in 1636. He spent his time in Haarlem and Amsterdam and his earlier works, like those of his wife, are strongly influenced by Frans Hals. The later pictures are more like the genre scenes of Adriaen van Ostade. There are works by him in Amsterdam, Berlin, Boston, Brussels, Frankfurt (Städel), Haarlem, The Hague, London (National Gallery), Stockholm and Vienna.



"
3424,"MOLENAER, Klaes","(b. before 1630, Haarlem, d. 1676, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molenaer/klaes/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (name variants: Nicolaes or Claes, Molenaar), the cousin of Jan Miense Molenaer. He joined the Guild of St Luke in Haarlem in 1651 and worked there his whole life. He specialized in landscapes and genre scenes, painting skating scenes, peasants outside taverns, and coastal views. His early works show the influence of Jan van Goyen and he is thought to have studied with Salomon van Ruysdael. His later work was strongly influenced by his contemporary and fellow Haarlem artist Jacob van Ruisdael.


"
3425,"MOLIN, Johann Peter","(b. 1814, Göteborg.d. 1873, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molin/biograph.html,"
Swedish sculptor. His father was a baker in Gothenburg. In 1843 he studied with Herman Wilhelm Bissen in Copenhagen. Later he stayed in Paris then spent eight years in Rome. His fame was established when Karl XV bought one of his works in 1847."
3426,"MOLINARI, Antonio","(b. 1655, Venezia, d.1704, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molinari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. Son of Giovanni Battista Molinari (1636-after 1682), a painter, he apprenticed with Antonio Zanchi in Venice. His style had its origins in the naturalism and tenebrism of Neapolitan painting, introduced to Venice in the mid-17th century. Although his work always retained some traces of this naturalism, the typically violent subject-matter and intensity of the Neapolitan style were considerably tempered by the addition of classicising elements and of rich, glowing colours."
3427,"MOLINERI, Giovanni Antonio","(b. 1577, Savigliano di Cuneo, d. ca. 1645, Savigliano di Cuneo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molineri/biograph.html,"
Italian late-Mannerist painter, called Il Carraccino. He probably came to Rome at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and is documented there until 1615. His sojourn saw him evolve within the world of Caravaggio, as attested by a document which proves his direct contact with Bartolomeo Manfredi. However, only works painted after his return from Rome appear to be known. In 1621, he signed the frescoes in the church of San Pietro in Savigliano."
3428,"MOLITOR, Bernard","(b. 1755, Betzdorf, d. 1810, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molitor/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker, born in Betzdorf, Luxembourg, to Nikolaus Molitor, a miller, and Margarete Lemmer. He was in Paris by 1778, then in 1784 he went to London, and because a number of pieces of Molitor's furniture betray a familiarity with English forms and techniques, it can be assumed that he was there several times during his apprenticeship years."
3429,"MOLLER, Georg","(b. 1784, Diepholz, d. 1852, Darmstadt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moller/biograph.html,"
German architect, a descendant of an old Norwegian family of clergy, who were known in the 17th century for publishing evangelical songbooks."
3430,"MOLLI, Clemente","(b. ca. 1599, Bologna, d. 1664, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was a sculptor with diverse interests, including architecture, poetry, and painting, in which he was expert and dealer. In the period before his Venetian work he had been active in Emilia and Romagna, sculpting in marble and in stucco, and had probably brought his own artistic culture up to date with a journey to Rome. With his altar in the Widmann Chapel in the church of San Canciano he introduced novel features to Venetian sculpture which can be traced back to his Bolognese background, including familiarity with the plastic and pictorial models of Guido Reni."
3431,"MOLYN, Pieter de","(b. 1595, London, d. 1661, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/molyn/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape painter, active mainly in Haarlem. With Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael, also active in Haarlem, he ranks as one of the pioneers of naturalistic landscape painting in Holland. It is not known if these three painters worked together, if they arrived at similar solutions independently, or if one of them began experiments with monochromatic pictures of dunes and cottages and the others followed his lead. Molyn's later career was less distinguished, and he seems then to have worked more as a draughtsman then a painter. He also etched.



"
3432,"MOMMERS, Hendrick","(b. ca. 1623, Haarlem, d. 1693, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mommers/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, a specialist in painting vegetable market scenes. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke in 1647, where he was last registered in 1665 when he appears to have moved to Amsterdam. He was a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem whose style of Italianate landscapes he followed, and is even registered as working in Italy, but it is unknown when he was there or with whom. Dirk Maas was his pupil.



"
3433,"MOMPER, Frans de","(b. 1603, Antwerpen, d. 1660, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/momper/frans/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, nephew of Josse de Momper II. In 1629 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He left Antwerp for the northern Netherlands, working initially at The Hague; by 1647 he was in Haarlem and the following year Amsterdam, where he married in 1649. In 1650 Frans returned to Antwerp, where he painted numerous monochrome landscapes in the manner of Jan van Goyen. Paintings such as the Valley with Mountains (c. 1640-50; Philadelphia, Museum of Art) prefigure the imaginative landscapes of Hercules Seghers. The impression of vast panoramic spaces in Frans's work is adopted from his uncle's art."
3434,"MOMPER, Jan de","(b. ca. 1617, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1688, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/momper/jan/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Little is known about this artist who in all likelihood belonged to the Flemish artist family, Momper.  Long forgotten, Jan de Momper was brought back from obscurity by R. Longhi, who tentatively compiled the artist's oeuvre and who named him ""Monsù X"". Later, the identification of an inscription on the reverse of a picture in the Chigi collection, Ariccia, lead to the identification of Monsù X as Jan de Momper."
3435,"MOMPER, Joos de","(b. 1564, Antwerpen, d. 1634/35, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/momper/josse2/biograph.html,"
Josse de Momper II was the leading member of an Antwerp family of artists and dealers. He was trained by his father, but he probably went to Italy in the 1580s, in which case he would have seen the Alps: he lived in Antwerp, but his works are invariably of great mountains, sometimes influenced by Bruegel, and they form a transition between Mannerist landscape and the realistic type developed in the Netherlands in the 17th century, e.g. by van Goyen. His pictures usually have blue mountains in the background, with a yellowish-green middle distance and a darker foreground peopled by small figures, often painted by Momper himself. Attribution is difficult because of the other members of the family who worked in a similar style. There are several works in Vaduz (Liechtenstein Collection) and four Seasons in Brunswick; others are in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Berlin, Manchester (Whitworth) and Oxford. 



"
3436,"MOMPER, Philips de, I","(b. 1598, Antwerpen, d. 1634, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/momper/philips/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of artists, son of Joos de Momper. He spent two years in Italy, travelling with Jan Brueghel the Younger, where, according to Arnold Houbraken, he had been an early member of the Schildersbent in Rome. Philips became a member of the Guild of St. Luke in Antwerp in 1624. "
3437,"MONALDI, Paolo",(active 1750-1800 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monaldi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, a pupil and minor follower of Andrea Locatelli. He painted mainly bambocciate, setting his low-life figures in an Arcadian atmosphere without, however, subordinating them to the landscape, as did Locatelli in the paintings for which he was best known. Monaldi's canvases depict scenes of simple country life (games, dances and drinking sessions) in settings that are characterized by ruined, thatched buildings. More realistic in approach is his signed and dated portrait of the Horse Aquilino (1752; Palazzo Braschi, Rome), painted for Prince Camillo Rospigliosi, who was passionately fond of horses and commissioned Monaldi and Giovanni Reder (b. 1639) to paint those in his stables."
3438,"MONET, Claude","(b. 1840, Paris, d. 1926, Giverny)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monet/biograph.html,"
French painter, founder and leader  of the Impressionist movement in France; indeed the movement's name, Impressionism, is derived from his Impression, Sunrise (1873; Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris). He adhered to its principles throughout his long career and is considered the most consistently representative painter of the school as well as one of the foremost painters of landscape in the history of art."
3439,"MONI, Louis de","(b. 1698, Breda, d. 1771, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moni/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was a pupil of Philip van Dijk (1680-1753) at the Hague. He studied the works of Gerard Dou, and imitated the manner of Frans van Mieris the Elder. He accompanied Philip van Dijk to Kassel, and afterwards settled at Leiden, where he died in 1771. His paintings consist of portraits and genre pieces of a simple and pleasing character, though cold in colouring.



"
3440,"MONNOT, Pierre Etienne","(b. 1657, Orchamps-Vennes, d. 1733, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monnot/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, active in Italy. His father, a wood-carver, moved with his family to Besançon when Monnot was still a child. Monnot was taught to carve by his father, and at the age of 19 he moved to Dijon, where he was apprenticed to the sculptor Jean Dubois. Although he spent the years 1677-87 in Paris, his professional career was passed almost entirely outside France. His earliest dated work is a group of five small marble reliefs (1688) for the Hôtel de Ville at Poligny, Jura (in situ)."
3441,"MONNOYER, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1636, Lille, d. 1699, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monnoyer/biograph.html,"
Franco-Flemish flower-painter who was trained in Antwerp, but became a member of the Academy in Paris in 1665 and worked for Louis XIV. It is said that he was annoyed because his son Antoine, an inferior flower-painter, was allowed to alter some of his works, and in a fit of pique he went to London c. 1685. There he worked for the Duke of Montagu's new (and very French) town house (many of these pictures have passed by inheritance to the Duke of Buccleuch) and he remained in London until his death. His flower-pieces are rich and splendid, yet painted with the greatest regard for botanical accuracy: they frequently appear in English sale-rooms under his nickname 'Baptiste'. He also published books of engravings of flowers."
3442,"MONSIAU, Nicolas-André","(b. 1754, Paris, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monsiau/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a student of Jean-François-Pierre Peyron in Paris and, thanks to a sponsor, the Marquis de Couberon, followed his master to Rome in 1776. He stayed four years and made the acquaintance of Jacques-Louis David and Pierre Henri de Valenciennes."
3443,"MONT, Deodat van der","(b. 1582, Antwerpen, d. 1644, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mont/biograph.html,"
Deodat van der Mont (or Deodat Delmont, in Italian Deodati del Monte), Flemish painter. He is primarily important as the earliest known pupil and assistant of Peter Paul Rubens. From a certificate drawn up for him by Rubens in 1628, it is known that in 1600 he travelled to Italy in Rubens's service. Other documents confirm this: in 1608, for example, van der Mont witnessed Rubens's contract with the Oratorians for the execution of a 'Nativity', intended for the high altar of San Filippo Neri in Fermo. In October 1608 he returned to Antwerp with Rubens. Immediately after this he enrolled as a member of the Guild of St Luke. He started working as a painter and is recorded as having a workshop with two pupils in 1610."
3444,"MONT, Hans","(b. ca. 1540, Gent, d. after 1585)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mont_h/biograph.html,"
Hans Mont (also Johann de Monte), Flemish sculptor and architect. He worked in an Italian Mannerist style in Italy, Austria, Bohemia, and Germany. In 1572 he collaborated with the internationally renowned artist Giambologna in Italy. Three years later he had returned to the north, where he worked as a court artist to Emperor Maximilian II in Vienna. There he created giant stucco figures as well as wall and ceiling decorations. Mont also designed a large triumphal arch for Emperor Rudolf II's ceremonial entry into Vienna in 1576."
3445,"MONTAGNA, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1450, Orzinuovi, Brescia, d. 1523, Vicenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montagna/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo Montagna (actually Bartolomeo Cincani), Italian painter from the Brescia region. His initial training was presumably under Domenico Morone in Verona. He had a distinct Venetian influence, probably in Giovanni Bellini's studio. He may also have adopted the Mantegnesque severity. His occasional obsession with detail is reminiscent of Carpaccio. He was active in Venice (Scuola di San Marco) and in Verona, mainly however in Vicenza. Powerful use of colour (zinc plating), symmetrical picture composition, and marked light-dark contrasts are his distinguishing characteristics. The Friulian School (Pellegrino and Pordenone) is indebted to him. Benedetto Montagna, a productive engraver, was his son and pupil.



"
3446,"MONTAÑEZ, Juan Martinez","(b. 1568, Alcala la Real, d. 1649, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montanez/biograph.html,"
The greatest Spanish sculptor of the 17th century, known as 'el dios de la madera' (the god of wood) on account of his mastery as a carver. He worked for most of his long and productive career in Seville (Pacheco often painted his figures), his most famous work being the Christ of Clemency (1603-06) in the cathedral there, which shows the new naturalism he brought to the polychromed wooden statue. In this he occupied a role comparable to Gregorio Fernández in Valladolid, but Montáñez was more aristocratic in style, tempering Baroque emotionalism with a classical sense of dignity."
3447,"MONTAUTI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1685, Firenze, d. after 1740, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montauti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, medallist and possible architect. A pupil in Florence of Giuseppe Piamontini, he was first active as a medallist; one of his earliest and most exquisite medals celebrated the visit of King Frederick IV of Denmark and Norway to Florence in 1708. On the obverse is a portrait of the King; on the reverse, a view of the city with a reclining river god personifying the Arno (Bargello, Florence). A medal of Conte Lorenzo Magalotti, dated 1712 (British Museum, London), has Apollo on the reverse, whose exaggerated sway in the hips is reflected in two later small bronzes (Rome, Palazzo  Corsini). There are also two medals of the Grand Duke Gian Gastone de' Medici (before 1723 and 1731, both Bargello, Florence). Montauti's careful characterizations in the portrait medals are reflected in his marble portrait busts. One, of Gian Gastone de' Medici (c. 1724; S. Maria Nuova, Florence), emphasizes the ugly features of large nose, pouting lips and jutting chin by using a schematic treatment for the wig.



"
3448,"MONTELUPO, Baccio da","(b. 1469, Montelupo, d. 1535, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montelup/baccio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, father of Raffaello da Montelupo. In his Lives, Giorgio Vasari dedicates chapters to this sculptor and calls him ""a rare and excellent master"". While we know little of his early career, Vasari further notes that Baccio worked with Michelangelo at Lorenzo de' Medici's Giardino di San Marco in Florence."
3449,"MONTELUPO, Raffaello da","(b. 1504, Firenze, d. 1566, Orvieto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montelup/raffaell/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of an Italian family of sculptors and architects active in central and northern Italy from the end of the 15th century to the mid-16th. He was the son of Baccio da Montelupo. Trained by his father and the goldsmith Michelangelo Viviani in Florence, he worked briefly in Carrara in 1521 and entered the workshop of Lorenzo Lotto in Rome in 1523. There he assisted on projects including the tomb of the poet Bernardino Capella (c. 1460–1524) in S Stefano Rotondo, the tomb of Raphael (Pantheon) and in the Cappella Chigi (S Maria del Popolo). It was probably through the circle of Raphael that he met influential supporters, such as Baldassare Turini and Antonio da Sangallo. He also made drawings after the Antique during this formative period, which ended in 1527 with the Sack of Rome."
3450,"MONTFAUCON, Bernard de","(b. 1655, Soulage, d. 1741, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montfauc/biograph.html,"
French scholar and critic. Belonging to a noble and ancient line, and destined for the army, he passed most of his time in the library of the family castle of Roquetaillade, devouring books in different languages and on almost every variety of subject. In 1672 he entered the army, and in the two following years served in Germany under Turenne. But ill-health and the death of his parents brought him back to his studious life, and in 1675 he entered the cloister of the Congregation of St Maur at La Daurade, Toulouse, taking the vows there on the 13th of May 1676. He lived successively at various abbeys - at Soreze, where he specially studied Greek and examined the numerous manusripts of the convent library, at La Grasse, and at Bordeaux; and in 1687 he was called to Paris, to collaborate in an edition of Athanasius and Chrysostom, contemplated by the Congregation."
3451,"MONTFORT, Octavianus",(documented 1646-1696 in Turin),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montfort/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is known for producing refined still-lifes painted in tempera on parchment. There are only two still-lifes by him dated 1680 and 1689, respectively (both in private collection), therefore the chronological order of his paintings cannot be determined. However, it is established that he followed the examples of Giovanna Garzoni who was active in Turin in the 1630s.



"
3452,"MONTI, Francesco","(b. 1646, Brescia, d. 1703, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Brescianino delle Battaglie. He is one of the three painters with the nickname ""Brescianino,"" and not to be confused with another Francesco Monti (1685-1768), a Bolognese painter of religious subjects. His first teacher was Pietro Ricchi (called il Lucchese) in Venice, then in Rome he studied with Jacques Courtois, a prolific painter of battle scenes."
3453,"MONTICELLI, Adolphe","(b. 1824, Marseille, d. 1886, Marseille)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monticel/biograph.html,"
Adolphe-Joseph-Thomas Monticelli, French painter. In 1846, after studying at the Ecole d'Art in Marseille, he left Provence to study in Paris with Paul Delaroche. Although he had been trained to work in a Neo-classical style by his teachers in Marseille, in Paris he admired the Troubadour pictures of such artists as Pierre Révoil and Fleury Richard and the bold colours and rich surface impasto of Delacroix's oil sketches. He also copied many of the Old Masters in the Louvre."
3454,"MONTORFANO, Giovanni Donato da","(b. ca. 1460, Milano, d. ca. 1503, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montorfa/biograph.html,"

3455,"MONTORSOLI, Giovanni Angelo","(b. 1507, Montorsoli, d. 1563, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montorso/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. After a three-year apprenticeship with Andrea di Piero Ferrucci, he worked as an assistant in Rome (producing rosettes on the cornices of St Peter's), Perugia and Volterra. He then went to Florence to work on the New Sacristy (Medici Chapel) and the Biblioteca Laurenziana at San Lorenzo, probably from 1524; the influence of Michelangelo was to prove decisive. Work at San Lorenzo was suspended as a result of the expulsion of the Medici in 1527, and Montorsoli decided to enter a religious order; he was inducted into the Servite Order at Santissima Annunziata in 1530, taking his vows in 1531. For his monastery church he restored the wax portraits of the Medici family, which had been destroyed in 1527, and modelled new ones of Leo X, Clement VII, Matthias Corvinus and Giacomo V d'Appiano, Duke of Piombino (untraced)."
3456,"MONTOYER, Louis Joseph","(b. 1749, Mariemont, d. 1811, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/montoyer/biograph.html,"
Flemish architect. He worked in Brussels as an architect and building contractor from 1778 onwards. Although he has been credited as the architect of the Royal Palace of Laeken, later research made clear he was merely executing the designs of other architects such as Charles de Wailly. In Brussels he built the Théâtre Royal du Parc (the Parktheater) in 1782. "
3457,"MONVOISIN, Raymond Auguste Quinsac","(b. 1790, Quinsac, d. 1870, Boulogne-sur-Seine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/monvoisi/biograph.html,"
Raymond Monvoisin (also called Quinsac-Monvoisin), French painter and portraitist. He was a student of Pierre Lacour (1745-1814) in Bordeaux, and of Pierre-Narcisse Guérin in Paris. Between 1821 and 1825 he stayed in Rome as the winner of the Academy of France in Rome."
3458,"MOOR, Carel de II","(b. 1656, Leiden, d. 1738, Warmond)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moor/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher, son of Carel de Moor I (1627-1689), a painter and art dealer. Little known today, even in his native country, yet during his lifetime he was considered one of the greatest Dutch painters. Born in Leiden, he was sent to study drawing with Dou and thereafter, in early 1672, to the atelier of the Amsterdam portraitist Abraham van den Tempel. After van den Tempel's death, the fledgling artist returned to Leiden to study with Frans van Mieris and then, finally, traveled to Dordrecht for further instruction with Godfried Schalcken."

Austrian architect, born as Andreas Moosbrugger. Trained as a stone mason, his skill led to his involvement in the renovations on the Benedictine monastery at Einsiedeln. In 1682, Moosbrugger entered the Einsiedeln as Brother Caspar. His training as an architect took place during this same period."
3460,"MOR VAN DASHORST, Anthonis","(b. 1516/19, Utrecht, d. 1576/77, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mor/biograph.html,"
Anthonis Mor van Dashorst, also called Antonio Moro, Netherlandish portrait painter, a pupil of Jan van Scorel in his native Utrecht. He was the most successful court portraitist of his day, leading an international career that took him to England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In England he painted a portrait of Mary Tudor (Prado, Madrid, 1554, and other versions), for which he is said to have been knighted - he is sometimes known as Sir Anthony More and the Spanish version of his name, Antonio Moro, is also commonly used."
3461,"MORA, Bernardo de","(b. 1614, Porreras, Mallorca, d. 1684, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mora/bernardo/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He probably began his training in Baza (Granada) in the workshop of Cecilio López Criado, with whom he collaborated until he moved to Granada in 1650 to begin working with Pedro de Mena and to direct his workshop. When Alonso Cano arrived in Granada in 1652, both Mora and Mena became influenced by his work. Mora's earliest surviving sculpture is the Ecce homo (1659; Granada, Capilla Real), a half-length figure in polychromed wood of a type commonly used by Mena, to whom the piece has been attributed. Mora's work is not documented again until 1665, when he collaborated with his son José de Mora in the execution of the grey marble sculptures on the façade of the Basilica de Nuestra Señora de las Angustias, Granada."
3462,"MORA, José de","(b. 1642, Baza, Granada, d. 1724, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mora/jose/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor, the son of the sculptor Bernardo de Mora and pupil of Alonso Cano. His important works are the eight statues in the Capella del Cardenal. in the Mosque-Cathedral at Cordova, and the figures of St Bruno and St Joseph in the Charterhouse near Granada."
3463,"MORA, Juan Gómez de","(b. 1586, Madrid, d. 1648, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mora_j/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. He was the son of Juan Gómez (ca. 1555-1597), court painter to Philip II of Spain, and cousin of the architect Francisco de Mora (c.1553-1610), considered one of the best representatives of Herreran architecture. His major works were, among others, the Convent of San Gil (from 1613), Plaza Mayor and its surroundings (1617-1619), City Council building (until 1644) in Madrid; Cathedral of the Madeleine in Getafe; and Monasterio de San Bernardo in Alcalá de Henares.



"
3464,"MORALES, Luis de","(b. ca. 1520, Badajoz, d. 1586, Badajoz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morales/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He worked for most of his life in Badajoz, a town on the Portuguese border, and his style-formed away from the influence of the court or great religious and artistic centres such as Seville - is highly distinctive. His pictures are usually fairly small and he concentrated on devotional images. He painted numerous versions of the Virgin and Child, sometimes with the infant St John, and touching visions inspired by the theme Ecce Homo, which are among his most popular works. The piety of his work has earned him the nickname 'El Divino'. His style owes something to Netherlandish art, but his misty modelling seems to derive more from Leonardo da Vinci.


"
3465,"MORANDO, Bernardo","(b. ca. 1540, Padova, d. ca. 1601, Zamosc)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morando/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Poland. He is notable as the designer of the new town of Zamosc, modelled on Renaissance theories of the 'ideal city'."
3466,"MORATTI, Francesco","(d. ca. 1719, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moratti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, named also il Padovano, he was born in Padua and died in Rome in circa 1719. He was a pupil of Filippo Parodi, who in his turn was a pupil of Gianlorenzo Bernini in Rome. Together with Parodi, Moratti collaborated over the tomb of Orazio Secco (Basilica del Santo, Padua). Successively he worked in Rome for the churches Chiesa del Gesù, S.Maria degli Angeli, S.Agostino and St John Lateran where sculptured a colossal statue of Apostle Simon. Another famous work of Moratti is the execution of the fountain in Piazza della Bocca della Verità in Rome.



"
3467,MORAZZONE,"(b. 1573, Morazzone, d. 1626, Piedmont)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morazzon/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Pier Francesco Mazzuchelli. Together with Giovanni Battista Crespi and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, he was the leading Milanese painter of the early 17th century. Like Crespi, he was in Rome in the 1590s, where frescoes by him survive in S. Silvestro in Capite. Even more than Crespi and Procaccini, however, he based his art on Gaudenzio Ferrari, and his principal works are also for chapels on the Sacro Monti at Varallo, Varese and Novara. At the time of his death he was painting frescoes in Piacenza Cathedral, completed by Guercino. There are many works by him in museums and churches in Milan.



"
3468,"MORBELLI, Angelo","(b. 1853, Alessandria, d. 1919, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morbelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He received his first lessons in drawing in Alessandria, and in 1867 he travelled on a local study grant to Milan, where he was based for the rest of his life. He enrolled at the Accademia di Brera and from 1867 to 1876 studied drawing and painting there under Raffaele Casnedi (1822-1892) and Giuseppe Bertini (1825-1898), whose influence is seen in both the subject-matter and technique of his early works. These include perspectival views, anecdotal genre scenes and history paintings. In the Dying Goethe (1880; Alessandria, Pinacoteca Civica) the theatrical setting, enriched by a sophisticated execution and a well-modulated use of colour, derives from the teaching of Casnedi and Bertini, while the historic-romantic quality of this painting also recalls the style of Francesco Hayez."
3469,"MORE, Jacob","(b. 1740, Edinburgh, d. 1793, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/more/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, active in Italy. The son of an Edinburgh merchant, he was first apprenticed to a goldsmith and then, from 1766, to the Norie family of house-painters. In the 1760s he produced numerous sketches of the Scottish Lowlands (examples National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), and in 1769 he designed and executed stage sets at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, for the first productions after the legalizing of the theatre in Scotland."

Draughtsman, engraver and painter, part of a French family of artists. The brothers Louis-Gabriel (1740-1805) and Jean-Michel Moreau (1741-1814) were the sons of a Paris wigmaker. They both worked in the same media but achieved success in different fields, Louis-Gabriel working principally as an innovative landscape painter and Jean-Michel as a book illustrator and a recorder of contemporary manners and events. Horace Vernet was Jean-Michel's grandson, from the marriage of his daughter to Carle Vernet."
3471,"MOREAU, Louis-Gabriel","(b. 1740, Paris, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau/louis-g/biograph.html,"
French painter and engraver. His father was a wigmaker who later went into the pottery business. He apprenticed his son to the architectural painter Pierre de Marchy. Louis, later to be known as Moreau the Elder to distinguish him from his brother Jean-Michel, absorbed at de Marchy's studio his master's classical taste for formal landscapes with fine monuments. Yet de Marchy also painted views of Paris and its vicinity, subjects that greatly appealed to his pupil. But he was not content with his forerunner's technique, his eye for nature was truer: Moreau would do full justice to the meadows, the greeneries and the grey skies of his homeland."
3472,"MOREAU, Adrien","(b. 1843, Troyes, d. 1906, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau_a/biograph.html,"
French painter and illustrator. A pupil of Léon Cogniet and Isidore Pils at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Moreau exhibited at the Paris Salon for the first time in 1868. He was awarded a second-class medal at the Salon of 1876, silver in 1899 and at the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and was made Chévalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1892."
3473,"MOREAU, Gustave","(b. 1826, Paris, d. 1898, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau_g/biograph.html,"
French painter, whose main focus was the illustration of biblical and mythological figures. As a painter of literary ideas rather than visual images, he appealed to the imaginations of some Symbolist writers and artists, who saw him as a precursor to their movement."
3474,"MOREAU, Hippolyte François","(b. 1832, Dijon, d. 1927, Neuilly-sur-Seine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau_m/hyppolit/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, son of the renowned sculptor Jean-Baptiste Moreau. He first began working in his father's workshop. After his work experience at the family atelier, Hippolyte François, along with his two brothers, Auguste and Mathurin, went to complete his studies in Paris under the tutorship of François Jouffroy (1806-1882). Moreau exhibited his oeuvre for the first time at the Salon in 1859 and he frequently exhibited his work at the Salon des Artistes Français from 1889 until 1917. He obtained an honourable mention in 1888 as well as a third class medal in 1889."
3475,"MOREAU, Mathurin","(b. 1822, Dijon, d. 1912, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau_m/mathurin/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He came from a distinguished family of artists, studying initially under his father, Jean Baptiste Moreau, before he enrolled at the École des Beaux Arts in 1841, where he was a pupil of Ramey and Dumont."
3476,"MOREAU, Robert",(active 1532-1540 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreau_r/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor of French origin. He became a citizen of Antwerp in 1532-33 and in 1533 entered the Guild of St Luke, to which wood-carvers belonged. Evidently he also worked in stone, for on 2 July 1536 he received a contract from the emissary of the Bishop of Dunkeld, Scotland, to supply six pieces of black polished marble to frame the Bishop's copper tomb plaque (destroyed). On 17 June 1537 he received a prestigious commission from the wealthy abbey of Gembloux to produce a large carved wooden altarpiece (destroyed) with ten scenes from the Lives of Sts Peter and Paul and including a donor portrait of the abbot, Antoine Papin (d. 1541), all to be carved within two years for a fee of 800 gold florins."
3477,"MOREELSE, Paulus","(b. 1571, Utrecht, d. 1638, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moreelse/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and architect, active in Utrecht, where he helped found the St Lucas guild in 1611. He is best known for his portraits, which are similar to those made by his teacher Miereveld, but less severe. His portraits of shepherds and blonde shepherdesses with a deep decolletage were popular during his lifetime. He designed the Catherine Gate (destroyed) and possibly the façade of the Meat Market in Utrecht.



"
3478,"MOREL, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1662, Antwerpen, d. 1732, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morel/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He studied c. 1674 under the Antwerp still-life painter Nicolaes van Verendael (1640-1691) who specialized in flower pieces and garlands. He was successful as a painter in Antwerp but moved to Brussels after 1695 to respond to the significant demand for his work there. He became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1699. He obtained commissions from the governor of the Southern Netherlands whose palaces in Brussels he decorated."
3479,"MORELLI, Domenico","(b. 1823, Napoli, d. 1901, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and teacher. Unique among his Italian colleagues in enjoying an international reputation in his lifetime, he was, with Filippo Palizzi, the leading exponent of the Neapolitan school of painting in the second half of the 19th century and a major figure in the artistic and cultural life of Italy. He studied at the Academy of Arts in Naples."
3480,"MORET, Henry","(b. 1856, Cherbourg, d. 1913, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moret/biograph.html,"
French marine and landscape painter who spent most of his life in Brittany. He preferred to paint coastal scenes capturing the power and violence of the sea against the granite outcrops of the Brittany coast, but also painted rural scenes of landscapes and working people."
3481,"MORETTI, Scipione","(b. 1825, Roma, d. 1893, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moretti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. The son of an architect, he began his training in 1843 as an assistant in the studios of Pietro Tenerani and Randolph Rogers, two of the most distinguished Neoclassical sculptors active in Rome. In 1864 Moretti moved on to the workshop of Giuseppe Obici, with whom he collaborated in the execution of the statues for the Column of the Immaculate Conception near the Spanish steps. In 1883, the same year that he participated in a contest for the monument to Raphael in Urbino, Moretti exhibited Il cacciatore africano (The African Hunter) at the International Exhibition in Rome to critical acclaim. The sculptor subsequently left Rome to work in San Sebastian, Spain, returning to Italy in 1890."
3482,MORETTO da Brescia,"(b. ca. 1498, Brescia, d. 1554, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moretto/biograph.html,"Moretto da Brescia (originally Alessandro Bonvicino), Italian painter, active mainly in his native Brescia and the neighbourhood. He was a pupil of Titian and certainly his influence is apparent in Moretto's work. He was the leading Brescian painter of his day and had a large practice as a painter of altarpieces and other religious works, the best of which display an impressive gravity and a poetic feeling for nature (St Giustina with a Donor). However, his portraits, although much less numerous, are considered to be generally of higher quality and of greater importance historically. It seems likely that he introduced the independent full-length portrait to Italy, for although Vasari credits Titian with this distinction. Moretto's Portrait of a Gentleman of 1526 in the National Gallery, London, antedates any known example by Titian by several years. He passed on the thoughtful qualities to his pupil Moroni.


"
3483,"MORIN, Jean","(b. ca. 1590, Paris, d. 1650, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morin/biograph.html,"
French engraver. Very little is known of his life beyond what may be learnt from his prints. His work consists mainly of reproductive portraits after Philippe de Champaigne and van Dyck, and landscapes after Jacques Fouquier. He is said to have started his career as a painter, but no painting by him is known. Six of his landscape prints are his own compositions."
3484,"MORIN, Jean-Louis","(b. 1732 Vincennes, d. 1787, Sèvres)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morin_j/biograph.html,"
French porcelain painter. When Jean-Louis Morin started work at age twenty-one at the Vincennes Porcelain Manufactory, he was described as ""five foot four inches high, with red hair, shifty eyes and nearly white [skin]...and freckles, wearing a wig, with an ugly body."" The son of an army surgeon, Morin studied surgery before changing his profession to porcelain painter. According to the factory's enrolment register, he started with an adequate knowledge of drawing but had little talent for the more difficult task of applying colours. After a couple of years of practice, however, he was ""making progress with his use of colours"" and ""his talents and work [had] improved."""
3485,"MORISOT, Berthe","(b. 1841, Bourges, d. 1895, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morisot/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. As the child of upper middle-class parents, she was expected to be a skilled amateur artist and was thus given appropriate schooling. In 1857 she attended drawing lessons with Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne (active 1838-1857), but in 1858 she and her sister Edma left to study under Joseph-Benoit Guichard, a pupil of Ingres and Delacroix. In the same year they registered as copyists in the Louvre, copying Veronese and Rubens. The sisters were introduced to Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot in 1861 and took advice from him and subsequently from his pupil, Achille-François Oudinot (1820-1891). Through these artists they became familiar with current debates on naturalism and began to work en plein air, painting at Pontoise, Normandy and Brittany."
3486,"MORLAITER, Giovan Maria","(b. 1699, Venezia, d. 1781, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morlaite/giovan/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His father, Gregorio, was a glassworker from the Alto Adige. Morlaiter's training as a sculptor may have taken place in Venice, and certainly his style has much in common with that of Venetian sculptors such as Filippo Parodi, Giuseppe Torretti and Francesco Cabianca; it also, however, has markedly Rococo characteristics that would have been more readily assimilated by an artist from outside the Venetian mainstream tradition."
3487,"MORLAITER, Michelangelo","(b. 1729, Venezia, d. 1806, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morlaite/michelan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice, son of the sculptor Giovanni Maria Morlaiter. He studied with Jacopo Amigoni and worked in the manner of Tiepolo, Piazzetta and Sebastiano Ricci. He was a founding member of Venice's Accademia di Belle Arti, along with Francesco Maggiotto and Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo."
3488,"MORLAND, George","(b. 1763, London, d. 1804, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morland/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was an exponent of picturesque rustic genre painting who based himself on Dutch and Flemish 17-century models such as Brouwer or Teniers. Like them, he refused to work for individual patrons and preferred to sell through an agent, thus altering the whole basis of patronage in 18th-century England. His very numerous works were popularized through engravings, many of which were executed by William Ward, brother of James Ward, Morland's own brother-in-law, and imitator."
3489,"MORO, Giuseppe del","(b. 1718, Firenze, d. 1781, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of the quadratura painter Lorenzo del Moro. He was a pupil of his father and in 1740 he joined the Accademia del Disegno in Florence where he held various positions in the years 1778-81."
3490,"MORO, Lorenzo del","(b. 1677, Firenze, d. 1735, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moro1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a quadratura painter active in Tuscany. He painted decorations for the church of Ognissanti in Florence, the Villa del Poggio Imperiale, San Domenico di Fiesole, for the Palazzo Cellesi in Pistoia, etc.. He made also cartoons for tapestries.



"
3491,"MORONE, Domenico","(b. ca. 1442, Verona, d. ca. 1518, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morone/domenico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of the Veronese school. Vasari - exceptionally well informed on Veronese artists - asserted that Domenico was taught by students of the Gothic painter Stefano da Verona. His earliest signed work, a fine Virgin and Child dated 29 April 1483 (Berlin, Staatliche Museen), reveals his conversion to Andrea Mantegna's ideas, partly as filtered through Giovanni Bellini and Francesco Benaglio. His next, the signed and dated Expulsion of the Bonacolsi from Mantua (1494; Mantua, Palazzo Ducale), parallels the Venetian panoramic narratives of Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio and may owe much to Giovanni Bellini's lost battle paintings for the Doge's Palace in Venice. Though damaged and repainted (the distant landscape, for example, is new), this spirited narrative remains valuable both for its detailed description of 15th-century Mantua and as the most convincing large-scale Quattrocento battle-piece that survives."
3492,"MORONE, Francesco","(b. ca. 1471, Verona, d. 1529, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morone/francesc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son and pupil of Domenico Morone and an associate and friend of Gerolamo dai Libri (c. 1474-1555). He was one of the leading painters in Verona in the early 16th century. Vasari praised his frescoes (1505-07) for the cupola of the sacristy in Santa Maria in Organo, Verona. He also painted the organ shutters in that church."
3493,"MORONI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1525, Albino, d. 1578, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moroni/biograph.html,"Italian painter, son of an architect, Andrea Moroni. Moroni was one of the greatest, albeit the shyest, portrait painters of the sixteenth century. He trained under Moretto in Brescia and worked mainly in his home town of Albino and in nearby Bergamo. His style was based closely on that of his master, but whereas his religious and allegorical paintings are generally heavy-handed, his portraits are worthy successors to Moretto's. They are remarkable for their psychological penetration, dignified air, and exquisite silvery tonality. The National Gallery, London, has the best collection of his work, including the celebrated portrait known as The Taylor.
"
3494,"MORRICE, James Wilson","(b. 1865, Montréal, d. 1924, Tunis)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morrice/biograph.html,"
Canadian painter. From a wealthy Montreal family, he trained as a lawyer but went to Paris in late 1889 to devote himself entirely to painting. He was the first Canadian painter to win an international reputation."
3495,"MORRIS, William","(b. 1834, Walthamstow, d. 1896, Hammersmith)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/morris/biograph.html,"
English designer, writer and activist. His importance as both a designer and propagandist for the arts cannot easily be overestimated, and his influence has continued to be felt throughout the 20th century. He was a committed Socialist whose aim was that, as in the Middle Ages, art should be for the people and by the people, a view expressed in several of his writings."
3496,"MOSCA, Francesco","(b. ca. 1546, d. 1578, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mosca/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of artists, the son of the sculptor Simone Mosca. He also worked in Orvieto, and he may have completed his father's unfinished commissions. For the cathedral there he executed a nude statue of St Sebastian and figures of St Peter and St Paul. He also executed statues for Pisa Cathedral (a Virgin and Child and Angel in the chapel of the Annunciation) and in 1577 travelled to Parma, where he was employed briefly by the Farnese as court sculptor. A marble relief of Diana and Acteon (Florence, Bargello) and a free-standing group of Atalanta and Meleager (Kansas City, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art) reflect Francesco's indebtedness to mid-16th-century Mannerism.


"
3497,"MOSER, Lukas","(b. ca. 1390, Weil der Stadt, d. after 1434)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moser/biograph.html,"

German painter. He was born in Weil der Stadt near Stuttgart, but probably worked mostly in Ulm, where he also produced designs for stained glass. His name is known only through an inscription on the frame of the altarpiece above the altar of St Mary Magdalene in the parish church at Tiefenbronn, near Pforzheim. Moser was certainly familiar with northern Italian art, and perhaps also with earlier Tuscan painting. He probably visited Provence and southern France, and also had first-hand knowledge of Franco-Flemish innovations.

"
3498,"MOSKOS, Elias","(d. 1687, Zakynthos)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/moskos/biograph.html," Elias Moskos originated from Rethymnon on Crete, and was one of the five most important Greek icon-painters of the 17th century. The battle for Crete between 1645 and 1669 and the final fall of the capital Candia (today's Herakleion) to the Turks forced many important painters into exile on the Ionian islands of Zakynthos, Corfu or Kefalonia. In 1646 Elias Moskos was one of those to settle on Zakynthos, where he lived and worked until his death on 26 January 1687. All his dated icons were painted either on Zakynthos or the neighbouring island of Kefalonia between 1649 and 1686.

French painter. He was a student at the Académie de St Luc, Paris, where he trained as a miniature painter. In 1776 he was appointed Peintre de la Reine to Marie-Antoinette. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1786 and received (reçu) as a full member in 1788, presenting two portraits of Academicians, the sculptor Charles-Antoine Bridan (Paris, Ecole Normale Supérieur des Beaux-Arts) and the painter Louis Lagrenée I (Versailles, Château). He exhibited a Self-portrait (St. Petersburg, Hermitage) at the Salon of 1786, showing himself relaxed and confident at the centre of his studio, flanked by two canvases, which are being admired by his two daughters."

In 1563 he married Margareta Baes in St Walburgakerk, and between 1564 and 1572 six children were christened in the same church. From 1575 onwards, and until 1588 (the registers are missing between 1579 and 1584), several more were christened in the St Joriskerk. A tax list of 1584 indicates that the painter was then living in a rented house near that church."
3501,"MOSTAERT, Jan","(b. ca. 1475, Haarlem, d. 1555/56, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mostaert/jan/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. He was born in Haarlem and the influence of Geertgen tot Sint Jans can be clearly seen in his rather stiff and gangling figures. As painter to Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Netherlands, he accompanied her on her travels, making portraits of her courtiers. He also painted religious works. His most remarkable painting, however, is a landscape of the West Indies (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, 1525-30). Many of his paintings were destroyed in the Great Fire of Haarlem in 1576, and little is known in detail of his career.

He also reproduced in mezzotint Thomas Jones Barker's Morning before the Battle and Evening after the Battle published in 1865 and 1866. His most celebrated works however are the three mixed mezzotints plates reproducing John Martin's Latest Judgement (1853), Plains of Heaven (1851-53) and Great Day of His Wrath (1851-53) all in London at the Tate Gallery.

Painter, part of a Dutch family of artists of French descent. Both Frederik de Moucheron and his son Isaac de Moucheron specialized in Italianate landscape views with park-like settings. These were particularly used to decorate the walls in houses of the well-to-do in Amsterdam."
3504,"MOUCHERON, Isaac de","(b. 1667, Amsterdam, d. 1744, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mouchero/isaac/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman, etcher and architect, He was one of eleven children of the landscape painter Frederick de Moucheron and Maria Magdalena de Jouderville, the daughter of the Rembrandt pupil Isaac de Jouderville, for whom he was named. He was apprenticed to his father, before going to Italy, where he arrived c. 1695 and stayed for at least two years. He worked mainly in Rome in company with other northern artists, who gave him the Bent-name 'Ordonantie'."

3506,"MULIER, Pieter the Elder","(b. ca. 1610, Haarlem, d. 1670, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mulier/elder/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter. He trained under Simon de Vlieger in Rotterdam and worked under the influence of Jan Porcellis. He entered the Guild of St Luke in Haarlem in 1638. In 1647 he is recorded in Amsterdam. A later record confirms a delivery of beer to his Haarlem address in exchange for paintings. He painted seascapes with shipping on choppy waters under a vast, misty sky (Bredius Museum, The Hague). This type of painting must have proved popular with his clients for he resorted to the same composition over and over again. He typically used dark waves in the foreground to push the scene back and enhance the sense of depth; a tilted sailing vessel to close the composition from the left; and a small fishing boat with a figure of the fisherman hauling a net as a central feature of almost all paintings. He signed his works but did not date them and this makes their chronology difficult to establish."
3507,"MULIER, Pieter the Younger","(b. 1637, Haarlem, d. 1701, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mulier/younger/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter, nicknamed Il Cavalier Tempesta or Pietro Tempesta. He was the son of Pieter Mulier the Elder (c. 1615-70), a marine painter who trained under Simon de Vlieger. Pieter the Younger lived in Italy from 1684 until his death. He spent 16 years in jail accused of a murder. He has applied the knowledge and experience gained there to create a realistic depiction of weather conditions and its effects on shipping, together with a detailed account of shipping in a Mediterranean setting.

The family business, called De Vergulde Passer ('The gilded compasses'), was situated in Warmoesstraat, and Jan Muller worked there for many years. He may have been apprenticed to Hendrik Goltzius in Haarlem. Between 1594 and 1602 he is thought to have gone to Italy, where he stayed in Rome and Naples. He was related by marriage to the Dutch sculptor Adriaen de Vries, who was a pupil of Giambologna. He also maintained contacts with Bartholomeus Spranger and other artists in Prague, which under the rule of Emperor Rudolf II had become a flourishing centre of the arts. In 1602 he made an unsuccessful attempt to mediate on behalf of Rudolf II, who wanted to buy Lucas van Leyden's Last Judgement (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal, Leiden)."

In 1842-43 he travelled to Italy, staying mainly in Florence. In 1844-45 he opposed the rebuilding of the Laurenzenkirche at St Gall, which was instead restored (1849-55), basically in accordance with his ideas. Before going to Vienna in 1847, he designed several private houses and some railway stations, including that at Zurich."

3511,"MULREADY, William","(b. 1786, Ennis, d. 1863, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mulready/biograph.html,"
Irish-born painter, who went to England as a child and entered the Royal Academy Schools at 14. He was the pupil and brother-in-law of John Varley. He became a highly successful Victorian genre painter, influenced - as was Wilkie - by Dutch 17th-century genre. His technique of painting in thin layers on a white ground links him tenuously with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but his pretty and undemandingly trivial subject matter, his use of a middle tone, and traditional 18th-century systems of composition, later incurred their particular displeasure and rejection. He became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1815, and, following the success of his The Fight Interrupted in 1816, a Royal Academician. He designed the first penny post envelope issued by Rowland Hill in 1840.

3512,"MULTSCHER, Hans","(b. ca. 1400, Reichenhofen/Allgau, d. 1467, Ulm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/multsche/biograph.html,"
Multscher was a German sculptor active in Ulm. The solid naturalism of his style, reminiscent of Sluter, suggest that he was trained in the Netherlands or northern France. He ran a large workshop, which was influential in spreading this manner in Swabia. Paintings were integral to his altarpieces, but it is a matter for debate whether he practised painting himself. The Wurzach altar (1437), the only painting attributed to him by some experts, exhibits a realism nearer to contemporary Flemish than German painting."

He then moved to Florence, where for about a decade he was attached to the court of Ferdinand de' Medici. He also worked for Cosimo III and Cardinal Francesco Maria de' Medici (1667-1710), for whom he painted, among many other similar works, the Still-Life with Musical Instruments. His still-life paintings recall those of Evaristo Baschenis. He painted also panoplies and war trophies. In 1715 he moved to Pisa where he worked almost exclusively in art restoration. He died in Pisa in 1720 and he was buried in the Camposanto."

3516,"MUR, Ramon de",(active 1412-1435 in Tarragona),https://www.wga.hu/bio/m/mur/biograph.html,"
Catalan painter. He was active in the provinces of Tarragona and Lleida (Sp. Lérida). When living at Tarrega, near Cervera (Lleida), he signed a receipt for a retable of St Lucy that he had painted for S Coloma, Queralt (29 Oct 1412), and contracted to execute a retable of St Peter for a stonecutter, Pedro Ferrarons, for S Joan, Vinaixa (29 Oct 1420). In 1432, while living in Montblanc, he was commissioned to paint a retable of SS John the Baptist and John the Evangelist for the high altar of the same church in Vinaixa; this was completed in 1435. In the contract for an altarpiece of St Michael for the church of Guardia Lada, near Tarrega (15 June 1421), he is recorded as having already executed another St Michael for a donor at nearby Verdú (Lleida). Of these documented works, only the central panel of the altarpiece from Vinaixa survives (1432-35; Tarragona, Museu Diocesa), but the retable from S Sebastian, Guimera (completed 1412; Museu Episcopal, Vic), and the Virgin de la Llet from S María, Cervera (Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona), have also been attributed to him, although Post considered that he was a less refined draughtsman and a less sensitive painter than the Guimera Master."

Italian painter. He was educated initially in the workshop of Domenico Viola at Naples, but in 1708 he entered the school of Francesco Solimena, whose favourite pupil and most trusted collaborator he became. At first he followed closely Solimena's monumental Baroque manner, as in the frescoes (1715) in S Nicola alla Carità in Naples, but later developed a more controlled and refined style of rhythmical lines, light and airy colours and delicate psychological overtones. He employed this new style in his ten canvases of the Virtues and his vast Adoration of the Magi (all 1728; Naples, S Maria Donnaromita) and, above all, in his frescoes of the Adoration of the Magi in the apsidal dome of the church of the Nunziatella, Naples (1732; in situ). De Mura was also active as a portrait painter; his Portrait of the Artist's Wife (c. 1730; Naples, Pio Monte della Misericordia) and Self-portrait (c. 1730; Florence, Uffizi) are both very much in Solimena's manner.

His early career is not well documented, but he started working in a naturalistic tenebrist style, showing the influence of Zurbaran. After making his reputation with a series of eleven paintings on the lives of Franciscan saints for the Franciscan monastery in Seville (1645-46, the pictures are now dispersed in Spain and elsewhere), he displaced Zurbaran as the city's leading painter and was unrivalled in this position for the rest of his life.

From 1667 to 1669 Naiveu was apprenticed to the Leiden 'Fine' painter Gerrit Dou, who received 100 guilders a year (an exceptionally high sum) for instructing Naiveu. In 1671 Naiveu entered the Leiden Guild of St Luke, of which he became the head in 1677 and again in 1678, the year in which he moved to Amsterdam, where he was later appointed hop inspector.

"
3528,"NALDINI, Giovan Battista","(b. ca. 1537, Fiesole, d. 1591, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/naldini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He was the artistic heir of Jacopo Pontormo, with whom he trained from 1549 to 1556. While maintaining an allegiance to the ideals of Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo, he also worked in the vocabularies of Bronzino and Vasari. From these sources he forged an individual style of drawing indebted to del Sarto in its loose handling of chalk and reminiscent of Pontormo in its schematic figures defined by firm contours and modelled with loose hatching or spots of wash. There are an analogous stylization and an expressive freedom in his treatment of serpentine figures, which are sculptural in form but painterly in detail, arranged in compact compositions with concentrated lights revealing passages of warm yellows, reds and greens. Particularly characteristic is the Christ Carrying the Cross (1566; Florence, S Maria Assunta), which is distinguished in its colouring and expressive figures from the chill linearity and metallic forms of Bronzino, Vasari and Alessandro Allori."

Its subject is not stated, but it may perhaps be identified as the St John the Baptist (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence). On 30 April 1420 Nanni was asked to complete a statue of Joshua begun by Bernardo Ciuffagni in 1415 for the east side of the campanile. The identity of this figure is uncertain.

He was one of the most successful artists at the court of Louis XV, excelling in the vogue for painting women in mythological or allegorical fancy dress - or undress - transforming his matrons into goddesses (Mme de Lambesc as Minerva, Louvre, Paris, 1737). His portraits are little concerned with individual characterization, but they show fluency, vivacity, and a relaxed charm. He was at his best with women and has been accused of 'painting with make-up', a comment that suggests the pastel-like delicacy of his handling. Taste was turning against him towards the end of his career and some of his later work shows signs of fatigue. His brother Jean-Baptiste was also a painter; he committed suicide after being expelled by the Académie.



"
3545,"NATUS, Johannes",(active 1658-1662 in Middelburg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/natus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Active in Middelburg, Natus is recorded as a member of the guild in that city in late 1661 or early 1662, and he appears to have specialized in genre scenes.


"
3546,"NAVARRETE, Juan Fernández de","(b. ca. 1538, Logroño, d. 1579, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/navarret/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and draughtsman. He was a deaf mute, and the principal sources for his life and work are writings by Fray José de Sigüenza and Ceán Bermúdez. He received his early training in the Hieronymite monastery of La Estrella in Logroño, and as a young man he travelled in Italy, visiting Milan, Rome, Naples and Venice."
3547,"NAVEZ, François-Joseph","(b. 1787, Charleroi, d. 1869, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/navez/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter. He studied from 1803 to 1808 under Joseph François at the Brussels Académie. While still a student, he won several prizes; the Brussels Société des Beaux-Arts, impressed by his Virgil Reading the Aeneid (untraced), which won first prize at the 1812 Ghent Salon, offered him a grant to continue his studies in Paris. From 1813 to 1816 he made rapid progress in the studio of David, with whom he returned to Brussels when the latter was exiled in 1816. The two artists became particularly close, and Navez's works from this time, such as the De Hemptinne Family (1816; Brussels, Musée d'Art ancien) and St Veronica (1816; private collection), strongly reflect David's influence in their technical accomplishment and naturalism."
3548,"NAZARI, Bartolomeo","(b. 1699, Clusone, d. 1758, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nazari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of the late-Baroque, mainly active in Venice as a portraitist. By 1716, he had become an apprentice under Angelo Trevisani, but visited in 1723 the Roman studio of Angelo's brother, the Venetian Francesco Trevisani, and then also studied with Benedetto Luti. Nazari likely knew personally Fra Galgario, the renown portraitist from Bergamo, and is described by some as a pupil."
3549,"NEBBIA, Cesare","(b. ca. 1536, Orvieto, d. 1614, ?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nebbia/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist painter, pupil of Girolamo Muziano. He worked with his master on the decoration of the Orvieto Cathedral in the 1560s. (The remaining works in Orvieto are now in the Museo del Duomo.) Nebbia and Muziano became active in many late 16th-century projects in Rome. They, together with other Mannerist painters, decorated the Gregorian Chapel in the St Peter's Basilica during the administration of Gregory XIII (1572-1585)."
3550,"NEEFFS, Peeter the Elder","(b. ca. 1578, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1656, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neeffs/peeter_e/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of painters active in Antwerp. All three members of the family, Peeter Neefs the Elder and his sons Ludovicus Neeffs and Peeter Neeffs the Younger, specialized in paintings of architectural interiors. Their most frequent subject was the interior of Antwerp Cathedral; the details of sculpture, altars and paintings vary in accuracy, and sometimes the subject seems to be very freely interpreted. The Neefs also liked to depict the effects of artificial illumination in crypt-like spaces (in the manner of Hendrick van Steenwijck the Younger). Iconographic and stylistic similarities make the works of Peeter the Elder and Peeter the Younger often difficult to distinguish. Their paintings are generally small, painted on copper, and executed in a precise, neat way."
3551,"NEEFFS, Peeter the Younger","(b. 1620, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1675, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neeffs/peeter_y/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Pieter Neefs the Elder. By 1640 he was collaborating with his father and was never apparently enrolled as an independent master in the Guild of St Luke. He was still active in 1675, the year that appears on his last known dated painting (Vaduz, Sammlung Liechtenstein). He painted the same subjects as his father and it is very difficult to distinguish between their hands.



"
3552,"NEER, Aert van der","(b. 1603/04, Amsterdam, d. 1677, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neer/aert/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of the Baroque period, famous for his nocturnal landscapes.He probably did not begin his painting career until after 1630 and then was unable to make a reasonable living from his art. In 1658 he opened a wineshop, but this venture ended in bankruptcy in 1662. He probably reverted to painting, for he is described as a painter in the inventory that was made of his few belongings at the time of his death."
3553,"NEER, Eglon van der","(b. 1634, Amsterdam, d. 1703, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neer/eglon/biograph.html,"Eglon van der Neer was the son of Aert van der Neer, the Dutch landscapist active in Amsterdam. Eglon painted landscapes as well as history pictures, portraits, and genre scenes, was more peripatetic and had greater financial success than his father.

"
3554,"NEGRI, Pietro","(b. ca. 1628, Venezia, d. ca. 1679, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/negri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice. His first teacher of painting was Matteo Ponzone (1583-after 1663); later he was a pupil of Francesco Ruschi, along with Antonio Zanchi, Francesco Rosa (1635-1710) and Federico Cervelli."
3555,"NEGROLI, Filippo",(documented 1525-1551 in Milan),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/negroli/biograph.html,"
Filippo Negroli was the most innovative and celebrated Italian armourer of the period. For a clientele that included the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; King Francis I of France and the dukes of Urbino, he made magnificent parade armour: intricately worked helmets, cuirasses, shields and other showoff pieces designed more for ceremonial than battle use. Adapted from motifs of antiquity, they flatteringly conferred on their wearers the exalted aspect of Roman emperors, generals and mythological figures like Hercules."
3556,"NELLI, Ottaviano","(b. ca. 1370, Gubbio, d. ca. 1444, Gubbio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nelli/biograph.html,"
Ottaviano di Martino Nelli, Italian painter. His brother Tommaso and his father, Martino Nelli (or Melli), are both documented as painters. His grandfather Mello di Gubbio is undocumented but signed the Virgin and Child in Glory (Gubbio, Museo del Duomo), a panel previously attributed to Guiduccio Palmerucci (active 1315-1349). In 1403 Nelli signed a polyptych of the Virgin and Child with Saints (ex-S Agostino, Pietralunga; Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Perugia), a work that shows the influence both of local stylistic traditions and of Orvietan painting. Later, Nelli was influenced by Sienese and Bolognese painters and, more importantly, by Lombard and Burgundian styles."
3557,"NELLI, Plautilla","(b. 1523, Firenze, d. 1588, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nelli_p/biograph.html,"
Plautilla (Pulisena) Nelli, Italian painter. Daughter of a painter, Luca Nelli, she entered the convent of Santa Caterina di Siena in Florence in 1537. She studied painting with Fra Paolino, a pupil of Fra Bartolomeo, and executed works, including altarpieces, for her convent and outside patrons. In the Last Supper (Florence, Santa Maria Novella), executed from a cartoon by Agnolo Bronzino and reminiscent of Fra Bartolomeo's restrained early style, the still-life and the starched tablecloth are carefully observed. For the Deposition (Florence, Museo San Marco) she was reputed to have used the corpse of a nun for the figure of Christ. The Adoration of the Magi (Parma, Galleria Nazionale), her own composition, is reminiscent of Andrea del Sarto with its graceful drapery and harmony of light and shade."
3558,"NERI, Pietro Martire","(b. 1601, Cremona, d. 1661, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was trained in Mantua under the tutelage of Domenico Fetti, whose workshop he attended, and whose paintings he copied. Then he returned to Cremona, where we see him already drawn to portraiture. After a first, brief sojourn in Rome, he spent time once again in Lombardy, where he was active in Cremona, Mantua (carrying out commissions for the Gonzaga), Pavia and also Milan, where he worked for very prominent families such as the Borromeo and the Counts della Riviera, a branch of the Sfondrati  family."
3559,"NERLY, Friedrich","(b. 1807, Erfurt, d. 1878, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nerly/biograph.html,"
Christian Friedrich Nerly (also Federico Nerlich), German painter. Born in Erfurt, he was raised by relatives in Hamburg, following the death of his father. In the artistic milieu of Hamburg, Nerly soon became the protégé of the artist, writer and patron Baron Carl Friedrich von Rumohr (1785-1843), who encouraged the young artist's talent for observing nature. In 1827, patron and pupil undertook extensive travels throughout Germany, and during a visit to Weimar, Nerly made the acquaintance of Goethe."
3560,NEROCCIO DE' LANDI,"(b. 1445, Siena, d. 1500, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nerocci/biograph.html,"
Sienese painter and sculptor. He was a pupil of Vecchietta and worked in partnership with Francesco di Giorgio until 1475. Most of his paintings are representations of the Virgin and Child with Saints, but one of his finest works is a Portrait of a Girl in the National Gallery in Washington. He continued the elegant and refined Sienese tradition that stretched back to Duccio and his work is particularly noted for its delicate colouring.



"
3561,"NESSENTHALER, Elias","(b. 1664, Augsburg, d. 1714, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nessenth/biograph.html,"

"
3562,"NETSCHER, Caspar","(b. 1639, Prague, d. 1684, The Hague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/netscher/caspar/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Houbraken makes inconsistent statements about his birthplace, mentioning both Heidelberg and Prague, and there is similar doubt about his birthdate. Most of his career was spent in The Hague, where he settled in 1661/62, but he trained in Deventer with Terborch. From his master he took his predilection for depicting costly materials - particularly white satin. He painted genre scenes and some religious and mythological subjects, but from about 1670 he devoted himself almost exclusively to portraits, often for court circles in The Hague. His reputation was such that Charles II invited him to England. His work, elegant, Frenchified, small in scale, and exquisitely finished, influenced Dutch portraiture into the 18th century, his followers including his sons Constantijn and Theodor (1661-1732).



"
3563,"NETSCHER, Constantijn","(b. 1668, Den Haag, d. 1723, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/netscher/constant/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, son of Caspar Netscher and brother of the painters Theodorus (1661-1728) and Anthonie (1679-1713) Netscher. He is known for portraits, historical allegories, and Italianate landscapes.



"
3564,"NEUFCHATEL, Nicolas","(b. ca. 1527, Hennegau, d. 1590, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neufchat/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in Germany. He was one of the leading portrait painters in Germany in the 1560s, and it is likely that he was the 'Colyn van Nieucasteel' listed in the archives of Antwerp's Guild of St Luke in 1539 as a pupil of Pieter Coecke van Aelst. Although his teacher was not a portrait painter, in Antwerp Neufchatel was exposed to the art of Frans Floris, the young Willem Key and the Master of the 1540s, whose work has been postulated as Neufchatel's juvenilia. Joachim von Sandrart, writing in 1675, thought that Neufchatel trained and worked in Mons c. 1540."
3565,"NEUGEBAUER, Josef","(b. 1810, Wien, d. 1895, Melk)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neugebau/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter and composer. As a painter he is largely forgotten today in spite of the fact that he was skilled in many areas as a result of his broad education at the Vienna Academy with the professors Petter, Redl, Ender and Kupelwieser.



"
3566,"NEUMANN, Balthasar","(b. 1687, Eger, Bohemia, d. 1753, Würzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neumann/biograph.html,"

3567,"NEUREUTHER, Eugen","(b. 1806, München, d. 1882, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neureuth/biograph.html,"
German lithographer, illustrator, decorative artist and painter. He was the son of the painter and printmaker Ludwig Neureuther (d. 1832), and began his studies in Munich in 1823. His tutors included Peter von Cornelius, who enlisted him and several other young painters to help decorate the Glyptothek, and Wilhelm von Kobell. In 1830, fired with enthusiasm for the July Revolution in France, Neureuther went to Paris. He produced numerous studies from life (Munich, Staatliche. Graphische Sammlung), which are among his best works. From 1836-37 he was in Rome. From 1848 to 1856 he ran the Nymphenburg Porzellanmanufaktur, and for ten years from 1868 he taught decorative mural painting at the Munich Kunstgewerbeschule."
3568,"NEWDIGATE, Roger","(b. 1719, Arbury, d. 1806, Arbury)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/newdigat/biograph.html,"
English politician, collector of antiquities and architect. He was educated at Westminster School and University College, Oxford, and contributed greatly to the university throughout the remainder of his life. He is most remembered as the founder of the Newdigate Prize on his death and as a collector of antiques, a number of which he donated to the University. From 1742 until 1747, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesex, and in 1751, he began a 30-year tenure as an MP for Oxford University."
3569,"NEYN, Pieter de","(b. 1597, Leiden, d. 1639, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neyn/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. His father apprenticed him to a mason, where he stayed a few years but decided to study further, specifically the fields of mathematics and architecture. His parents could not pay for a proper education, and he became good enough at masonry that he began to teach others. He became friends with painters, particularly landscape painter Esaias van de Velde, who helped him with his paints and gave him tips how to become a good landscape painter."
3570,"NEYTS, Gillis","(b. 1623, Gent, d. 1687, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/neyts/biograph.html,"
Gillis (Aegidius) Neyts, Flemish painter, draughtsman and engraver. He was a landscape artist who is now mainly known for his Italianising and topographical drawings of sites throughout the Southern Netherlands. His subjects are either imaginary, idealised panoramas or topographical views of towns and villages. He created several etchings, sometimes after his drawings,"
3571,"NICCOLINI, Antonio","(b. 1772, Firenze, d. 1850, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolin/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, scenographer, and writer. He is best known for rebuilding the interior of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples after it burned down in 1816. He was also an active scenographer for the theatre. Raffaele del Ponte (1813-1872) was one of his pupils. He published a number of treatises on architecture from Pompeii and Herculaneum.



"
3572,NICCOLO DELL' ARCA,(active 1462-94 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/arca/biograph.html,"
Early Renaissance Italian sculptor (also called Niccolò da Bari) famed for his expressionistic use of northern Gothic realism in combination with true compositional principles of Renaissance art. Niccolò takes his name from the tomb (arca in Italian) of St. Dominic in the church of San Domenico, Bologna, where he made the canopy and most of the freestanding figures (1469-94). His masterpiece is the passionately dramatic lamentation over the dead Christ (six figures; 1463, Santa Maria della Vita, Bologna, now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna). Another terra-cotta sculpture group of the Madonna and saints (1478) is above the main entrance of the Palazzo Comunale in Bologna."
3573,NICCOLÒ DA BOLOGNA,(active 1349-1403 in Bologna),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/bologna/biograph.html,"
Niccolò di Giacomo di Nascimbene, usually known as Niccolò da Bologna, was one of the most important and prolific manuscript illuminators in fourteenth century Bologna. He is known for his expressive figures and crowded, action-filled narrative scenes."
3574,NICCOLÒ DI BUONACCORSO,"(active 1356, d. 1388, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/buonacco/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is presumed to have been the son of the painter Buonaccorso di Pace (active c. 1348-c. 1362). His name first appears in the membership list of the Sienese painters' guild in 1355-56. In May and June 1372 and in March and April 1376 he participated in the government of Siena. He was Gonfaloniere for the Terzo di San Martino in 1381."
3575,NICCOLÒ DA FOLIGNO,"(b. ca. 1430, Foligno, d. 1502, Foligno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/foligno/biograph.html,"
Niccolò da Foligno (Niccolò di Liberatore, erroneously called Niccolò Alunno by Vasari) was one of the grand Umbrian masters in the second half of the Quattrocento. He was probably a pupil of his father-in-law, Pietro Mazzaforte, and of Benozzo Gozzoli. The type of the languishing Madonnas and saints, which also characterizes the Umbrian school amongst other, first appears in his work (perhaps influenced by Taddeo di Bartolo).


"
3576,NICCOLÒ DI PIETRO GERINI,"(active 1366, Firenze, d. ca. 1415, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/gerini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He worked mainly in Florence, although he also carried out commissions in Pisa and Prato. He is first definitely recorded in 1368 as a member of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Florence but is almost certainly identifiable with the 'Niccolò dipintore' who collaborated with Jacopo di Cione in 1366 on frescoes for the Guildhall of the Judges and Notaries in Florence (destroyed). It is also likely that he is the 'Niccolaio dipintore' who worked with Jacopo di Cione on the altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin (London, National Gallery) for S Pier Maggiore, Florence, in 1370. In November of that year he was paid 12 gold florins 'per disegnare la tavola dell'altare', on which he had worked for 14 days. He probably designed the altarpiece and the elaborate throne canopy and left the execution to Jacopo di Cione. He is again documented as working with Jacopo di Cione on a Coronation of the Virgin (Florence, Accademia) commissioned by the Zecca Vecchia (mint) in 1372. Probably he was responsible for the design and Jacopo for the execution."
3577,NICCOLÒ,(active c. 1120-1150),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/niccolo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, master mason. He engraved his name on the cathedral façade in Ferrara in 1137, and it is assumed that he was a pupil of Wiligelmo in Modena. Niccolò's works seem to be inspired less by the Classical period than by his predecessor, though they scarcely match his power of expression. Nonetheless, his figures have a special vividness which also comes through in the garments they wear.

Niccolò also worked in Verona; pieces in the church of San Zeno, and in particular the jamb figures on the cathedral's portal are ascribed to him and his workshop.


"
3578,NICCOLÒ DI PIETRO,(known 1394-1440 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/pietro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His father, Pietro (fl 1365–89), and grandfather Niccolò (fl 1365) were both painters. Niccolò appears to have been an independent master by 1394, when he signed a panel depicting the Virgin and Child Enthroned (Venice, Accademia). In 1404 he signed and dated a Crucifix (Verucchio, SS Martino e Francesco), and between 1414 and 1416 he executed a processional banner (untraced) for the Scuola Grande della Misericordia in Venice. He is last documented on 4 October 1430.



"
3579,NICCOLÒ PISANO,"(b. 1470, Pisa, d. ca. 1538, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/pisano/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (Niccolò dell'Abbruggia). He was first documented as a painter in 1489: he was an employee of Perugino in Rome in 1489-93. His first recorded work was in Pisa, where he produced the altarpiece of the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints and the associated predella of the Adoration of the Magi and Slaughter of the Innocents (?1493; Pisa, Museo Nazionale S. Matteo). In 1499 he was commissioned to participate in the decoration of the choir of Ferrara Cathedral and subsequently he was one of the painters who received a salary from Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. In Ferrara he also executed an altarpiece of the Virgin and Child Enthroned between SS James and Helen (1512-14; Milan, Brera). On the basis of stylistic comparisons with this, he has been attributed with several works, including the altarpiece of the Holy Family with Four Crowned Saints (1520; Worcester, MA, Art Museum). In Ferrara he collaborated with Lorenzo Costa and Niccolò Rossetti."
3580,NICCOLÒ DI SEGNA,(active 1331-1345 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/segna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of Segna di Bonaventura. He followed the style of Duccio with a greater rigidity of the forms. He was also influenced by Simone Martini as seen in the Crucifixion (1345, Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena) and in the frescoes attributed to him (S. Colomba a Monteriggioni near Siena).



"
3581,NICCOLÒ DI SER SOZZO,"(d. 1363, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/sozzo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. The superb illustration of the Assumption of the Virgin in the Caleffo Bianco (a register of state documents in the Siena Archive) and the polyptych of the Virgin and Child with Four Saints (Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale) are signed by Niccolò di ser Sozzo. The polyptych is also signed by Luca di Tommè with the date 1362. In 1348 Niccolò was in debt to the Siena Comune, and in 1363 he was mentioned in the city's Libro delle Arti. He has been associated with documents referring to services undertaken on behalf of the Siena Comune, but these relate to the son of a notary, ser Sozzo di Francesco Tegliacci. The painter of the signed miniature and polyptych was probably the son of an obscure Sienese illuminator, ser Sozzo di Stefano.



"
3582,NICCOLÒ DI TOMMASO,(active 1350-1380),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/niccolo/tommaso/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, probably born in Pistoia during the first half of the fourteenth century. There are a handful of paintings made by him between 1350 and 1380, such as the S. Antonio triptych of 1571 (Museum of S. Martino, Naples), SS. Giovanni e Paolo (Horne Collection, Florence), and the Nativity (Johnson Collection, Philadelphia Museum of Art). The chapel of the Tau monastery in Pistoia, recently restored, houses a fresco cycle which were carried out in the last three decades of the fourteenth century by Niccolò di Tommaso and some of his assistants. In the 1370s he was also active in Naples.



"
3583,"NICKELEN, Isaak van","(b. ca. 1632, Haarlem, d. 1703, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nickelen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of church interiors. There is little surviving information about his life. He was a businessman as well as an artist, and had interests in silk trading and glass manufacturing. Based on a not in an auction catalogue of 1711, stating that he had painted figures in an interior by Pieter Jansz Saenredam, and on the fact that his paintings are strongly influenced  by the older master, it was presumed that he was Saenredam's pupil. There is, however, no documentary evidence in support of this hypothesis."
3584,"NICOL, Erskine","(b. 1825, Leith, d. 1904, Feltham)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nicol/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He began his career at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, where he was a pupil of William Allan (1782-1850) and Thomas Duncan (1807-1845). In his early twenties he moved to Ireland to take up a teaching post under the Department of Science and Art. He lived in Dublin from 1845 to 1850 and travelled extensively throughout the country. These first years in Ireland coincided with the great famine, and the condition of the rural poor was often reflected in his work. Nicol later resided in London but returned almost annually to Ireland."
3585,NICOLA DA URBINO,"(b. ca. 1480, Urbino, d. ca. 1538, Urbino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nicola/biograph.html,"
Italian ceramicist, maiolica painter. Until the 1980s, when he was identified in the Urbino archives as Nicola di Gabriele Sbraghe, the identity of the man who signed his works Nicola da Urbino remained unknown. Nicola was recorded in Urbino from 1520 as the owner of a workshop and was called maestro (master), but frustratingly little else is known about this talented maiolica master of the sixteenth century."
3586,NICHOLAS OF VERDUN,(active 1181–1205),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nicolas/biograph.html,"
French goldsmith. His known works indicate that he was one of the leading metalworkers of his day and an early exponent of the classicising styles around 1200 that formed a transition between Romanesque and Gothic. In his two dated signatures, ""NICOLAUS VIRDUNENSIS (1181)"" on the enamel decoration of the former pulpit in Klosterneuburg Abbey, Austria, and ""MAGISTER NICHOLAUS DE VERDUM (1205)"" on the Shrine of the Virgin in Tournai Cathedral, the artist gave as his place of origin Verdun, in Lorraine, an area that in the 12th century had close economic and cultural links with the Rhineland, Champagne, the Ile-de-France and the metalworking centres of the Meuse. A more ambiguous signature, ""NICOLAUS DE VERDA"", was on the pedestal of one of a lost pair of enthroned, silver-gilt statuettes in Worms Cathedral representing St Peter and the founder Queen Constance, the wife either of Emperor Henry VI (m. 1186; d 1198) or of Emperor Frederick II (m. 1209; d 1222). The spelling Verda may perhaps be a defect or a copyist's error. The theory that Nicholas spent his last years as a citizen of Tournai, or had a son there of the same name, was based on mistaken evidence: the reference to a 'namesake' dates from 1318, not 1217, and concerns not a painter on glass (voirier) but a furrier (vairier)."
3587,"NICOLAU, Pere","(active 1390, d. 1408, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nicolau/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Originally from Catalonia, he was described as a 'citizen of Valencia' in 1390, when he was paid for work in the cathedral there. This was the first of many commissions in Valencia Cathedral, some of which were undertaken jointly with Andrés Marzal de Sax. Nicolau also received royal commissions for Martin I of Aragon and worked for churches in the province of Teruel, which attests to his renown. He founded an important school and evidently trained Gonçal Peris and the Master of Burgo de Osma."

Painter, draughtsman, engraver and broker, member of a Dutch family of artists of Flemish origin. The family can be traced back as far as Jacob van Nijeulandt, who is recorded as a citizen of Antwerp in 1561. One of his four children, Willem van Nieulandt (1533-96), married Adriana Nouts (d 1608), and they had three sons: Willem van Nieulandt I (1560-1626), Joris van Nieulandt (1561-1626) and Adriaen van Nieulandt (d 1603). Willem I was the first artist in the family. A painter and draughtsman, he lived and worked in Rome, where he was known as Guglielmo Terranova and where he became a member of the Accademia di S Luca in 1604. His brother Adriaen was a pedlar and pen merchant and moved to Amsterdam with his family in 1589, probably because they were Calvinists. Adriaen's sons, Willem van Nieulandt II, Adriaen van Nieulandt the Younger and Jacob van Nieulandt, all became painters."

3590,"NIGETTI, Matteo","(b. ca. 1565, Firenze, d. 1648, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nigetti/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He was a pupil and assistant of Bernardo Buontalenti, with whom he worked on the Palazzo Non Finito (1593). Nigetti's principal work, however, was the Cappella dei Principi, the funerary chapel of the Medici family in San Lorenzo, Florence, on which he spent over 40 years (1604-48) supervising the construction. This was a major enterprise for the Medici."
3591,"NIGG, Joseph","(b. 1782, Wien, d. 1863, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nigg/biograph.html,"
Austrian Biedermeier painter. Having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Johann Baptist Drechsler (1756-1811), Nigg began working in a Viennese porcelain factory as a flower painter.  He continued to work there over the next forty years, also holding painting classes."
3592,"NIKITIN, Ivan Nikitich","(b. 1680s, Moscow, d. ca. 1742)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nikitin/biograph.html,"
Russian painter. The son of a Moscow priest who was close to the imperial court, Nikitin received his first artistic lessons from a Dutch artist Schwonbek at the engraving shop of the Kremlin Armoury. He subsequently worked chiefly in St. Petersburg when in 1711 the Armory was moved there. In 1716-1720 he and his brother Roman Nikitin were sent to Italy by Peter the Great. The brothers learnt the art of painting at Florence and Venice. After returning to Russia Nikitin became the favourite court painter of Peter the Great. He worked in Moscow and Saint Petersburg."
3593,"NITTIS, Giuseppe de","(b. 1846, Barletta, d. 1884, Saint-Germain-en-Laye)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nittis/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, pastelist and printmaker. Throughout his career he was committed to a plein-air aesthetic and was particularly interested in rendering varying light effects, a concern that brought him into contact with the Impressionists. He was also acquainted with the members of the Macchiaioli, for whom his work was influential. In addition to oils, he experimented with printmaking and made innovative use of pastels. Practicing a restrained, and therefore 'acceptable', form of Impressionism, he achieved great success in his lifetime, both nationally and internationally.



"
3594,"NOBILE, Pietro","(b. 1774, Campestro, d. 1854, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nobile/biograph.html,"
Swiss architect and engineer, active in Austria as Peter von Nobile. He is regarded as one of the most prominent architects of the late Classicism in Vienna and the leading architect of the Habsburg court."
3595,"NOCRET, Jean","(b. 1617, Nancy, d. 1672, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nocret/biograph.html,"
French portrait painter who achieved a considerable reputation with the French court. He was an archaising artist, much influenced by Frans Pourbus the Younger. His son, Jean-Charles Nocret (1647-1719) continued his father's tradition of official portraiture.



"
3596,"NOËL, Alexandre-Jean","(b. 1752, Brie-Comte-Robert, d. 1834, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/noel/biograph.html,"
French painter. On a scientific expedition to observe the transit of Venus in Baja California, Mexico, Alexandre-Jean Noël and the other Europeans found the native Indians' food ""impossible, especially for a Frenchman."" Only sixteen, Noël served as the expedition's draftsman, documenting natives, lizards, and the mission in San José del Cabo in watercolour views. Some time after his return, the secretary of the Académie Royale recommended purchasing Noël's Mexican drawings for the royal collection. The purchase was approved, and Noël's drawings of ""all that is curious in costume, drawn on the spot and with truth by an artist who has some talent"" are now in the Musée du Louvre."
3597,"NOFRI, Andrea","(b. 1388, Firenze, d. ca. 1455, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nofri/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He is probably identical with Andrea di Onofrio, also called Andrea da Firenze. In Neapolitan documents he is also called Andrea Ciccione. In 1419 he was documented as executing a coat of arms over the door of the lodgings of Pope Martin V in the cloister of S Maria Novella, Florence. In 1420 he sculpted statues and ornamentation for the chapel of St Lawrence in S Lucia de' Bardi, Florence. Five years later he assessed one of Donatello's statues for the Campanile (probably the Jeremiah). Later he worked in the cloister of S Francesco at Prato and in November 1428 in Florence as a 'lastrajuolo' (stonecutter) for Michelozzo and Donatello. He worked also in Naples.



"
3598,"NOGARI, Giuseppe","(b. 1699, Venezia, d. 1766, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nogari/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Recorded as a member of the Venetian guild of painters from 1726 onwards, he is traditionally thought to have been trained under Antonio Balestra, although it is more likely that his true master was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta. From his earliest known works, the four Heads (before 1736; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) painted for the patron and collector Count Carl Gustav Tessin, it is evident that Nogari was influenced by the portraits of Rosalba Carriera and in particular the work of Rembrandt, whose drawings Nogari knew when they were in the collection formed by Zaccaria Sagredo. Nogari would also have known the Rembrandt prints owned from 1720 by Anton Maria Zanetti the elder."
3599,"NOIERS, Geoffrey de",(active c. 1189-1200),https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/noiers/biograph.html,"
English master-mason responsible for part of the rebuilding of the Gothic Lincoln Cathedral from 1192. He was possibly a Norman who acquired his trade in France and settled in Lincoln. The vault of St Hugh's Choir (1192-1200), by him, is probably the first case in Gothic Europe where the emphasis was on decorative rather than structural ribs, and he was perhaps also responsible for the three-dimensional blind overlaid arcading on the walls of St Hugh's Choir. However, Richard the Mason (active 1190s) was also involved, and the original design of the Gothic Cathedral may be his.

Dutch sculptor, scion of a family of sculptors from Cambrai and Utrecht,, brother of Jean de Nole (d. 1624); not to be confused with his supposed uncle Robert Nole from Cambrai (active 1546-1566). He is also known as Robert (Robrecht) Colijns de Nole."
3602,"NOLLEKENS, Joseph Francis","(b. 1702, Antwerpen, d. 1748, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nolleken/francis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England. He first studied under his father, Jan Baptiste Nollekens, and later worked with him in France, where he learnt to make imitations of Antoine Watteau's fêtes galantes; during his first visit to England, after 1718, he studied under the landscape painter Peter Tillemans."
3603,"NOLLEKENS, Joseph","(b. 1737, London, d. 1823, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nolleken/joseph/biograph.html,"Neoclassical sculptor whose busts made him the most fashionable English portrait sculptor of his day.

"
3604,"NOMÉ, François de","(b. 1593, Metz, d. 1644, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nome/biograph.html,"
It is only in recent years that the mysterious painter called ""Monsù Desiderio"" has been separated into two artists who collaborated: Didier Barra (1590-c. 1644) and François de Nomé, both from Metz, Lorraine. Didier Barra usually painted topographical views, chiefly of Naples. François de Nomé was the more adventurous of the two, concentrating on the bizarre. Both painters spent their entire careers in Naples  but never assimilated any local influences; they both retained a form of archaising mannerism of a similar type to that of Claude Deruet. At their best, François de Nomé's pictures excite by their power of expression, even though they seem flagrantly to disobey almost every rule of art.



"
3605,"NOMELLINI, Plinio","(b. 1866, Livorno, d. 1943, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nomellin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After studying in Livorno, he received a local grant that enabled him to enrol at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, where he studied under Giovanni Fattori and became friends with the painters Telemaco Signorini and Silvestro Lega. He exhibited works both in Florence and, in 1889, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. Around 1890 he moved to Genoa, where he was based until 1902. He developed a marked interest in radical politics, in 1894 being charged with anarchism and imprisoned for several months. Nomellini's house in Genoa became a meeting place for artists and writers and his painting had an important influence on turn-of-the-century Ligurian Divisionists."
3606,"NONNOTTE, Donat","(b. 1708, Besançon, d. 1785, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nonnotte/biograph.html,"
French painter. He began his training in his native Besançon with an uncle, Jean Nonnotte. When about 20 years old he moved to Paris, where he studied under François Lemoyne and found an influential patron in the Duc d'Antin, Surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi. Nonnotte was thus well positioned for a career as a history painter. His first works included wall and ceiling paintings, which he completed in 1730-32 at the château of Versailles, where he worked as Lemoyne's assistant, and in the churches of St Sulpice and St Thomas d'Aquin in Paris."
3607,"NONO, Luigi","(b. 1850, Fusine, d. 1918, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nono/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied in Venice under Pompeo Molmenti (1819-1894), and his early works are in the style of the Venetian Macchiaioli. In later years, he painted landscapes and portraits as well as highly successful pathetic and religious subjects, where his initial verism shaded into a conventional melancholy in the manner of Francesco Paolo Michetti (1851-1929).



"
3608,"NOOMS, Reiner","(b. ca. 1623, Amsterdam, d.1664, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nooms/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman and etcher. He was probably self-taught as an artist, since much of his early career was spent as a sailor on Dutch merchant vessels, travelling the major Dutch trade routes to Paris, Italy and the North African coast. His works frequently depict marine scenes and coastal views of the ports he visited. Throughout his career he proudly identified himself by the surname 'Zeeman' (Dutch: Seaman), by which title he regularly signed his works. He is now known principally as a painter of ships, whose work falls within the last two stylistic phases of 17th-century Dutch marine painting. Some of his paintings demonstrate the interest in light and atmosphere that typified the mid-century 'tonal' phase and can be seen in the work of Willem van de Velde the Elder. Other works, such as Nooms's views of sea battles and Italian ports, have a romantic character that anticipates the more dramatic style of the late 17th century.



"
3609,"NOORDT, Jan van","(b. ca. 1623, Amsterdam, d. after 1676, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/noordt/biograph.html,"
Jan van Noordt (also Joan van Noort), Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam. He was the pupil of Jacob Backer who greatly influenced his early style, but he also experimented with the effects of colour and light that Rembrandt had employed in his biblical small figure paintings. He produced history, mythological and religious paintings as well as portraits and Italianate landscapes."
3610,"NOORT, Adam van","(b. 1562, Antwerpen, d. 1641, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/noort/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in Antwerp. He owes his reputation particularly to the fact that he was one of Rubens's teachers and also later of his son-in-law Jacob Jordaens. His sparse surviving work consists mainly of rather small-sized paintings of religious subjects and portraits. There is documentary evidence that he was involved in the production of altarpieces."
3611,"NORDENBERG, Bengt","(b. 1822, Blekinge, d. 1902, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nordenbe/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter. Following a poor childhood he was educated as an artisan painter. In 1843 he enrolled at the art academy in Stockholm but had to break off his studies prematurely for lack of money. From an early age, Nordenberg had made up his mind to create a national painting depicting the lives of Swedish country people. His encounter with Adolph Tidemand's pictures of Norwegian rural life, executed in Düsseldorf, inspired him to make his way to Düsseldorf in 1851. There he became a student of Ferdinand Theodor Hildebrandt (1804-74). He also assisted Tidemand and travelled with him to Norway and Sweden in 1852."
3612,"NORDSTRÖM, Karl Fredrik","(b. 1855, Stenkyrka, Västra Götalan, d. 1923, Drottningholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nordstro/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter. Between 1875 and 1878 Nordström studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in Stockholm and the private painting school of Edvard Perseus (1841-1890). Traveling to Paris in 1881, he was influenced by the Impressionists. From 1882 to 1886 he lived in Grèz-sur-Loing, a centre of Impressionist plein-air painting south-east of Paris, the site of an important colony of Scandinavian artists. Here he met Larsson and Krohg. At first he was influenced by the Barbizon school and Bastien-Lepage, then turned to Impressionism."
3613,"NORIE, James","(b. 1684, Knockando, d. 1757, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/norie/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, part of a family of painters. James Norie and two of his sons, James (1711-1736) and Robert (c. 1720-1766), made their names as decorative landscape painters. Some of their works were commissioned as topographical records of specific locations but most of their paintings are imaginative, idealised views. These were strongly influenced by the classical landscapes of Claude Lorraine and Gaspard Dughet. Many were designed as elements in interior decorative schemes, sometimes painted in monochrome rather than full colour."
3614,"NOTKE, Bernt","(b. ca. 1440, Lassahn, d. 1509, Lübeck)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/notke/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, the leading wood-carver in the Baltic area during his period. He worked mainly in Lübeck, where he is first recorded (as a painter) in 1647, but his masterpiece was executed in Sweden, where he was summoned in 1483 to make a monument commemorating a victory by the Regent, Sten Sture, over the Danes. The victory was attributed to the assistance of St George, and Notke's stirring group of St George and the Dragon (completed 1489) in the Storkyrka (Stockholm's main church) is one of the greatest of all votive images. Its spiky forms represent the most expressionistic strain in late Gothic art and the vividly naturalistic details include the use of real elk antlers for the dragon's horns.

Couly Nouailher was a French enameller. Also known as Colin, a patois diminutive for Nicolas. The family name is also written as Noylier, Noualier, Noalher.  His signed works are inscribed 'Colin' or with the initials 'CN'. He was the son of Couly Nouailher I, also an enameller.



"
3617,"NOVELLI, Pietro","(b. 1603, Monreale, d. 1647, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/novelli/biograph.html,"Italian painter. Although he only started painting quite late, Novelli went on to become the most important Sicilian painter of the seventeenth century. One of his seminal influences came from studying the works Caravaggio had left on the island, particularly his Adoration of the Shepherds. Novelli also felt the influence of the Genoese school (especially through the paintings at the Oratory of Santo Stefano) and above all Anthony Van Dyck, who had been present in Sicily in 1624. These currents would persist throughout Novelli's career.

3618,"NOVELLI, Antonio","(b. 1600, Castelfranco di Sotto, d. 1662, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/novellia/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He spent most of his life in Florence, working mainly in marble, stone and stucco and providing models for goldsmiths. He was apprenticed to Gherardo Silvani (1579-1675) from 1614 to 1618 and then worked with the sculptor Agostino Bugiardini (d. 1623), whose unfinished works in the church of Santa Felicità, Florence, Novelli completed."
3619,"NÚÑEZ DE VILLAVICENCIO, Pedro","(b. 1640, Sevilla, d. 1700, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nunez/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was born into an aristocratic family and was educated for a military career. However, he turned to letters and painting at an early age, and in 1660 he was one of the artists who, with Murillo, founded the Academia de Pintura in Seville. In 1661 he joined the Jerusalem Order of the Knights of Malta and travelled to Malta, where he underwent religious and military training. There he met the Italian painter Mattia Preti, who was also a member of the Order; the two became friends and established a working relationship. From 1664 on Núñez de Villavicencio travelled to Italy and Spain in the service of the Order and on several occasions was able to return to Seville. He must also have passed through Madrid, as he is known to have been in contact with Charles II.

3620,"NÚÑEZ DELGADO, Gaspar","(b. ca. 1555, Ávila, d. 1606, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/n/nunezdel/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He spent his active life in Seville, where he probably was the pupil of Jerónimo Hernández and the painter Pedro Delgado. His work announces the transition from Mannerism to Baroque in Spanish sculpture. He is the author of several sculpted crucifixes. As a painter he showed great skill in dealing with the anatomy of his figures.

His son Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, who responded to early 17th-century Milanese art, was a more powerful artist. He became the leading painter in Lombardy in the mid-17th century, producing frescoes, altarpieces, devotional works and portraits. Carlo's younger brother Giuseppe Nuvolone assisted him. Giuseppe's art is of lower quality, yet richer in colour, and his many religious works spread the Baroque style throughout Lombardy."

Dutch painter and printmaker. The son of a baker, he was apprenticed at the age of 12 to Andreas Schelfhout in The Hague, and from 1825 to 1829 he went to the Hague Tekenacademie, under the direction of Bartholomeus J. van Hove. With remarkable rapidity Nuyen grew into a highly productive painter of landscapes, marines and townscapes; his favourite themes were the Normandy and northern French coasts. In 1829 he was awarded a medal by the Felix Meritis society in Amsterdam for a watercolour of a forest landscape (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). After completing his training he made several trips to Belgium, France and Germany, sometimes in the company of A. Waldorp (1803-66). In 1836 he was admitted to the Koninklijke Akademie in Amsterdam, and one year before his death he married Schelfhout's daughter.

He is documented in the painters' confraternity of St Luke in Florence in 1346, where he is described as 'de Senis', indicating a sojourn in Siena where he was strongly influenced by Ambrogio and Pietro Lorenzetti. In Florence, he responded particularly to the work of Bernardo Daddi. No signed or dated works exist from his Florentine period."

3630,"OCHTERVELT, Jacob","(b. 1634, Rotterdam, d. 1682, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ochterve/biograph.html,"
Ochtervelt was a Dutch genre painter active mainly in Rotterdam, but from 1674 he lived in Amsterdam. He was influenced by Pieter de Hooch and through him by Vermeer. Apart from a few portraits and some early hunting party and ""merry company"" scenes, his paintings are almost all elegant upper-class interiors, in which he showed off a skill in painting silks and satins to rival that of Terborch. His figures are extremely refined, but there is often a sexual element in his painting.

3631,"O'CONNOR, James Arthur","(b. 1792, Dublin, d. 1841, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oconnor/biograph.html,"
Irish painter. The son of a Dublin print-seller and engraver, he may have received instruction in painting from William Sadler (c. 1782-1839), a prolific Irish painter of small landscapes. O'Connor first exhibited in 1809 in Dublin; in 1813 he went to London with Francis Danby and George Petrie, intending to settle there, but soon returned home. His earliest achievement of note was a group of topographical views, commissioned in 1818 by the 2nd Marquis of Sligo and the 14th Earl of Clanricarde (private collection). Two of these, View of Westport with Croagh Patrick and its pendant Westport House from Barratt's Hill, demonstrate that O'Connor was then capable of fine painting in a tightly handled 18th-century manner and that he had learnt much from the example of the Irish landscape painter Thomas Roberts (1748-1778). Four views of Bridge House, Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo, and its environs (National Gallery, Dublin) were also commissioned at that time and are very nearly as accomplished."
3632,"ODEKERKEN, Willem van","(b. ca. 1610, Nijmegen, d. 1677, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/odekerke/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter.  He is recorded as a pupil in the records of the Hague painters' guild around 1631. In 1643 he enrolled in the Delft Guild of St. Luke and married Maria Sasbouts van der Dussen. He was one of the most important Delft decorative painters, receiving municipal and private commissions for public buildings and houses. Additionally he is recorded as a painter of genre scenes, still-lifes and church interiors. Today only a handful of his works remain, among them a small number of kitchen interiors of fairly large size showing figures of maids influenced by Flemish market and kitchen pieces and a pair showing a shepherd and shepherdess. 



"
3633,"ODERISI, Pietro",(active c. 1260-80),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oderisi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active also in England. His masterpiece is the Tomb of Pope Clement IV in the church of San Francesco in Viterbo. He is conceivable identical both with the Odericus who in 1268 signed the inlaid marble floor of the sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, and with the 'Petrus civis Romanus' who signed the now largely dismembered shrine of St Edward the Confessor, probably in 1269. The inlaid marble decoration of these two tombs is known as Cosmati work with geometric patterns characteristic of Roman workshops from the early twelfth to the beginning of the fourteenth century.



"
3634,"ODERISI, Roberto d'",(active ca. 1330-1382 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oderisid/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, one of the foremost painters in 14th-century Naples. We have few biographical information on this Neapolitan painter. Earlier works by the artist display a knowledge of the Tuscan school of painting and a particular awareness of the innovations of Giotto, who visited Naples with his assistants between 1328 and 1333. However, recent studies have convincingly put back the artistic work of Roberto in the second half of the fourteenth century, thus excluding its direct relationship with the presence of Giotto in Naples. His cultural background of the artist, which in any case was influenced by the paintings executed in Naples by Giotto and especially by Maso di Banco, is not free from a thorough knowledge of the Sienese painting (Simone Martini and the Lorenzetti)."
3635,ODERISIUS OF BENEVENTO,(active 1119-1150),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oderisiu/biograph.html,"

Italian bronze-caster. According to inscriptions, he made bronze doors for churches in Troia, Capua and Benevento. The doors of Troia Cathedral were commissioned by Bishop William II of Troia. The main doors, completed in 1119, include an image of Oderisius, while the south doors, completed in 1127, are engraved with his signature: FACTOR PORTARUM FUIT ODERISIUS HARUM BENEVENTANUS. The lost doors of San Giovanni, Capua, made in 1122 and inscribed MAGISTER ODERISIUS FECIT HAS PORTAS, were recorded in a 17th-century drawing, published by Salazaro. The doors of San Bartolommeo, Benevento, made in 1150 and engraved OPUS ODERISI, were melted down in 1693.

3636,"ODEVAERE, Joseph-Denis","(b. 1775, Bruges, d. 1830, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/odevaere/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He attended evening classes at the Bruges Academie in 1794-95 and then went to Paris, where he entered the studio of the Bruges artist Joseph-Benoît Suvée. In 1801 he began training under Jacques-Louis David and in 1804 won the Prix de Rome for his Death of Phocion (Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts), in which he faithfully adhered to the principles of David's teaching. Before going to Italy he spent a year in Bruges carrying out portrait commissions, including the Marquis de Chauvelin (1805; Bruges, Groeningemuseum)."
3637,"OEHME, Ernst Ferdinand","(b. 1797, Dresden, d. 1855, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oehme/biograph.html,"
German Romantic painter. He began his studies at the Dresden Art Academy in 1819, and became the pupil of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl. He devoted himself to painting nature in the vicinity of Dresden, in particular in the region called the Saxon Switzerland. In 1821 he presented at the Academy his painting Cathedral in Winter. This painting shows the influence of his friend Caspar David Friedrich."
3638,"OEVER, Hendrick ten","(b. 1639, Zwolle, d. 1716, Zwolle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oever/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He studied with Eva van Marle (active 1647-1654) in Zwolle before travelling to Amsterdam in 1659 where he took lessons from Cornelis de Bie (1621-1664) along with the brothers Johann Heinrich and Theodor Roos. He is considered to be a member of the Pieter de Hooch school of genre painting, along with Esaias Boursse, Hendrick van der Burch, Pieter Janssens Elinga, Cornelis de Man, and Jacob Vrel. In 1665 he was back in Zwolle."
3639,"OGGIONO, Marco d’","(b. ca. 1467, Milano, d. 1524, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oggiono/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is first documented in Milan in a contract of apprenticeship of 1487, when he undertook to teach Protasio Crivelli (d. after 1516) the art of painting miniatures; Marco must by that time have been a qualified master with a shop of his own. During the early 1490s he was in some way associated with Leonardo da Vinci: in September 1490 Leonardo's assistant Salai stole a valuable silverpoint pencil from Marco, who was then staying in the Florentine's house. In 1491 d'Oggiono and Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio were commissioned by the brothers of the late Archbishop Leonardo Griffi to paint an altarpiece for the newly constructed chapel of S Leonardo, attached to S Giovanni sul Muro, Milan; only the centrepiece of the work, a Resurrection with SS Leonardo and Lucy (Berlin, Staatliche Museen), survives. The Griffi Altarpiece was not finished until 1494. He is documented in Venice 1497-98 and in Savona 1501-02."
3640,"OHLMÜLLER, Joseph Daniel","(b. 1791, Bamberg, d. 1839, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ohlmulle/biograph.html,"
German architect. He studied with Karl von Fischer (1782-1820) at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. A travel scholarship enabled him to go to Italy for a longer period of study."
3641,"OLIS, Jan","(b. ca. 1610, Gorcum, d. 1676, Heusden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/olis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He painted for the most part genre scenes, particularly Merry Companies, in the manner of Anthonie Palamedesz and Jan Miense Molenaer. High and low genre conversation pieces depicting groups of elegant figures, soldiers, or peasants enjoying themselves, were very popular during the 17th century. Other artists who explored this theme included Pieter Codde, Hendrik Pot and Simon Kick."
3642,"OLIVEIRA, Mateus Vicente de","(b. 1706, Barcarena, d. 1785, Lisboa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oliveira/biograph.html,"
Portuguese architect. He studied under the architects Joao Frederico Ludovice (1670-1752) and Jean Baptiste Robillon (died 1782) during the construction of the royal palace at Mafra - Portugal's attempt to rival the Spanish king's palace at Escorial. He adopted Ludovice's grand manner, and then evolved a much more exquisite style, of which the Palácio Nacional, Queluz, near Lisbon (1747-52), is a good example, with its swagged and garlanded window-heads. It was completed by Robillon who also designed the gardens."
3643,"OLIVER, Isaac","(b. before 1568, Rouen, d. 1617, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oliver/isaac/biograph.html,"English miniaturist of French origin, the son of a refugee Huguenot goldsmith who settled in England in 1568. He trained under Hilliard (whose main rival he later became) and by 1590 was established in his own practice. Although Hilliard continued to receive royal favour under James I Oliver was made Limmer to the Queen Anne of Denmark in 1604, and was patronized by Henry, Prince of Wales, and his circle. His style was more naturalistic than that of Hilliard, using light and shade to obtain modelling and generally dispensing with the emblematic trappings so beloved of the Elizabethan age.

"
3644,"OLIVER, Peter","(b. ca. 1594, London, d. 1647, Isleworth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oliver/peter/biograph.html,"
English miniaturist, part of a family of artists, son of Isaac Oliver. The date of his birth is not recorded, and the traditional date of c. 1594 has been disputed, but there is evidence to support it. When making his will in 1617 Isaac made bequests to Peter on condition that he still 'exercise that art or science which he and I now doe', showing that he was then his father's assistant. One of his earliest known miniatures, Charles, Prince of Wales, as a Young Man (Windsor Castle, Royal Collection), is a modified version of his father's standard portrait and would be assigned on stylistic grounds to Isaac, were it not inscribed with Peter's monogram PO."
3645,"OLIVIER, Ferdinand","(b. 1785, Dessau, d. 1841, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/olivier/biograph.html,"
German painter, draughtsman and lithographer, brother of Heinrich Olivier. The brothers' mother was a court opera singer in Dessau, and Ferdinand's later interest in the German medieval and Nazarene styles owed much to the intellectual climate at the Anhalt-Dessau court, where Leopold III Frederick Francis, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, had been the first German prince to introduce the Gothic Revival style. Olivier took up drawing in 1801-02 under the tuition of Carl Wilhelm Kolbe and the engraver Johann Christian Haldenwang. In 1802-03 he accompanied his father to Berlin, where he studied woodcut techniques under Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Unger and may have attended August Wilhelm Schlegel's lectures on belles-lettres and art. It was here, at the latest, that he discovered Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (Berlin, 1797) by Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck, and the latter's Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen (Berlin, 1798), two books of vital significance for the painting of the Romantic era."
3646,"OLIVIERI, Pier Paolo","(b. 1551, Roma, d. 1599, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/olivieri/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect. Few details of his life are known, but his small oeuvre includes commissions for important public works that show he was successful in his time. He had already a successful career before Sixtus V's pontificate, with the colossal statue of Gregory XIII in Santa Maria Aracoeli (c. 1585) and the monument to Gregory XI in San Francesca Romana (1584) He could boast of a solid apprenticeship in the antique. Documents also seem to indicate his activity as an architect in the building site of S Andrea della Valle, and in the planning of the Sacramento altar in S Giovanni in Laterano. At the end of the century he completed the altar of the holy sacrament in San Giovanni in Laterano, in gilded bronze."
3647,"OLIVIERI, Giovanni Domenico","(b. 1708, Carrara, d. 1762, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/olivierx/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, active in Spain. He studied with the Genoese Francisco Maria Schiaffino and showed an early talent for sculpture. Entering the service of the King of Sardinia in Turin, he worked at the Royal Palace there and carried out various works that are documented but untraced."
3648,"OLLIVIER, Michel-Barthélémy","(b. 1712, Marseille, d. 1784, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ollivier/biograph.html,"
French painter. He served his apprenticeship with Carle Van Loo before going to Spain in 1734 with van Loo's nephew, Louis-Michel, who was appointed court painter to King Philip V that year. Ollivier returned to France in 1763 and joined the Académie de St Luc, Paris, where he exhibited a portrait of his wife in 1764. In 1766 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, and he became the official painter of Louis François I, Prince of Conti (1716-76). His four major surviving works were executed for this new patron: Afternoon Tea at the Temple; and Feast Given to the Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg at l'Isle-Adam in 1766, Stag Caught in the Water in front of the Château of l'Isle-Adam and Supper of the Prince of Conti (all Versailles, Château). The first three of these pictures were shown at the Salon of 1777, as was Telemachus and Mentor (untraced)."
3649,"OMMEGANCK, Balthazar Paul","(b. 1755, Antwerpen, d, 1826, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ommeganc/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. At the age of twelve he was placed with the painter Henri Joseph Antonissen (1737-1794), and attended the lectures of the Antwerp Academy, where he gained a prize for a drawing from the antique, and where in 1775 he received another for drawings from the living model, and was specially noticed for his skilful representation of the fur and wool of animals."
3650,"OOST, Jacob van, the Elder","(b. 1603, Brugge, d. 1671, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oost/elder/biograph.html,"
Flemish Baroque painter. The face of painting in seventeenth-century Bruges was shaped by Jacob van Oost the Elder, whose significance is comparable with that of Pieter Pourbus in the previous century. Not surprisingly, his works are liberally sprinkled around the city's convents and churches. Besides altarpieces, Van Oost painted numerous portraits - both of individuals and of families, a genre in which he excelled. The Groeninge Museum in Bruges has samples of both his religious and his secular work, acquired as donations or recovered after the French occupation. Van Oost's large canvas with Saint Augustine, once the altarpiece of Saint Trudo's Abbey, is a case in point. The provincial serenity of the composition, more evident for its organization than its decorative effect, perfectly expresses the temperament of this Bruges painter, whose quiet style contrasts with the virtuoso exuberance of Rubens and the courtly distinction of Van Dyck."
3651,"OOST, Jacob van, the Younger","(b. 1639, Brugge, d. 1713, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oost/younger/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son and pupil of Jacob van Oost the Elder. He settled in Lille, where he continued his father's tradition, albeit in a somewhat more diffuse style, in which suggestive use is made of flakily smeared brushstrokes. His lifelike Portrait of a Man (1697) is a good example of his painting style."
3652,"OOSTEN, Izaac van","(b. 1613, Antwerpen, d. 1661, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oosten/biograph.html,"
Flemish landscape and furniture painter. He became a master in the Antwerp guild of St. Luke in 1652 and painted numerous panels for Antwerp-made furniture. He was heavily influenced by Jan Brueghel the Elder as well as other Flemish contemporaries including Alexander Keirinckx and Lucas van Uden.

3653,"OOSTERWIJK, Maria van","(b. 1630, Nootdorp, d. 1693, Uitdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oosterwi/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter. She was the daughter of a clergyman and is believed to have studied under Jan Davidsz. de Heem whose influence was evident throughout her career.  She achieved considerable attention and acclaim in her own lifetime, counting among her patrons Louis XIV of France and Emperor Leopold I. Her work came to the attention of European royalty of France, Saxony and England. She was monetarily successful, but was, like other women, excluded from membership in the painters guild.



"
3654,"OPIE, John","(b. 1761, St Agnes, d. 1807, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/opie/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was born in a tin-mining district in Cornwall, where his father was a mine carpenter. He was launched in London in 1781 as the 'Cornish Wonder', an untutored natural genius, by John Wolcot, doctor, sometime pupil of Wilson, satirist ('Peter Pindar') and skilful impresario. The young Opie's talent lay in painting peasant types in strong chiaroscuro, and he is best with old people and children, whom he treats with Rembrandtesque effects of light. His large compositions for Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, popular in engravings, were influential in establishing the costume-history piece, but once his Tenebrist vision was smothered by elegant face-painting, he declined into insipidity."
3655,"OPITZ, Georg Emanuel","(b. 1775, Praha, d. 1841, Leipzig)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/opitz/biograph.html,"
Georg Emanuel Opitz (also Opiz), Czech-born German painter. He studied law for a short time before moving to the Academy of Arts in Dresden, where he studied under Giovanni Battista Casanova (1730-1795)."
3656,"OPPENORDT, Alexandre-Jean","(b. 1639, Gelderland, d. 1715, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oppenord/father/biograph.html,"
French cabinetmaker of Dutch origin. Little is known about the life of this artist who moved to France from the Netherlands. He first worked in the area of Paris called the Temple. In this privileged enclave, craftsmen known as ouvriers libres (free workers), who were not yet members of a guild, could practice their craft without being prosecuted. In 1679 he became a naturalized French citizen, and soon afterwards he was awarded lodgings in the palace of the Louvre to work as an ébéniste (cabinetmaker) to Louis XIV. For the royal residences, Oppenordt produced furniture decorated with marquetry of tortoiseshell and brass, as well as pietre dure. He also specialized in parquet floors, producing one for the king's Petit Galerie at the palace of Versailles. His son Gilles-Marie Oppenordt also became a famous designer and architect.

French architect and decorative designer. Oppenordt was the son of the cabinetmaker Alexandre-Jean Oppenordt and pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, and was one of the most charming decorative artists of the 18th century. He was granted an income and went to work in Rome for eight years, where he was influenced by Bernini and Borromini."
3658,"OPSTAL, Gerard van","(b. 1594, Brussel, d. 1668, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/opstal/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor. There is some uncertainty about his birth date and place: he was either born in Brussels in 1594, or in Antwerp in 1604. Opstal trained in Brussels and Antwerp, then moved to Paris around 1642 on the invitation of Cardinal Richelieu. He contributed to many of the new architectural structures built for the king and members of the court. In 1651 was give the title of ""Sculpteur des Bâtiments du Roi"" (Sculptor of the King's Buildings)."

"
3660,"ORDÓÑEZ, Bartolomé","(b. ca. 1490, Burgos, d. 1520, Carrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ordonez/biograph.html,"
The first Spanish sculptor to show clearly the impact of the Italian High Renaissance. On stylistic grounds, he is presumed to have trained in Florence, perhaps with Andrea Sansovino, and in 1514-15 he was in Naples, working with Diego de Siloe on the marble reredos of the Caracciolo Chapel in the church of S. Giovanni a Carbonara. In 1517 he undertook part of the carved decoration for the choir of Barcelona Cathedral, executing in wood and marble a series of reliefs in a pure Renaissance style. There followed a number of contracts for tombs, including that of Charles V's parents, Philip I and Juana of Castile, commissioned by Charles himself for the chapel royal at Granada. Ordóñez died while carrying out these commissions with Italian assistants at Carrara; but his testament records that he had completed the greater part of the work, including most of the royal tomb. Although he died young (he was perhaps born c. 1490), his elegant and imaginative style was highly influential.

Bernard (or Bernaert or Barend) van Orley, Netherlandish painter of religious subjects and portraits and designer of tapestries and stained glass. He was the leading artist of his day in Brussels, becoming court painter to Margaret of Austria, regent of the Netherlands, in 1518 and to her successor Mary of Hungary in 1532. His work is characterized by the use of ill-digested Italianate motifs. There is no evidence that he visited Italy, and his knowledge presumably came from engravings and from Raphael's tapestry cartoons, which were in Brussels c.1516-19; he has (very flatteringly) been called 'the Raphael of the Netherlands'.  In 1520, when Dürer visited the Netherlands, Orley gave a banquet for him, and Dürer drew his portrait."

Spanish painter. In his youth he was a friend of El Greco's son, but his art holds closely to the course set by Bassano and Ribalta. Chiaroscuro is the principal element of his style, particularly in the paintings of his maturity. For the greater part of his life Orrente lived in Valencia and, in fact, became a member of the Valencian school. He painted numerous Biblical scenes in which the landscapes have a certain importance. These are dominated by the brownish and reddish tones popularized by Ribalta.

Italian painter and draughtsman. A prominent Emilian artist of the mid-16th century, he was influenced by Correggio as well as by the late Mannerist style of Giulio Romano. His large-scale works seem to have been mainly secular decorations, notably illusionistic façades, of which only fragments are extant. Their energy and expressiveness are apparent, however, in the surviving paintings of smaller dimensions. Orsi's sole documented architectural work is the Collegiata di S Stefano, Novellara (1567; study, Windsor Castle, Royal Library)."

The dynasty was founded by Jan van Os and included his sons Pieter Gerardus van Os, painter and etcher, and Georgius van Os, painter, his daughter, the fruit and flower painter Maria Margaretha van Os (1780-1862), and his grandson, the painter of landscapes with horses and cattle Pieter Frederik van Os (1808-1892)."
3674,"OS, Pieter Gerardus van","(b. 1776, Den Haag, d. 1839, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/os/pieter/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher, part of a family of painters, son of Jan van Os. He studied with his father and from 1794 to 1795 at the Tekenakademie in The Hague. During this period he copied paintings from the collection of Willem V, including Paulus Potter's Young Bull (1647; The Hague, Mauritshuis). After completing his training, he departed for Amsterdam, where he supported himself primarily by painting rather mediocre portrait miniatures and giving drawing lessons."
3675,"OSONA, Francisco de","(b. ca. 1465, Valencia, d. ca. 1514, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/osona/francisc/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active in Valencia. He was the son of Rodrigo de Osona the Elder (c. 1440-c. 1518), one of the leading masters of his day in Valencia, introducing both Netherlandish and Italian Renaissance to the area. Very little is known about his life. Only one document has survived which mentions him along with his father."
3676,"OSONA, Rodrigo de, the Younger",(active 1505-1530 in Valencia),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/osona/rodrigo2/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active in Valencia. He was the son of Rodrigo de Osona the Elder (c. 1440-c. 1518), one of the leading masters of his day in Valencia, introducing both Netherlandish and Italian Renaissance to the area. The son continued his father's style in a weaker, more Italianate style. His brother Francisco de Osona (c. 1465-c. 1514) was also painter.

3677,"OSTADE, Adriaen Jansz. van","(b. 1610, Haarlem, d. 1685, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ostade/adriaen/biograph.html,"

Dutch painter and printmaker of the Baroque period known for his genre pictures of Dutch peasant life. He also did religious subjects, portraits, and landscapes. Van Ostade was a prolific artist, executing his small-scale works in oil, usually on wood panels. He also worked in watercolour, did spirited pen drawings, and produced about 50 etchings. His works won him much popularity during his lifetime, and in 1662 he was made president of the Haarlem painters' guild.

"
3678,"OSTADE, Isaack van","(b. 1621, Haarlem, d. 1649, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ostade/isaack/biograph.html,"

Dutch genre and landscape painter of the Baroque period, especially noted for his winter scenes and depictions of peasants and travelers at rustic inns.

"
3679,"OSTENDORFER, Michael",(c. 1494-1559),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ostendor/biograph.html,"
German painter, draughtsman and woodcut designer. He was first mentioned as a master and citizen of Regensburg in 1520. At about the same time he produced his earliest surviving work, including two large woodcuts, The Pilgrimage to the Church of the Beautiful Virgin of Regensburg, and the New Church of the Beautiful Virgin. These establish an association with Altdorfer who clearly exercised a strong influence on him from the beginning, and who may have trained him. The former woodcut outstandingly illustrates the sort of religious hysteria that Luther among others was to decry, prompted by reports of hundreds of miracles happening at a church built on the site of a synagogue after the expulsion of Jews from Regensburg in 1619."
3680,"OTTIN, Auguste","(b. 1811, Paris, d. 1890, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ottin/biograph.html,"

3681,"OTTONI, Lorenzo","(b. 1658, Roma, d. 1736, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ottoni/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He trained with Antonio Giorgetti and later with Ercole Ferrata, probably remaining in the latter's workshop as an assistant. Working mainly in marble, Ottoni's earliest commissions date from the 1670s, and an over life-size bust of Urban VIII in the main square at Pesaro, ordered by Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was completed by 1684 under the auspices of Francesco's brother Cardinal Carlo Barberini. Carlo engaged the sculptor to execute the monument to Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1682) in St Peter's in Rome. Carlo also commissioned several portrait sculptures of members of the Barberini family from Ottoni during the 1680s.



"
3682,"OUDINÉ, Eugène André","(b. 1810, Paris, d. 1887, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oudine/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and engraver of medals. He devoted himself from the beginning to the medallist's branch of sculpture, although he also excelled in monumental sculpture and portrait busts. He may be considered the father of the modern medal."
3683,"OUDRY, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1686, Paris, d. 1755, Beauvais)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oudry/father/biograph.html,"French painter, tapestry designer, and illustrator. He was a pupil of Largillière and painted some portraits, but he is renowned chiefly as one of the outstanding animal painters of the 18th century. With Desportes he was the foremost exponent of hunting scenes and still-life with dead game. Some of his best work was done as a tapestry designer, and he was head of the Beauvais and Gobelins factories from 1734 and 1736 respectively. He also did book illustrations, notably for an edition of La Fontaine's Fables (1755). His son Jacques-Charles, a flower and animal painter, sometimes collaborated with him.



"
3684,"OUDRY, Jacques-Charles","(b. ca. 1722, Paris, d. 1778, Lausanne)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/oudry/son/biograph.html,"
French painter, son of Jean-Baptiste Oudry. He trained and worked with his father. His best work closely resembles that of his father in subject matter and style, although his draughtsmanship is weaker and his animal anatomy is often poor."
3685,"OUTIN, Pierre","(b. 1840, Moulins, d. 1899, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/outin/biograph.html,"
French painter. Like many aspiring artists, Outin travelled to Paris where he trained under the landscape and figurative painter Charles Joseph Lecointe (1824-1886) from whom he gained a strong understanding for landscape painting as well as elements of the Orient. He was also a pupil of the classical and historical painter Alexandre Cabanel whose academic style, historical subjects and fine drawing was to provide the strong grounding for Outin's highly successful career; this was confirmed when he made his debut at the Paris Salon in 1868."
3686,"OUVRIER, Jean","(b. 1725, Paris, d. 1784, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ouvrier/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He made engravings after the works by Boucher, Falconet, Claude-Joseph Vernet, and others. He was the teacher of Benoît-Louis Prévost (1747-c. 1804)."
3687,"OUWATER, Albert van",(active mid-15th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ouwater/albert/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. Only one documentary reference to him is known (it refers to the burial of his daughter in 1467) but recently it turned out to be a misreading. Otherwise knowledge depends on what van Mander wrote about him c. 1604. He said Ouwater was the founder of the Haarlem school and the master of Geertgen tot Sint Jans. He also praised his skill as a landscapist, so it is ironic that the only painting that can be identified as Ouwater's from van Mander's description of his work is an interior scene - the Raising of Lazarus (Staatliche Museen, Berlin). The thoughtful, unemotional style has some affinities with the work of Dieric Bouts the Elder who was a native of Haarlem. He may have designed for the new craft of woodcut book-illustration. A fragmentary Head of a Donor (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and two wings in Granada are attributed to him.



"
3688,"OUWATER, Isaak","(b. 1750, Amsterdam, d. 1793, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ouwater/isaak/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He worked in the tradition of the topographical town portrait, which originated in the northern Netherlands in the late 17th century, and he was greatly inspired by the work of Jan van der Heyden. Although he lived in Amsterdam for the greater part of his life, Ouwater travelled all over the country, making sketches that he used as a basis for his oil paintings. His itinerary can be traced from his dated works. In 1782 he stayed in Haarlem, where his paintings included the Grote Markt (Haarlem, Frans Halsmuseum); that same year he painted the Buitenhof in The Hague (The Hague, Gemeentemuseum), and in 1784 he apparently worked in Hoorn, where he produced sketches for two topographical pictures, now in the Westfries Museum there. He also made sketches of street scenes for later paintings, in Utrecht, Edam and Delft."
3689,"OVENS, Jürgen","(b. 1623, Tönning, d. 1678, Friedrichstadt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/ovens/biograph.html,"
Jürgen (Jurriaen) Ovens, German portrait painter from North Frisia. According to Arnold Houbraken, he was a a pupil of Rembrandt, but research since has proven that theory to be false. He is best known for his painting in the city hall of Amsterdam and paintings for the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp for whom he worked for more than 30 years, also as an art dealer."
3690,"OVERBECK, Friedrich","(b. 1789, Lübeck, d. 1869, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/overbeck/biograph.html,"
German painter, the leading member of the Nazarenes. He moved to Rome in 1810 and was based there for the rest of his life, although he made several visits to Germany. In 1813 he was converted to Roman Catholicism and apart from a few portraits (there is a self-portrait in the Uffizi) his work was almost exclusively on religious themes. He painted in a consciously archaic style - clear and sincere but rather pallid - based on the work of Perugino and the young Raphael. The Rose Miracle of St Francis (Portiuncula Chapel, Assisi, 1829) is perhaps his best-known painting. The high-minded and didactic tone of his work won it a more sympathetic acceptance (particularly in England) than its artistic quality alone merited. William Dyce and Ford Madox Brown were among his supporters and there were affinities between his aspirations and those of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.



"
3691,"OVERBEKE, Adriaen van",(active 1508-1529 in Antwerp),https://www.wga.hu/bio/o/overbeke/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was registered as a painter in the Guild of St Luke, Antwerp, in 1508 and accepted two apprentices in 1522. His known activity is restricted to the production and supply of carved and polychrome wooden altarpieces with painted shutters. In Antwerp carved altarpieces seem to have been produced by painters and carvers working within one workshop, which was possible since both belonged to the same guild. Van Overbeke may have run such a workshop."
3692,"PAÁL, László","(b. 1846, Zám, d. 1879, Charenton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paal/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter, an outstanding figure of Hungarian realist landscape painting. Mihály Munkácsy convinced him  to take up painting, and in 1864 Paál enrolled in the Academy in Vienna. His trip to Holland in 1870 had a major impact on his career: the  example of Dutch landscape painting liberated his propensity for colours. In 1872 be travelled to France and settled in Barbizon."
3693,"PACE DEL CAMPIDOGLIO, Michele","(b. ca. 1610, Roma, d. ca. 1670, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pace/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Michelangelo di Campidoglio. The only certain information on him relates to paintings for Cardinal Flavio Chigi, documented from 1658 to 1660, and to his presence at meetings of the Accademia di S Luca in 1667 and 1668. "
3694,PACECCO,"(b. 1607, Napoli, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacecco/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the son of the painter Tommaso de Rosa. His first teacher was his stepfather, the Caravaggesque painter Filippo Vitale, with whom he was associated until Vitale's death in 1650. He had two sisters, Maria Grazia de Rosa, and Diana or Annella de Rosa. Pacecco continued his studies under Massimo Stanzione, whose elegant classicism was of fundamental importance to the development of his art, and he was one of Stanzione's most gifted pupils. The naturalism of Vitale dominates his earliest works (1625-30), such as the Virgin and Child (Naples, Santa Marta) and the Virgin of Purity (Naples, Santa Maria del Divino Amore). Vitale's influence is also shown in the Deposition (now in the Museum of the Certosa di San Martino). Also in the Certosa is a St Nicholas of Bari and Basilius (1636), showing influences of both Stanzione and Domenichino, who was in Naples from 1631."
3695,"PACETTI, Vincenzo","(b. 1746, Castel Bolognese, d. 1820, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacetti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and restorer, particularly active in collecting and restoring classical sculptures such as the Barberini Faun (1799, Glyptothek, Munich), the Hope Dionysus (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and the Athena of Velletri (1797, Musée du Louvre, Paris) and selling them to rich collectors as finished artefacts. He was the brother of Camillo Pacetti, also sculptor."
3696,"PACHECO, Francisco","(b. 1564, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, d. 1644, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacheco/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, teacher, and scholar, active in Seville. Although an undistinguished artist himself, he is remembered as the teacher of both Diego Velázquez and Alonso Cano and as the author of Arte de la pintura (1649), a treatise on the art of painting that is the most important document for the study of 17th-century Spanish art."
3697,"PACHER, Michael","(b. ca. 1435, Bruneck, d. 1498, Salzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacher/biograph.html,"
Tyrolean Painter and sculptor. He died at Salzburg, but most of his career was spent at Bruneck in the Tyrol. Nothing is known of his training, and the earliest recorded work by him (a signed and dated altarpiece of 1465) is now lost. He worked mainly for local churches, carrying out the carving as well as the painting of his altarpieces, and much of his work is still in situ. His most celebrated work is the St Wolfgang altarpiece (1471-81) in the church of St Wolfgang on the Abersee, a huge polyptych with some astonishingly intricate woodcarving.

"
3698,"PACHER, Friedrich",(active 1470-80 in Tyrol),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacher_f/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. Although he may initially have assisted Michael Pacher in his workshop in Bruneck, their kinship remains unproven. He was entrusted with parochial and judicial duties in Bruneck, which indicates his own successful career."
3699,PACINO DI BONAGUIDA,(active 1302-1340 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pacino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and illuminator. In 1303, when he dissolved a partnership with the painter Tambo di Serraglio begun the previous year, Pacino was described as 'publicus artifex in arte pictorum'. The polyptych of the Crucifixion with Sts Nicholas, Bartholomew, Florentius and Luke (Florence, Academy), which bears the now incomplete inscription SIMON PRESBYTER S. FLORENTII FECIT PINGI HOC OPUS A PACINO BONAGUIDE ANNO DOMINI MCCCX and which originally stood on the high altar of San Firenze, Florence, is his only signed work; it is painted in an archaic style related to the traditions of the late 13th century with an additional influence from Giotto's early works. After examining many paintings, one scholar in the 1930s rescued Pacino from obscurity; based on close similarities in style, he attributed many paintings to Pacino."
3700,"PACKH, János","(b. 1796, Eisenstadt, d. 1839, Esztergom)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/packh/biograph.html,"
Hungarian Neoclassical architect, trained in Vienna. He assisted his uncle, Paul von Kühnel (d. 1824), in the design and erection of the monumental Cathedral of St Adalbert, Esztergom. Packh was responsible for the crypt (1823), and after his uncle's death he took over as sole architect to oversee the building of the greatest architectural project within the Habsburg domains at the time. The Cathedral was completed (1840-56) by József Hild, and has a vast polychrome dome and a huge portico."

3703,"PAELINCK, Joseph","(b. 1781, Oostakker, d. 1839, Ixelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paelinck/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The son of a farmer, he studied at the Academie in Ghent. He exhibited for the first time in 1802 at the Ghent Salon, then left for Paris where he was admitted into Jacques-Louis David's studio. In 1804 his Judgement of Paris (Ghent, Museum voor Schone Kunsten) obtained a prize at the Ghent Salon. The first of numerous commissions that followed was for St Colette (1806; Ghent, St Baaf), which was in keeping with the contemporary Historicist vogue. In 1808 he was commissioned to paint a portrait of the Empress Josephine (Ghent, Museum voor Schone Kunsten), and in the same year the town of Ghent granted him an allowance for four years of study in Rome where, with other former pupils of David, he took part in the decoration of the Palazzo del Quirinale; his contribution, Augustus Ordering the Adornment of Rome, is untraced. While in Italy he also painted a Neoclassical Invention of the Cross (1812; Ghent, St Michel), inspired by Raphael."

3707,"PAJOU, Augustin","(b. 1730, Paris, d. 1809, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pajou/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, who was a pupil of Jean-Baptist Lemoyne and studied in Rome 1752-56. He is best known for his decorative sculpture in the Opera House at Versailles (1768-70)  and for his numerous portraits - Lemoyne (1758) and Buffon in the Louvre, Descartes and Bossuet in the Institut. He worked much for Mme du Barry. In 1777 he was appointed Keeper of the King's Antiquities and in 1792 he served on a Revolutionary Committee on the Conservation of Works of Art. His Psyche Abandoned (1791, Louvre) is a piece of Neoclassical sentiment.

Italian painter, daughter and student of Filippo di Lorenzo Paladini. She was educated in the monastery of Sant'Agata in Florence, and was not just a painter; she was also a singer and a tapestry expert. From a young age she enjoyed the protection of the Medici Grand Duchesses, Christina of Lorraine and then Maria Maddalena of Austria, which aided her artistic training. She studied painting with Jacopo Ligozzi and singing with Francesca Caccini, performing before the court of the grand duchy in the church of Santa Felicita and in Palazzo Pitti."

Italian painter and sculptor, sometimes confused with the painter Filippo di Benedetto Paladini (1544-1614). He is best remembered for having completed in 1585 the frieze on the façade of the Ospedale del Ceppo in Pistoia, with the scene Giving Drink to the Thirsty, in painted stucco (not knowing the technique of polychrome glazed terracotta)."
3710,"PALAGI, Pelagio","(b. 1775/77, Bologna, d. 1860, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palagi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, architect, designer and collector. At the age of 12 he began to frequent the house in Bologna of his patron Conte Carlo Filippo Aldrovandi Marescotti (1763-1823), whose collections and library provided his early artistic education and engendered his taste for collecting. From 1795 he worked on several decorative schemes with the theatre designer and decorator Antonio Basoli (1774-1848), and it was perhaps in theatre designs that Palagi was first exposed to an eclectic range of motifs from exotic cultures. He was influenced by the linear, mannered style of Felice Giani, with whom he frequented the important evening drawing sessions at the house of the engraver Francesco Rosaspina (1762-1841)."
3711,"PALAMEDESZ., Antonie","(b. 1601, Delft, d. 1673, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palamede/anthonie/biograph.html,"
Dutch portrait and genre painter, active mainly in his native Delft. He was a pupil of Miereveld and Dirk Hals and his paintings resemble those of his masters - his portraits rather wooden, his 'merry company' groups of soldiers, cavaliers,and their ladies livelier and pleasantly coloured. His younger brother Palamedes I Palamedesz. and his nephew Palamedes II Palamedesz. (1633-1705) were both painters.

3713,"PALISSY, Bernard","(b. 1510, Agen, d. 1590, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palissy/biograph.html,"
French glass painter and potter. He probably grew up in Gascony. He settled in Saintes in 1539 or 1540, after a decade of travelling all over France and neighbouring regions working as a peintre-vitrier (one who paints, assembles and installs stained-glass windows) and probably also as a surveyor. During the first decade of his time in Saintes he worked as a surveyor, glass painter and possibly as a portrait painter. In connection with the tax for the salt industry, he received a prestigious royal commission to survey and map the salt marshes of the Saintonge between May 1543 and May or June 1544. His real interest, however, was concentrated on the search for the means of making a white tin glaze such as one embellishing a cup that he had admired during his travels. This change in the direction of his artistic interests occurred when he first settled in Saintes, possibly in the house of Antoine de Pons, the King's Lieutenant in the Saintonge, and Palissy's lifelong friend and patron."
3714,"PALIZZI, Filippo","(b. 1818, Vasto, d. 1899, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palizzi/filippo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, considered one of the most representative artists of the realist school of Naples. He embarked on legal studies but left these to attend the Reale Istituto di Belle Arti in Naples from 1836 as an external student of landscape painting under Anton Sminck Pitloo (1791-1837). After Pitloo's death, he studied under Gabriele Smargiassi (1798-1882), whose academic and dogmatic approach he adopted in his own work, along with the fundamentally Romantic spirit informing it. Early works include the Evening Angelus (1838; Vasto, Pinacoteca Civica) and the paintings exhibited in several of the Bourbon Esposizioni Biennali in Naples. Their melancholic mood was a common element in Italian historical landscape painting from the mid-1820s onwards, and it had been inspired by the landscapes of Massimo Tapparelli d'Azeglio. Palizzi was among the first to introduce it to Naples. In 1841 Palizzi exhibited several historical landscapes at the Reale Museo Borbonico."
3715,"PALIZZI, Giuseppe","(b. 1812, Lanciano, d. 1888, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palizzi/giuseppe/biograph.html,"

Italian architect. While a young mason, he was noticed by an Italian scholar and soon found himself studying mathematics, music, philosophy, and Classical authors. He was trained as an architect in Vicenza, and later in Rome he examined the remains of Roman architecture. The measured drawings he made of these were published with compositions of his own and, based on the treatise of Vitruvius, a description of practical systems of design and proportioning. This famous work, I quattro libri dell'architectura (1570, tr. The Four Books of Architecture, 1716), has been reissued many times. It was possibly the most influential architectural pattern book ever printed."
3717,"PALMA, Antonio","(b. 1515, Serina, d. after 1574, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palma/antonio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, nephew of Palma Vecchio. He was apprenticed to Bonifacio Veronese (Bonifazio de' Pitati), whose niece Giulia he married c. 1545. He probably assisted Bonifazio in the decoration of the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi, Venice, and the sacristy of San Sebastiano, Venice. A signed Pietà (S Annunziata, Serina), a processional banner dated 1565, is too damaged to be indicative of his style. One other signed work, the Resurrection (Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart), forms the basis for gathering a small number of stylistically similar works under Antonio's name. The remainder of what must have been a substantial oeuvre is submerged in the proliferation of painting influenced by Bonifacio in the mid-16th century. A late painting, Esther and Ahasuerus (1574; Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota), testifies to the longevity of the style of Bonifacio. Titian's Portrait of a Man with a Palm (1561; Gemäldegalerie, Dresden) is generally thought to represent Antonio Palma.

He is said to have been a pupil of Titian, but this tradition has been doubted (it is probably based on the fact that he completed the Pietà which Titian left incomplete at his death). In the late 1560s and early 1570s he worked in central Italy, mainly Rome, but thereafter he spent the rest of his life in Venice, and after the death of Tintoretto in 1594 he was the leading painter in the city.

3719,PALMA VECCHIO,"(b. 1480, Serina, d. 1528, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palma/vecchio/biograph.html,"Palma Vecchio (Jacopo Palma) (c.1480-1528). Italian painter. born near Bergamo, but active for all his known career in Venice, where he is first documented in 1510. His original name was Jacopo d'Antonio Negretti, but he was using the name Palma by 1513. He is called Palma Vecchio (Old Palma) to distinguish him from Palma Giovane (Young Palma), his great-nephew. Nothing is known of his training, and there is indeed very little secure knowledge about his life and works, none of his pictures being dated or reliably signed and very few of them being certainly identifiable from early sources. His style is distinctive, however, and in practice the definition of his oeuvre is much less problematic than with many of his contemporaries.

3720,"PALMER, Samuel","(b. 1805, Newington, d. 1881, Redhill)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palmer/biograph.html,"
English landscape painter and etcher. He showed a precocious talent and exhibited landscape drawings at the Royal Academy when he was 14. In 1822 he met Linnell, who introduced him to William Blake in 1824. Palmer had had visionary experiences from childhood and the effect of Blake upon him was to intensify an inherent mystical bent."
3721,PALMERINO DI GUIDO,(active c. 1296-c. 1309),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palmerin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Assisi. He was a collaborator of Giotto on the Legend of St Francis in the Upper Church of San Francesco, and executed many of the paintings in the St Nicholas Chapel of the Lower Church."
3722,"PALMEZZANO, Marco","(b. ca. 1459, Forlí, d. ca. 1539, Forlí)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/palmezza/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His earliest work was probably on the fresco decoration (c. 1480-84) of the vault of the sacristy of the treasury in the Santa Casa, Loreto, designed by Melozzo da Forlí. He then probably went to Rome, where he may have painted the fresco in the apse of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. In 1493 Palmezzano is documented working with Melozzo on the fresco decoration in the Feo Chapel, S Biagio (destroyed 1944), Forlí. Melozzo's influence - with a few references, also, to Venetian art - continues to be seen in his works of the 1490s. A document dated 30 May 1495, relating to the division of property between Marco and his two brothers, endows the painter with a house in Venice and all its furnishings. This suggests his presence there around that time, and the figure of St Sebastian in the altarpiece depicting St Anthony Abbot and Other Saints (Forlí, Pinacoteca Civica) clearly shows the painter's familiarity with Giovanni Bellini's S Giobbe altarpiece (c. 1480; Venice, Accademia). In this work, however, one can already see a certain weakening of Palmezzano's inventive powers, which perhaps is what led him to experiment with all the artistic trends of the time. His desire to keep up to date increased as his work became more successful in the Romagna and along the Adriatic coast."

He was born of good family and studied philosophy, theology and law in Cordoba, receiving also lessons in painting from Valdes Leal, who visited Córdoba in 1672, and afterwards from Alfaro (1675). He moved to Madrid in 1678 and married soon afterwards. In 1688 he was appointed painter to the king. He visited Valencia in 1697, and remained there three or four years devoting himself to fresco painting. Between 1705 and 1715 he resided for considerable periods at Salamanca, Granada and Córdoba. After the death of his wife in 1725 Palomino took priests orders."
3725,"PALUDANUS, Guillielmus","(b. 1530, Mechelen, d. 1579, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paludanu/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, known also as Willem van den Broeck. He began his training in his native town and continued it on a subsequent journey to Italy. In 1557 he was admitted as a master to the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp, where he became a citizen in 1559. He is documented in 1566-7 as receiving payment for three statues for Antwerp Cathedral. In 1571 he executed a base for the life-size bronze statue (destroyed 1577) of Don Fernando Alvárez de Toledo, Duque de Alba, in the citadel of Antwerp. He seems also to have been in demand with foreign patrons. Possibly through the mediation of his friend Abraham de Hel (1534-98), a painter from Antwerp residing in Augsburg, he was commissioned in 1560 to produce five alabaster reliefs, showing scenes from the Old and New Testaments, for an altar in the Dominikanerkirche, Augsburg (now Römishe Museum). An alabaster relief of the Crucifixion (1560), signed G. P. F. (Guilelgmus Paludanus fecit), is in the collections of the Maximilianmuseum, Augsburg. He produced in Antwerp other sculptures in marble and alabaster for export, including relief panels (c. 1563) for the palace chapel in Schwerin of the dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and three chancel screens (1571; destroyed), sent to Spain."

Italian gem carver, active in Prague. The Castrucci workshop in Prague was founded by Emperor Rudolf II, who was a fervent admirer of the new technique of commesso di pietre dure (Florentine mosaic). In Italy this technique of assembling pictures from cut gemstones was revived to perfection at the end of the 16th century. The first head of the Prague workshop was Cosimo Castrucci."

Italian painter. He was the son of Gasparo de Pannetis of Ferrara and was probably taught by Bona da Ferrara. While still young he painted a Virgin Enthroned and the Infant Jesus, in the sacristy of Ferrara cathedral. He is known to have executed in 1503 a St Joseph, and the Virgin and Child between two Saints. In 1509 he executed the frescoes in the San Maurelio chapel at San Giorgio Extra Muros (beyond the walls) in Ferrara. He painted a processional banner in 1511 for the 'congregazione della morte' in Ferrara. Vasari says he was the master of Garofalo (Benvenuto Tisi).

He was the first painter to specialize in ruins, treating them as Roman 'vedute' of a special kind. He was working in Rome by c. 1717, but the earliest surviving dated picture is of 1727 (London, Wellington Museum); in 1729 he was concerned in a Fête given by Cardinal de Polignac in honour of the birth of the Dauphin and this began a long connection with France and the French Academy in Rome. Paintings of the Fête are in the Louvre (1729) and Dublin (1731). His views of modern Rome, as well as his capricci based on the better-known ruins, had an enormous vogue among Grand Tourists and examples are to be found in most older galleries. Piranesi, though far more of an archaeologist, was influenced by him, and so was Canaletto.

3732,"PANTOJA DE LA CRUZ, Juan","(b. 1553, Valladolid, d. 1608, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pantoja/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, pupil and successor of Sanchez Coello, becoming court painter to Philip III in 1596. His official portraits are flat and hieratic, but his religious works show the influence of Italian Caravaggismo. There are works in the Escorial and Madrid and in several other museums. He also painted the retable for the monastery church of St Augustine, Valladolid.



"
3733,"PAOLINI, Pietro","(b. 1603, Lucca, d. 1681, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paolini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the son of Tommaso Paolini and Ginevra Raffaelli, both from Lucca. In 1619 Paolini's father sent him to study under Angelo Caroselli in Rome. His artistic formation was also influenced by the circle of Italian and, especially, northern European followers of Bartolomeo Manfredi, who were active in Rome between 1620 and 1630. The following works, though undocumented, may be dated to this Roman period: Martha and Mary Magdalene (Rome, Galeria Pallavicini), the Concert of Female Musicians (Malibu, Getty Museum) and the Bacchic Concert (private collection). Paolini's first religious works, such as the Deposition (Lucca, S Frediano), as well as many portraits, also show signs of Roman influence. Around 1628 he went to Venice, where he stayed for two years. The effects of this visit can be seen in his later religious works, such as the Virgin and Saints (Rome, Palazzo Barberini) and the Virgin and Saints (Lucca, Villa Guinigi), and also in his history paintings, such as Esther and Ahasuerus (Denver, Art Museum)."

Italian painter (originally Paolo di Bernardino del Signoraccio). He was the son of Bernardino del Signoraccio, a minor Pistoian painter. In 1503, he entered the Dominican order in the convent of San Domenico in Pistoia which was very close to the ideas of Savonarola. In 1509 he moved to Florence and entered the studio of San Marco, then directed by Fra Bartolomeo. He is recorded in 1513 as a monk of the Dominican convent of San Marco in Florence. In that year he made two clay statues of St Dominic and St Mary Magdalene (both untraced) that in 1516 were placed in Santa Maria Maddalena in Pian di Mugnone."

He held public positions in Siena from 1369 and was first mentioned in the register of painters enrolled in the Breve dall'Arte in 1389. There are a number of signed and dated works from 1381 onwards. Between 1395 and 1410 he is documented as working at Siena Cathedral. Works such as the Birth of the Virgin (Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale) and the Assumption of the Virgin (Washington, National Gallery of Art) show the influence of the Lorenzetti brothers, Pietro and Ambrogio, Bartolo di Fredi and Simone Martini. Paolo di Giovanni Fei's figures have a slightly jowly, long-cheeked and long-nosed facial type and hands with characteristically bulbous ended fingers."

Italian late Gothic painter from Visso, in the Italian region Marche. Active between 1437 and 1481, he is the most important artistic personality of the territory. Several works by him are known scattered in Marche and Umbria, but only one bears his signature, the Madonna Enthroned with the Child,  made for the church Santa Maria dell'Oro a Terni (now in the Musée du Petit Palais, Avignon)."

According to one source, Pareja was orphaned at age five when his mother died, and was taken in by his master's mistress. Juan lived with her for many years. Her nephew, Diego Velázquez, inherited Juan following his aunt's death. Other sources say Juan de Pareja was not a slave but a servant to Diego Velázquez."

Bernardino Parenzano (Parentino), Italian painter of Istrian origin with is highly unusual style. Active in Mantua and Padua (though he cannot be identified with the monk and prophet of the same name [1437-1531], as was once thought), his work reveals the influence of Mantegna together with some elements drawn from Ferrarese painting. He had a period in Venice. In 1496 he was appointed to the Gonzaga Courtin Mantua (including the decoration of the Studiolo of Isabella d'Este)."
3743,"PARET Y ALCAZÁR, Luis","(b. 1746, Madrid, d. 1799, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paret/biograph.html,"

He trained in Madrid, first with the French jeweller Augustin Duflos (fl. 1722-67) and then with the Trinitarian friar Bartolomé de San Antonio (1708-82), uncle of the architect Ventura Rodríguez. Paret studied for four years at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de S Fernando and with the patronage of the Infante Luis Antonio Bourbon, the brother of Charles III, went to Rome in 1763, where he completed his artistic training. On his return to Madrid in 1766, he won prizes at the Academia and probably travelled to France or studied contemporary French art under the guidance of Charles de La Traverse, who was a former pupil of François Boucher and who was in Madrid at that time."

After the latter's death in 1635, he became court architect of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany at Palazzo Pitti where he led the completion of the Giardini di Boboli, building the Isolotto and the steps of the amphitheatre. He also worked in the church of San Giovannino degli Scolopi, the basilica of Santo Spirito, and the Medici villas at Poggio a Caiano and Careggi.

Italian painter, part of a family of artists, son of Filippo Parodi. Around 1678 he accompanied the family to Venice, where he studied with the portraitist Sebastiano Bombelli. He was in Padua around 1685 and later travelled to Rome to work under Maratti, possibly in 1690-94 when Paolo Girolamo Piola was there. Parodi's Jupiter Rescuing a Shipwreck (before 1694, untraced; known from engraving), a complex composition that includes many figures in motion, demonstrates that in the 1690s he was Piola's equal in combining the current highly ornamental figure-style (promoted by Piola's workshop, the Casa Piola) with a classical manner inspired by Roman trends. This ability is apparent in his earliest dated works, two oval paintings depicting David Lamenting the Death of Uzza and Christ Driving the Money-changers from the Temple (both 1700; Rome, Santa Maria in Vallicella)."
3750,"PARODI, Filippo","(b. 1630, Genova, d. 1702, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/parodi/filippo/biograph.html,"

Italian sculptor and wood-carver, part of a family of artists. Filippo first worked as a wood-carver and went to Rome twice, staying for six years each time. The time Parodi spent in Rome is vital for the understanding of the stylistic characteristics of his work. The crowning of the pediment of the altar of the Virgin in Santa Maria delle Vigne, Genoa, with allegorical figures of Faith, Hope and Charity follows a composition that occurs frequently in Roman churches, and four statues representing characters from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Narcissus, Hyacinth, Heliantha and Flora, all Genoa, Palazzo Reale) reveal a thorough knowledge of Roman Baroque sculpture. These works, and a large carved wooden looking-glass in the Villa Durazzo at Albisola, Genoa, probably date not much later than 1661."

In Genoa, his frescoes are in the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena. He painted church ceilings in Milan, contributed to the decoration of churches in Bergamo and to the Palazzo Mazzoleni in Bibbiena. In Rome, his sole prominent public commission was for the fresco of the ceiling of San Pietro in Vincoli in 1706 and the vault medallions (c. 1706) in Santa Maria dell'Orto.

Returning to France, he moved about between Languedoc, Provence and the Venaissin, leaving evidence of his talent in all these places. He was married for the first time in Avignon in 1690 to Marie Anne de Seisson. His second wife, whom he married in 1695, was Marie Magdeleine de Pallas by whom he had eight children. Two of them, Pierre Ignace (1702-1775) and Joseph François (1704-1781), were to be artists. Pierre was recognised by the Académie Royale as a history painter in 1730 but never became a member."

English painter. He first established himself in London as a portrait painter, exhibiting at the Society of Artists in 1760 and at the Free Society of Artists from 1761. In 1764 he won the third premium of the Royal Society of Arts for his history painting depicting Caractacus before the Emperor Claudius (untraced). In the same year he was selected by the Dilettanti Society to accompany Richard Chandler and Nicholas Revett on an archaeological expedition to Asia Minor and Greece (1764-66). His views of Classical monuments in Asia Minor were engraved and published in Ionian Antiquities (1769), while those he made in Greece, which included pioneering drawings of the Parthenon sculptures, were used in the second volume of James Stuart's Antiquities of Athens (1777). In 1769 seven of the crisp, coolly lit watercolour originals (London, British Museum) with their lively figures (probably influenced by Stuart's own gouache drawings) were exhibited at the Royal Academy; Pars was elected Associate of the Royal Academy the following year.

After one term he returned to Stockholm and began his artistic training in his father's studio. In 1752 he went to Copenhagen to study under Carl Gustaf Pilo, Jacques-François-Joseph Saly and Johann Martin Preisler at the Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi. He won a second-place medal and was promised a travel scholarship from Sweden. This did not materialize, but nevertheless he travelled in 1757 to Paris, where, on recommendation from Alexander Roslin, he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts with Roslin, Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Pierre and Louis-Michel van Loo as teachers.

Italian painter. He trained with Guido Reni's most gifted pupil, Simone Cantarini. As his assistant he absorbed Cantarini's taste for delicately inflected figural poses, for an unusually nuanced palette and for a reflective rather than dramatic interpretation of both religious and secular subjects. After Cantarini's sudden death in Verona in 1648 Pasinelli worked, briefly and unsatisfactorily, with another Cantarini pupil, Flaminio Torri, and there remain problems of attribution over the pictures of this period.

Given the similarities in style, he was apparently the pupil or assistant of Cima da Conegliano, but he was not employed in his workshop to execute the master's designs. Only two dated works by the artist are known to us, the Madonna and Child with Saint Mary Magdalene of 1496 in the Museo Correr, Venice, and the Madonna and Child with St John the Baptist of 1502 now in a private collection."
3760,"PASQUETTI, Fortunato","(b. ca. 1690, Venezia, d. 1773, Portogruaro)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pasquett/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. A pupil of Niccolò Cassana, he distinguished himself as a portrait painter, receiving many commissions from wealthy patricians of eighteenth-century Venice. His first known work, depicting St Jerome, was until 1733 in the church of San Simeone Profeta (now untraced). He was praised by his contemporaries for his well-designed portraits."
3761,PASQUINO DA MONTEPULCIANO,"(b. ca. 1425, Montepulciano, d. 1485, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pasquino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and bronze caster. His date of birth is calculated from the catasto (land registry declaration) returns of 1457 and 1480 (that of 1470 erroneously implies that he was born in 1428). In August 1435 he matriculated into the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e di Legname. In 1445 he collaborated with Antonio Filarete on the bronze doors of St Peter's, Rome; Filarete stated in his Trattato d'architettura that he trained Pasquino. From 1449 Pasquino was working as Maso di Bartolommeo's assistant, and on behalf of his master he completed the portal of San Domenico, Urbino, from 1450 to 1454."
3762,"PASSALACQUA, Pietro","(b. 1690, Messina, d. 1748, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/passalac/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, nephew of Filippo Juvarra. He moved from Sicily to Rome where he studied under Ludovico Gregorini (1661-1723) together with the latter's son Domenico Gregorini (c.1700-1777). After the death of Ludovico Gregorini in 1723, Domenico inherited his father's studio and Pietro and Domenico collaborated closely in the remainder of their lives, so much so that it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of either of the two architects in the numerous activities in which they took part."
3763,"PASSE, Crispijn van de","(b. ca. 1565, Zeeland, d. 1637, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/passe/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish  printmaker. He was educated in the printing and graphic centre of the sixteenth century, Antwerp, and immediately began his professional career. At the latest in 1585, de Passe became a member of the Guild of St. Luke, the guild of artists and painters. He worked as an engraver for various publishing houses. When Catholic Spain conquered Antwerp in 1588, Crispijn de Passe left with his family, going into exile in Cologne. There he founded his own publishing house. De Passe published his own designs, which were engraved by himself or other members of his studio. Crispijn de Passe's emphasis in his graphic works was on portraits and genre graphics. In 1611, de Passe left Cologne for religious reasons; this time he relocated his studio to Utrecht. There with Aernout van Buchell (Buchelius), de Passe continued his successful work, which was later taken over by his children."
3764,"PASSERI, Giuseppe","(b. 1654, Roma, d. 1714, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/passeri/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, nephew of the painter Giovanni Battista Passeri (c. 1610-1679). He was trained by his uncle and then by Carlo Maratti. The early sources (Pio, Pascoli) claim that he became Maratti's favourite pupil and that, at his own expense, Maratti encouraged him to copy the Roman works of Giovanni Lanfranco, an assertion that is corroborated by surviving copies. Maratti taught him to respect the traditions of Michelangelo and Annibale Carracci, to study the mastery of composition, gesture and expression in works by Reni, Domenichino and Poussin, and to emulate the beauty of colour in the art of Titian and Correggio. Above all, Maratti recommended him to study Raphael, whom he himself revered. Many of Passeri's drawings after these and other artists have survived (three in Düsseldorf). It was through these studies that he developed a relatively independent painting style, one that is distinguished by increasingly free brushwork, a subtle use of colour and lively composition.



"
3765,"PASSEROTTI, Bartolomeo","(b. 1529, Bologna, d. 1592, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/passerot/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo Passerotti (also Passarotti or Passarotto), Italian painter, who except for some years in Rome (c. 1551 - c. 1565) worked in his native Bologna. There he had a large studio, which became the focal point of the city's artistic life. He was a pupil of Girolamo Vignola and Taddeo Zuccaro, in Rome. Here, he also came into contact with the works of Correggio and Parmigianino.
"
3766,PASSIGNANO,"(b. 1559, Passignano, d. 1638, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/passigna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Domenico Cresti. Around the age of nine he was sent to Florence, where, according to Baldinucci, he studied first with Girolamo Macchietti and then with Giovan Battista Naldini. His most important teacher, however, was Federico Zuccaro with whom he worked, from 1575 to 1579, on completing the decoration of the interior of the cupola at the cathedral, which had been left unfinished at the death of Giorgio Vasari in 1574. In 1580 Passignano accompanied Zuccaro to Rome, staying there two years. No works are known from this period, but a few are extant from the following years spent in Venice (1582-88), where exposure to the works of Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese and Palma Giovane seems to have enhanced his use of colour and added a rich atmospheric quality to his Florentine style."
3767,"PASTI, Matteo de'","(b. ca. 1420, Verona, d. ca. 1468, Rimini)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pasti/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, architect, painter and illuminator. He came from a good Veronese family (his father was a doctor, two of his brothers were in the church and three others were merchants). He is first documented in 1441, when he was working in Venice as painter to Piero di Cosimo de' Medici illustrating Petrarch's Trionfi (untraced). Subsequently (1444-46), he worked as an illuminator for the Este court, under the direction of Giorgio d'Alemagna. None of his works from this period is known. He married Elisa Baldigara of Rimini and moved there by 1449."
3768,"PASTORINI, Pastorino de'","(b. ca. 1508, Castelnuovo della Berardenga, d. 1592, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pastorin/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, glass painter and die engraver. He was one of the most prolific and able medallists of the Italian Renaissance, producing around 200 medals. He held various official positions including several in the mints of Emilian courts: in Ferrara (1554-59), in Bologna (1572), in Novellara (1574) and in Florence (1576). In Florence he was 'maestro di stucchi' under Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici (1541; 1574; 1587). He was also renowned as a portraitist in coloured wax for which he apparently developed new materials and techniques to represent hair and skin.



"
3769,"PATCH, Thomas","(b. 1725, Exeter, d. 1782, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patch/biograph.html,"
English painter and engraver, active in Italy. He was the son of a doctor and was expected to become an apothecary. In 1747 he travelled to Rome, where he met Joshua Reynolds and worked in the studio of Claude-Joseph Vernet, producing pastiches of Vernet's work and his own views of Tivoli. However, in 1755 Patch was banished from the Papal States for some homosexual act and settled in Florence. His friendship with the British envoy Sir Horace Mann provided him with introductions to English tourists, who commissioned copies after the Old Masters and views of Florence, such as the Piazza della Signoria (1763; City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth)."
3770,"PATEL, Pierre","(b. ca. 1605, Picardie, d. 1676, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patel/pierre_e/biograph.html,"
French landscape painter, member of a family of painters. He was a pupil of Vouet but worked in the manner of Claude, with whose paintings his own have sometimes been confused."
3771,"PATEL, Pierre-Antoine","(b. 1648, Paris, d. 1707, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patel/pierre_y/biograph.html,"
French painter, son of Pierre Patel. Like his father, he was independent of the Académie Royale, and on 23 July 1677 he was admitted into the Académie de Saint-Luc. About 50 paintings by him survive, as well as gouaches such as Landscape (Rome, Galleria Borghese) which are usually dated to the last 15 years of his life. He presumably learnt his skill as a painter from his father. Their canvases are often confused and at first sight are very similar. A Landscape with the Vision of St Eustace with very brown tonality is his first signed and dated work (1673; private collection). In 1699 he painted a series of 12 landscapes representing the months for the Jesuits' convent of the Maison Professe (now St Paul-St Louis), Paris. These were confiscated during the French Revolution, but nine have been rediscovered and are scattered in various museums, for example his Winter (Paris, Louvre), which has an element of fantasy also present in the later work Dawn (1705; Marseille, Musée des Beaux-Arts).



"
3772,"PATENIER, Joachim","(b. ca. 1480, Bouvignes, d. 1524, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patenier/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, a pioneer of landscape as an independent genre. Nothing is known of his early life, but in 1515 he became a member of the Antwerp Guild. In 1521 he met Dürer, who made a drawing of him and described him as a ""good landscape painter"". There are only a very few signed paintings, but a great many others have been attributed to him with varying degrees of probability. Patenier also painted landscape backgrounds for other artists and The Temptation of St Anthony (Prado, Madrid) was done in collaboration with his friend Quentin Massys (who after Patenier's death became guardian of his children).

"
3773,"PATER, Jean Baptiste Joseph","(b. 1695, Valenciennes, d. 1736, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pater/biograph.html,"
French painter, the only pupil of Watteau (a fellow native of Valenciennes), with whom he had a somewhat touchy relationship. An unlikely legend has it that Watteau dismissed him from his studio (c. 1713) because he was disturbed by the threat  offered by his progress to his own pre-eminence; whatever the reason for their differences, they were reconciled soon before Watteau's death. Like Watteau's other imitator, Lancret, Pater repeated the master's type of 'fêtes galantes' in a fairly stereotyped fashion. He showed more originality in scenes of military life and groups of bathers (in which he gave freer rein to the suggestiveness often seen in his fêtes galantes).



"
3774,"PATERSSON, Benjamin","(b. ca. 1748, Varberg, d. ca. 1815, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patersso/biograph.html,"
Swedish painter and etcher. The son of a customs' scribe, he was a member of the Society of Painters in Gothenburg, where he studied in the studio of the painter S. Frick. In the late 1770s he travelled throughout Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and then on to Riga in 1784 where he lived and worked. Three years later he settled in St. Petersburg, where he lived until the end of his life."
3775,"PATON, Sir Joseph Noel","(b. 1821, Dunfermline, d.1901, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paton/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He began his career as a designer of textiles in Paisley, but studied at the Royal Academy Schools in 1842-43 where he met S. C. Hall, the editor of the influential Art Journal, and the artists Richard Dadd and John Everett Millais. Paton's early reputation rested on his paintings of literary themes (for example, The Quarrel and The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania, both National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh) in which a predilection for fairies is evident, as well as a strong sense of design. His pronounced interest in spiritual or allegorical, as opposed to religious or historical, subject matter was partly derived from his father, who, apart from being a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, was fascinated by the work of William Blake and eventually adopted the religio-scientific views of Emanuel Swedenborg. Paton in fact painted an important composite triptych for the Prayer Room at Osbome House, Isle of Wight, which was installed in 1885 but given to the Parish and Churchwardens of Anmer church, near Sandringham in Norfolk, by Queen Mary in 1921."
3776,"PATTE, Pierre","(b. 1723, Paris, d. 1814, Mantes)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/patte/biograph.html,"
French architect, writer and engraver. He was the son of an officer of the Maison du Roi and began his architectural training in the office of Germain Boffrand. Patte visited Italy in 1750, and during his career he travelled widely in France and went to England (1769) and Germany (1760s)."
3777,"PAUDISS, Christoph","(b. ca. 1625, Lower Saxony, d. 1666, Freising)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paudiss/biograph.html,"
German painter, pupil of Rembrandt. From his apprenticeship, perhaps in Hamburg, he went on to train in the Netherlands from the late 1640s to the early 1650s. After working in Stuttgart (1656), Prague, Dresden (1659-60), Vienna and Salzburg, he stayed his last four years in Freising where he worked for Fürstbischof Albrecht Sigismund von Bayern. He was married twice."
3778,"PAULI, Hanna","(b. 1864, Stockholm, d. 1940, Solna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pauli/biograph.html,"
Hanna Pauli (née Hanna Hirsch) was a Swedish painter. She was a daughter of music publisher Abraham Hirsch. She began her artistic career at the August-Malström school of painting for children in Stockholm. From 1881 to 1885 she studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. From 1885 until 1887 she attended courses at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. She had her portrait of the Finnish sculptress Venny Soldan (now in the Gothenburg Art Museum) accepted to the Paris Salon in 1887. The portrait is realistic and unconventional for its time in portraying a female artist at work (sitting on the floor with clay in her hands) rather than in proper bourgeois attire. She was influenced by Manet and Bastien-Lepage, her free brushwork owes much to her study of French plein-air technique."
3779,"PAULSEN, Julius","(b. 1860, Odense, d. 1940, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paulsen/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He studied at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster, Copenhagen (1879-82), but found the training there uninspired and soon attached himself to more radical artists such as Peder Severin Krøyer and Laurits Regner Tuxen. A turning-point in his career came in 1885 when, with Viggo Johansen and Krøyer, he went to Paris. On the way they visited Amsterdam, where the art of Rembrandt made a great impact on Paulsen. In Paris he showed interest in Courbet and Monet, and, together with Johansen and Krøyer, he exhibited at the Salon."
3780,"PAUR, Hans",(documented 1445-1472 in Nuremberg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/paur/biograph.html,"

English architect, horticulturist, gardener. He is best known for designing the Crystal Palace and for cultivating the Cavendish banana, the most consumed banana in the Western world."
3782,"PEAKE, Robert the Elder","(b. ca. 1551, London, d. 1619, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peake/biograph.html,"
English painter. He may, like members of the de Critz and Gheeraerts families, have been a pupil of Lucas de Heere (c. 1534-c. 1584). He first appears in the pay of the Office of the Revels in 1576. In 1604 he became principal Picture Maker to Henry, Prince of Wales, and in 1607 he was appointed to the Office of Serjeant Painter, a post he held jointly with John de Critz. His works reflect the influence of the warm, brightly coloured and richly patterned miniatures of Nicholas Hilliard and firmly establish Peake within the iconic tradition of late Elizabethan painting."
3783,"PEALE, James","(b. 1749, Chesterton, d. 1831, Philadelphia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peale/biograph.html,"
American painter, member of a family of artists who were active from c. 1760 to c. 1880, and their commitment to art during a period of revolution and nation-building contributed in a large way to the growth of American artistic interests and institutions. The family was established in America by the English post-office clerk Charles Peale (1709-50), a convicted embezzler exiled to the colonies in 1736. His first son, the portrait painter Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827), exerted a major influence on American painting through his own work and that of his sons, brothers and nieces."
3784,"PEARCE, Edward",(d. 1695),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pearce/biograph.html,"
Edward Pearce (Pierce) was a prolific and able wood and stone carver, who worked on decorative sculpture for country houses and churches, for Wren's City churches (he made the wooden model of the copper dragon for the vane of St Mary-le-Bow), the Guildhall, St Paul's Cathedral, Hampton Court, several City Companies, and Clare College, Cambridge. His bust of Wren (1673, Oxford, Ashmolean) shows him with a gift for the restrained Baroque current in England, and a ready eye for liveliness of character. There are works in the Royal Collection, Windor, London and Yale.

3785,"PÉCHEUX, Laurent","(b. 1729, Lyon, d. 1821, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pecheux/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in Italy. Although born in France, Laurent Pécheux spent the majority of his working life in Italy. He left Paris in 1753 for Rome, where he studied under Anton Raphael Mengs and met Pompeo Batoni. He entered the academies of Rome (1762) and Bologna (1764), and was appointed director of the academy in Turin (1777). Although recognized for his portraits, in Turin Pécheux decorated the Biblioteca Reale and painted frescos for the church of San Domenico.

3786,"PÉCHY, Mihály","(b. 1755, Álmosd, d. 1819, Fejérszék)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pechy/biograph.html,"
Hungarian architect and military engineer. He graduated from the Vienna Academy of Engineering and served in various military engineering positions. In 1809 he led the defense of Gyõ. His early architectural works are characterized by late Baroque lurking in classicism. His major works, the Debrecen Reformed Great Church (1805-1821) and the Debrecen Reformed College (1804-1818), are already outstanding works of Hungarian Neoclassicism.


"
3787,"PECORARI, Francesco",(active 1300-1340 in Lombardy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pecorari/biograph.html,"
Italian architect from Cremona. His known works are the octagonal campanile of San Gottardo, Milan; the tower of the church of the Chiaravalle Abbey in Milan; and the Torrazzo, the bell tower of Cremona Cathedral. Other biographical details are not available.

Flemish tapestry weaver, active in Brussels from 1660 to c. 1710. He was the son-in-law of the weaver Geraert van der Streecken (died 1677). At the time he acquired a privilege in 1665 he had six looms working. In the period 1703-07 there were still four. He repeatedly collaborated with Willem van Leefdael (1632-1688), for instance for the sets of the Acts of the Apostles (Museo Arqueologico, Madrid), Caesar and Cleopatra after Justus van Egmont (Chicago), Titus and Vespasian after Charles Poerson (1609-1667). He produced most of the editions of Zenobia after Justus van Egmont (Brussels; Madrid; Lucca, Palazzo Mansi), also Alexander after Charles Le Brun (Würzburg), Months after David III Teniers (1638-1685) (Vienna).



"
3791,"PEETERS, Clara","(b. 1594, Antwerpen, d. after 1657)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peeters/biograph.html,"
An important Flemish woman painter, who introduced the Dutch type of ""Breakfast Piece"" into Antwerp at a very early date. She was born in Antwerp but later moved to Amsterdam (in 1612) and The Hague (in 1617).
"
3792,"PEETERS, Bonaventura the Elder","(b. 1614, Antwerpen, d. 1652, Hoboken)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peetersb/bonavent/biograph.html,"
Flemish marine painter and satirical poet. He was virtually the only noteworthy practitioner in the genre in his country, seascapes being much more a Dutch than a Flemish speciality. In his early works Peeters was influenced by Dutch masters such as Simon de Vlieger, but later he tended to introduce elaborate motifs and bright colour in a decorative vein less impressive than his earlier style. Peeters became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1634.

"
3793,"PEETERS, Gillis I","(b. 1612, Antwerpen, d. 1653, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peetersb/gillis/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, member of a family of marine and landscape painters. He became a master of the Antwerp guild of St Luke in 1634 along with his brother Bonaventura, with whom he is known to have shared a studio in Antwerp. His oeuvre consists chiefly of landscapes, many of which reveal a debt to the work of Paul Bril. In 1637-38 he accompanied to Brazil Johan Maurits van Nassau (byname The Brazilian, 1604-1679). Van Nassau was the Dutch colonial governor and military commander who consolidated Dutch rule in Brazil (1636-44), thereby bringing the Dutch empire in Latin America to the peak of its power.

Like Pittoni, he worked for many foreign patrons and travelled widely. He was first recorded as a painter in 1703 and soon after this he married the sister of Rosalba Carriera, who mentions him in her diary on several occasions. In 1707 Lord Manchester went on an embassy to Venice; he commissioned a picture to celebrate the event from Carlevaris and brought Pellegrini and Marco Ricci back to London with him in 1708. Pellegrini soon had considerable success and became a Director of Kneller's Academy in 1711.

3797,PELLEGRINO DA SAN DANIELE,"(b. 1467, San Daniele del Friuli, d. 1547, Udine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pellegrj/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, originally Martino da Udine. In spite of his name, he probably was born in Udine. He was the most important painter in Friuli in his days; he received many commissions in this region. His masterpiece is the fresco decoration of the church of S. Antonio Abate in San Daniele. Due to its fame it is called the ""Sistine Chapel of Friuli"".



"
3798,"PELLIZZA DA VOLPEDO, Giuseppe","(b. 1868, Volpedo, d. 1907, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pellizza/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He came from a farming family and in 1884 began attending drawing classes at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. He also began to study painting, first with Giuseppe Puricelli (1832-94) and then in 1886-87 with Pio Sanquirico (1847-1900), but in 1887 he broke off his studies at the Brera and moved to Rome in order to attend the Accademia di San Luca. He very soon became disappointed by the teaching there, which he combined with attendance at the life class at the Académie de France, and went to Florence, where from 1888 he was a pupil of Giovanni Fattori at the Accademia di Belle Arti. After a few months he returned to Volpedo, where he began executing portraits and landscapes that show the influence of the Macchiaioli in their limpid layers of light and geometrically balanced compositions (e.g. Portrait of the Poor Girl and the Piazza di Volpedo, both 1888; both private collection)."
3799,"PENCZ, Georg","(b. ca. 1500, Nuremberg, d. 1550, Nuremberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pencz/biograph.html,"
German painter and engraver of religious and mythological subjects and portraits, active in his native Nuremberg, where he was an assistant of Dürer. He travelled in Italy early in his career and again in 1539, when he is recorded in Florence and Rome, and his work is deeply imbued with Italian influence. The sharp outlines and glossy textures of his portraits show, in particular, a kinship with Bronzino. In 1525 Pencz was expelled from Nuremberg with the Beham brothers, two other ""godless artists"", for their radical Protestant views, but the sentence was soon revoked and he returned to the city. In 1550, he was appointed painter to Duke Albrecht of Prussia, but died in the same year.

French enameller, part of a family of enamellers active in Limoges. Probably one of the sons of the enameller Nardon Pénicaud and nephew to Jean Pénicaud I, Jean Pénicaud II was the leading exponent in Limoges of a Renaissance style based on the Italian Mannerism of the Fontainebleau School. He excelled in both grisaille and polychrome painted enamels, though he showed a preference for grisaille work and his extant polychrome works are rare. He created both ecclesiastical and secular work and is especially known for his reliquaries and portraits such as the medallion of Pope Clement VII (Paris, Musée du Louvre). His signed and dated works are few but his style is recognisable especially in his fine representation of faces and use of subtle flesh tones.

He produced polychrome enamels of religious subjects borrowing details from woodcuts. He was one of the earliest masters to exercise a style that contrasted dramatically with the vivid colours employed in the earlier champlevé period. Enamels painted in Lyon were dark and sombre, reflecting the pessimism prevalent during the Reformation.

3803,"PÉNICAUD, Pierre","(b. ca. 1515, Limoges, d. ca. 1590, Limoges)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/penicaud/pierre/biograph.html,"
French enameller. Pierre Pénicaud was the last prominent member of a French family of enamellers active in Limoges during the sixteenth century. Members of the family were noted for their work in grisaille enamel, monochromatically painted enamel work intended to look like sculpture.



"
3804,"PENNACCHI, Pier Maria","(b. 1464, Treviso, d. ca. 1515, Treviso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pennacch/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a significant figure in the artistic life of Treviso, and, as he is recorded there almost annually from 1483, he could not have been a pupil with Giovanni Bellini in Venice from 1490 to 1500, as has been suggested. Many works by him are documented, the earliest in 1495, but only one documented work survives: the fresco of Christ in the semi-dome of the chapel of the Santissimo in Treviso Cathedral, commissioned in 1511. The chronology of his oeuvre is thus highly problematic. Among his presumed early works were the Virgin and Child with Saints, influenced by Girolamo da Treviso the elder and Antonello da Messina, and the Dead Christ with Angels (both destroyed in Berlin). These reflected Northern art, including engravings by Dürer."
3805,"PENNI, Giovan Francesco","(b. ca. 1488, Firenze, d. 1528, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/penni/giovan/biograph.html,"
Giovan Francesco (Gianfrancesco) Penni, known also as Il Fattore, Italian painter, pupil of Raphael. Born in Florence to a family of weavers, Penni entered very early in Raphael's workshop, and collaborated with him for several works, including the Stanze of the Vatican Palace as well as the frescoes of Villa Farnesina, both in Rome. After the premature death of Raphael, Penni collaborated with Giulio Romano to the completion of works such as the Hall of Constantine, the Transfiguration, the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin (1525) in Monteluce, and the Palazzo del Tè of Mantua."
3806,"PENNI, Luca","(b. ca. 1500, Firenze, d. 1556, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/penni/luca/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother of Giovan Francesco Penni. He came from a family of Florentine weavers and may have been Raphael's pupil in Rome, since his brother had an important position in Raphael's Roman workshop. In the late 1520s, Penni worked with his brother-in-law Perino del Vaga in Genoa and Lucca."
3807,PENSIONANTE DEL SARACENI,(active 1610-1620s in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pensiona/biograph.html,"In an article published in 1943, the scholar Roberto Longhi, a great authority on Caravaggio's followers, attributed a group of four paintings to an artist whose identity remains unknown, but who was clearly influenced by the Venetian painter Carlo Saraceni. He dubbed this presumed pupil or associate 'Pensionante del Saraceni', literally the lodger or boarder of Saraceni. Saraceni, who worked in Rome from 1598 until about 1619, is documented as having accommodated several artists and the so-called Pensionante may have been one of them. On occasion, the artist has been identified as Jean LeClerc (c. 1587-1632), a native of Nancy, documented as Saraceni's assistant. This identification, however, remains conjectural and Netherlandish or Flemish origins have also been proposed.

"
3808,"PEPIJN, Marten","(b. 1575, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1643, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pepijn/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. His years of apprenticeship are obscure, but in 1600 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. The following year he married Maria Huybrechts, with whom he had five children. One son became a painter, as did his daughter Katherine Pepijn (1619-1668), who painted portraits of clerics in the style of Rubens and van Dyck. Between 1602 and 1628 Marten Pepijn took on eight apprentices. His portrait was painted by van Dyck (1632; Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp). It was suggested that Pepijn had travelled to Italy and that Rubens, who viewed him as a rival, was pleased to see him go; this tale is unlikely in view of the inequality of talent and because the two men were friends."
3809,"PERANDA, Sante","(b. 1566, Venezia, d. 1638, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peranda/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice. He was a pupil of the painter Leonardo Corona and later Palma Giovane. His main works are a Descent from the Cross for San Procolo in Venice, The defeat of the Saracens in the Doge's Palace and the Gathering of the Manna in the church of the San Bartolome. Francesco Maffei, Matteo Ponzone, and Filippo Zanimberti were among his pupils.

3810,"PERCIER, Charles","(b. 1764, Paris, d. 1838, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/percier/biograph.html,"
French architect and interior designer, partner with Pierre Fontaine. This pair of architects redesigned the Tuileries Palace, Paris, and Saint-Cloud, for the Emperor Napoleon from circa 1801 to 1804. They were named ""architectes du gouvernement"" by Napoleon in 1801 and ""Architectes du Louvre et des Tuileries"" in 1804. They helped create the influential Empire style of interior decoration."

3812,"PEREDA, Antonio de","(b. 1611, Valladolid, d. 1678, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pereda/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active mainly in Madrid. He began as a history painter - his Relief of Genoa (Prado, Madrid, 1635) was painted for the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid as part of the same series as Velázquez's Surrender of Breda - but he is now best known for his still-lifes. The most famous painting associated with him is The Knight's Dream (also called The Dream of Life or Life is a Dream, Academy, Madrid, c. 1650), a splendidly sensuous composition, full of brilliantly painted still-life details, in which worldly pleasures and treasures are seen to be as insubstantial as a dream. It was a key work in the development of the moralizing still-life in Spain, influencing Valdés Leal in particular. However, the attribution to Pereda has recently been questioned, and Francisco de Palacios (1622/5-52) has been suggested as the author.



"
3813,"PEREGO, Giovanni","(b. 1776, Milano, d. 1817, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perego/biograph.html,"
Italian scenographer and architect. He attended the Accademia di Brera where he studied scenography under the aegis of Paolo Landriani (1757-1839). Thanks to his master, in 1807 he worked hard at the Teatro alla Scala, restoring Neoclassical ceiling decorations. He was an extremely creative person, particularly skilled in making prospective effects. Some of his works are still preserved at the Stage Museum of the Scala and at the Antonio Caccia Foundation Museum in Lugano. He also made the decorations of the Court Theater of the Royal Villa of Monza."
3814,"PÉRELLE, Gabriel","(b. 1604, Vernon-sur-Seine, d. 1677, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perelle/biograph.html,"
French printmaker. He studied drawing with Daniel Rabel and started making etchings in 1635; his first plates, somewhat dry in style, showed the influence of the Flemish landscape artists Paul Bril and Roelandt Savery. From c. 1645 until 1657 he worked on plates of Les Glorieuses Conquètes de Louis Le Grand, for the collection known as the Petit Beaulieu; he was granted the titles of Ingénieur du Roi and Graveur du Roi. About 1655 his work began to evolve towards depicting nature in a more dramatic aspect, animated by waterfalls and buildings, in the style of Gaspard Dughet. From 1660 onwards the contrast of light and shade in his prints gave way to an emphasis on restless foliage and heavy skies and a greater use of stippling."
3815,"PEREYRA, Manuel","(b. 1588, Porto, d. 1683, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pereyra/biograph.html,"
Manuel Pereyra (Pereira), Portuguese sculptor, active in Spain. He probably arrived in Spain fully trained, although nothing is known of his apprenticeship. His career was spent based in Madrid and its environs. He was a prolific sculptor who worked in wood and stone, including alabaster, but unlike some Spanish sculptors he practised neither as an architect nor as a polychromist, work that he subcontracted to other specialists. Although his range of style was narrow, he ranks as one of the major Spanish sculptors of the 17th century.



"
3816,"PÉREZ, Bartolomé","(b. 1634, Madrid, d. 1693, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perez/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and decorator. He was an outstanding pupil of his father-in-law, Juan de Arellano, whose daughter he married in 1663, and whom he succeeded as the most important representative of flower painting in Madrid. He enjoyed a successful career as a decorative painter, regularly working for the Teatro Real of the Buen Retiro (works lost today), for which services he was given the honorary title of Pintor del Rey in 1689."
3817,"PÉREZ SIERRA, Francisco","(b. 1627, Napoli, d. 1709, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perez_s/biograph.html,"
Spanish  painter. He was the pupil of Aniello Falcone in Naples, and Juan de Toledo in  Madrid. He excelled in painting battles and executed several altarpieces for churches."

Spanish painter and draughtsman. He attended the Colegio Militar in Santiago, Galicia, and then began literary studies in Madrid. After a period as an army officer, he embarked on a career as an artist during a stay in Cadiz, where he had been brought as a prisoner-of-war in 1823. He attended classes at the Academia de Cadiz and soon achieved some fame in the city. In 1830 he was commissioned to decorate the Tapia theatre in the Caribbean city of San Juan in Puerto Rico. In 1833 he returned to Spain and in Seville met the Scottish painter David Roberts, who introduced him to the British Romantic landscape style, in which he then continued to work for the rest of his life."
3819,PERINO DEL VAGA,"(b. 1501, Firenze, d. 1547, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He trained in Florence, first with Andrea de' Ceri and from the age of 11 with Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. According to Vasari, he practised drawing by copying Michelangelo's cartoon for the Battle of Cascina (destroyed). For Pope Leo X's entry into Florence in November 1515 he painted an allegorical figure on one of the twelve triumphal arches. Soon after, an obscure Florentine painter called Vaga took Perino to Rome, where he became known as del Vaga. There he continued his drawing studies, copying from works of antiquity and Michelangelo's ceiling in the Sistine Chapel. On the recommendation of Giulio Romano and Giovanni Francesco Penni, he joined Raphael's workshop, where he learnt stuccowork and how to design grotesques, through assisting Giovanni da Udine in the Vatican Logge. Soon he was painting scenes from Raphael's designs, and five or six ceiling frescoes in the Logge, including the Story of Joshua and the Story of David, are generally accepted as his. Vasari drew particular attention to scenes under the windows that are painted to look like bronze reliefs (badly damaged). Pictures of this kind became a speciality of Perino's. Before the death of Leo X in 1521, he worked with Giovanni da Udine again, on the ceiling frescoes in the Sala dei Pontefici at the Vatican. On his own he executed the decoration of the hall in Palazzo Baldassini (1520-22) and the Pietà in Chiesa di S. Stefano del Cacco. "

Permoser was the leading Late Baroque sculptor in Dresden, where he helped to create the Zwinger. He was trained in Salzburg c. 1663 before going to Italy for fourteen years. He arrived there c. 1675 and went to Venice, Rome, Florence and other cities; in Florence he carved the façade of the S. Gaetano (c. 1684) and worked for the Grand Duke Cosimo III, who tried to secure him as Court Sculptor. Permoser, however, went to Dresden as Court Sculptor in 1689. He spent the rest of his life there, except for several trips to Berlin, a visit to Italy in 1697/98 and another in 1725, when, at the age of 74, he walked to Rome. He returned in 1728."

He moved to Bologna and attended the Accademia Clementina, where he worked under the masters Ercole Lelli (1702-1766), Felice Torelli, and Donato Creti. Then he moved to Rome to work with Agostino Masucci (1690-1768). In 1738, he received first prize for a painting submitted to an exhibition at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome.

French painter, born to a modest family. A student of William Bouguereau and François-Edouard Picot, he exhibited at the Salon from 1863 onwards, producing many genre works which were immensely popular. He was famous for his paintings of children. His focus on children, who he saw as innocent and charming, appealed to the growing cult of childhood that saw children not as miniature adults but as beings with their own characteristics."

He won a medal in the drawing class in 1772 but did not reach the final of the Prix de Rome until 1776, when he won a second prize for Haman Confounded by Esther before Ahasuerus (untraced). He continued his attempts to win the Prix de Rome until 1780 without success, but in that year he was granted the bursary because the winner Jean-Pierre Saint-Ours was Swiss and therefore ineligible to go."
3828,"PERRONNEAU, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1715, Paris, d. 1783, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/perronne/biograph.html,"French painter and engraver. He worked mainly as a portraitist and mainly in pastel. In this medium he was overshadowed in his lifetime by Maurice Quentin de La Tour, whose style was more vivacious, but posterity has judged the more sober but more penetrating Perronneau to be at least his equal. From about 1755 he led a wandering life, visiting England, the Netherlands several times (he died in Amsterdam), Italy, Poland, and Russia. He was a prolific artist and is represented in many galleries in France and elsewhere.

Better known for her artwork, she also wrote four volumes of poetry. Although she had no formal art training until age 36, Lilla Cabot Perry became a professional painter and a devotee of French Impressionism with a formidable body of work. She developed a solid reputation during her lifetime as a painter, helping to promote Impressionism in the U.S. and Japan."

Sienese architect, painter, and stage designer, active mainly in Rome, where he settled in 1503. He worked under Bramante on St Peter's, and eventually became architect to the building after Raphael's death in 1520. Amongst High Renaissance architects he ranks almost alongside these two contemporaries, but his style was very different - sophisticated and delicate rather than monumental and grave. In spite of his genius he had little material success, according to Vasari because of his 'retiring nature'. His greatest works - indeed the greatest secular building of the High Renaissance - is the Villa Farnesina (1508-11) in Rome. The Farnesina contains decorations by Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and Sodoma, as well as Peruzzi's own masterpiece in painting - the Sala delle Prospettive, a brilliant piece of feigned architectural painting that confirms early accounts of his skill in perspective and stage-design.

In 1703, as a pupil at the Académie Royale, he would have won the Prix de Rome with his Moses and the Daughters of Jethro (untraced), had not Jules Hardouin Mansart, adviser to the Académie, deemed all entries that year unworthy. Nevertheless Pesne left for Italy, making the acquaintance of Jean Raoux in Venice and being allowed the use of a studio in Rome by Charles Poërson, Director of the Académie de France. While in Venice, Pesne painted the portrait of Friedrich Ernst von Knyphausen (Berlin, Schloss Charlottenburg, destr. 1893), a lively work indebted to Veronese that is said to have decided King Frederick I of Prussia to invite Pesne to Berlin."

He then stayed in Munich until the autumn of 1878 but made many study trips abroad: he returned to Norway but also visited London and Paris and made several journeys to Italian cities. He thus acquired a more profound knowledge of both earlier and contemporary European art than that available to most Norwegians studying in Munich."

However, neither a precise chronology of his life nor a comprehensive catalogue of his paintings has yet been established."
3848,"PETROVIÆ, Nadežda","(b. 1873, Èaèak, d. 1915, Valjevo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/petrovic/biograph.html,"
Serbian painter, critic and exhibition organizer. She studied painting at an early age with her father, a drawing teacher, and became a teacher herself. In 1898 she went to Munich and studied first in the studio of F. Haas and in the school led by Anton Ažbe (1862-1905), then under Julius Exter (1863-1930), whose plein-air practice was discernible in her early works."
3849,"PETTENKOFEN, August von","(b. 1822, Wien, d. 1889, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pettenko/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter and lithographer. He studied (1837-40) under Leopold Kupelwieser at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna. From 1837 to about 1847 he worked intensively in the relatively new medium of lithography. The caricatures he provided for Viennese magazines such as Der Kobold or Wiener Blatter reveal the strong influence of French lithography."
3850,"PEYRE, Marie-Joseph","(b. 1730, Paris, d. 1785, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peyre/biograph.html,"
French architect. He began his training in Paris with Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774) at l'École des Arts, where he met Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni and formed a lifelong friendship with Charles de Wailly. He won the Prix de Rome for architecture in 1751 and was a pensionnaire at the French Academy in Rome from 1753, where he was soon joined by de Wailly, the following year's winner, who brought with him Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux, whose sister Peyre eventually married. Peyre stayed in Rome until early in 1756, during the years when the students at the Academy were creating temporary projects in the new Neoclassical manner."
3851,"PEYRON, Jean-François-Pierre","(b. 1744, Aix-en-Provence, d. 1814, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/peyron/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. He was the son of a provincial administrator and at the wish of his family studied law until the death of his father in 1765, when as a protégé of Michel-François Dandré-Bardon he enrolled in the Ecole de Dessin at Aix-en-Provence. In 1767 he moved to Paris as a pupil of Louis Lagrenée and also enrolled in the school of the Académie Royale de Peinture. In 1773 he won the Prix de Rome in competition with Jacques-Louis David. Peyron's version of the prize subject, the Death of Seneca (untraced), is known through an engraving by the artist. In 1774, working to designs by Charles-Louis Clérisseau, he decorated the salon of the Hôtel Grimod de la Reyniere, Paris, with the first examples of Neo-classical grotesque decoration in 18th-century France."
3852,"PFORR, Franz","(b. 1788, Frankfurt, d. 1812, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pforr/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was one of the founders of the Nazarenes and went to Rome with other members of the group in 1810. His work evokes a fairy-tale type of medievalism, with bright colours and picturesque details. It is best represented in the Städelsches Kunstinstitut of his native Frankfort.



"
3853,"PHILANDER, Guillaume","(b. 1505, Châtillon-sur-Seine, d. 1565, Toulouse)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/philande/biograph.html,"
Guillaume Philander (or Philandrier), French writer and architect. The son of an old Burgundian family, he received a humanist education and acquired a reputation as a scholar. In 1533 he became secretary to Georges d'Armagnac, Bishop of Rodez. He prepared an annotated edition of Quintilian's work on oratory and, at his patron's instigation, took an interest in architecture. In 1536 he accompanied d'Armagnac when he went as ambassador to Venice and there met Sebastiano Serlio, who was to have a great influence on him. D'Armagnac was subsequently appointed ambassador to Pope Paul III and in 1539 left Venice for Rome, so giving his protégé the opportunity to frequent the humanist milieu of that city."
3854,"PHILIPSEN, Theodor Esbern","(b. 1840, København, d. 1920, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/philipse/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, sculptor and draughtsman. He studied at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster, Copenhagen, in 1862-63 and 1865-69, and in Paris under Léon Bonnat in 1875-76. He was an important figure in the development and renewal of Danish naturalism, linking the Danish Golden Age tradition with new French ideas. Conscious of the importance of plein-air painting, he was first a great admirer of the Barbizon school; later he was influenced by the Impressionists, becoming the only truly Danish Impressionist. Frequent visits abroad helped him develop his outlook; he eagerly studied the Old Masters, and the strong light of the south."
3855,"PHILLIPS, Thomas","(b. 1770, Dudley, d. 1845, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/phillips/biograph.html,"
English painter. From a respectable but impoverished family, he left school aged 13 to be apprenticed to Francis Eginton of Birmingham, a glass painter and early pioneer in reproduction by a 'photographic method'. The chiaroscuro effects of this process were a lasting influence on Phillips's style. In 1790 he moved to London to study at the Royal Academy and simultaneously assisted in Benjamin West's studio. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1794 to 1844 and was elected ARA in 1804, RA in 1808 and Professor of Painting in succession to Henry Fuseli from 1825 to 1832. As a portrait painter he was often more interested in the mind of his sitters than fashionable exteriors and caught 'the noble gloom of the romantic pose'.

3857,"PIAMONTINI, Giuseppe","(b. 1664, Firenze, d. 1742, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piamonti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He began his career in Giovanni Battista Foggini's studio in Florence. From 1681 to 1686 he studied at the Accademia Fiorentina in Rome under Ercole Ferrata and Ciro Ferri. In 1685, with fellow students Giovanni Camillo Cateni, Francesco Ciaminghi (d. 1736) and Antonio Francesco Andreozzi (1663-1730), he executed roundel reliefs in glazed terracotta of the Stations of the Cross from designs by Ferri commissioned by Cosimo III, in the convent church of S Pietro d'Alcantara in Montelupo, his contribution being the Deposition, Entombment (Montelupo, SS Quirico e Lucia all' Ambrogiana) and Flagellation (private collection). The last of these is particularly instructive, because Ferri's wax model for it still survives (Staatliche Museen, Berlin).

Italian painter. Between 1718 and 1725 he travelled and studied in northern Italy. Around 1720 he is recorded in Milan and it was during this formative period that he came into contact with the chief protagonists of the revival of Lombard painting, above all Magnasco. To his youthful Lombard period can be assigned the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (Pescarenico, Chiesa Parrochiale) and the Holy Family (Verbania, Madonna di Compagna). Apart from Magnasco, another major influence was the fresco cycle painted by Filippo Abbiati (1640-1715), whose somewhat macabre subject matter and tenebrist technique evidently struck a chord with Pianca and provided him with a continuing source of inspiration."
3859,"PIANTA, Francesco","(b. ca. 1634, Venezia, d. 1690, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pianta/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, lived and worked in Venice, who signed himself ""Franciscus Pianta iunior venetus"" (Francesco Pianta the Younger of Venice) on the base of his portrait of Tintoretto. The group of altar frontals which decorate three walls of the Sala Grande Superiore (Upper Hall) of the Scuola di San Rocco is linked to his name."

Italian painter, part of a family of painters. Their workshop dominated art in Lodi in the 16th century. Early collaborative projects with Martino and Albertino remain problematic."
3861,"PIAZZA DA LODI, Martino","(b. 1475/80, Lombardy, d. 1523, ?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piazza/martino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters. Their workshop dominated art in Lodi in the 16th century. Martino Piazza and Albertino Piazza (1490-1528/9) were brothers, who frequently collaborated; both are documented at the Incoronata at Lodi in 1514. Martino's oeuvre has been reconstructed on the basis of two pictures, St John the Baptist (London, National Gallery) and an Adoration of the Shepherds (Milan, Ambrosiana), which bear the monogram MPP; he was an eclectic artist, indebted to Leonardo da Vinci. Albertino's more classical style is revealed in his Coronation of the Virgin (1519; Lodi, Incoronata)."
3862,"PIAZZETTA, Giacomo","(b. 1640, Pederobbe, d. 1705, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piazzett/giacomo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and intaglio artist, part of a family of artists. Giacomo Piazzetta's renown in his own day was sufficient to earn him the sobriquet of 'palmifer' or bearer of the victor's palm. He has since been chiefly remembered as the father of the more famous Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, a painter and draughtsman, who was one of the most distinguished artists in 18th-century Venice."
3863,"PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1683, Venezia, d. 1754, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piazzett/giovanni/biograph.html,"Venetian painter, son of Giacomo Piazzetta, a woodcarver, who studied under Giuseppe Maria Crespi in Bologna and was probably influenced by him to take up genre subjects. He settled in Venice by 1711, and after his death his family petitioned the State for a pension, claiming that his 'constant studies and his pursuit of glory rather than gain had reduced him to poverty and hastened his death'.

"
3864,"PICART, Jean Michel","(b. ca. 1600, Antwerpen, d. 1682, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/picart/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in France. He was born in Antwerp but moved to Paris before 1635 where he set up as a painter and art dealer. He lived in Saint-Germain-des-Prés along with many other of the Flemish artists who emigrated to that city. Picart was interested in collecting and dealing various types of paintings such as Dutch and Flemish landscapes, hunting scenes by Snyders or smaller religious compositions."
3865,"PICCINI, Giacomo","(b. ca. 1617, Venezia, d. ca. 1669, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piccini/biograph.html,"
Giacomo Piccini (also Gianjacopo Pecini), Italian printmaker, active in Venice.  His subjects were religious and mythological scenes. He was the brother of Guglielmo Piccini and the father and teacher of Isabella Piccini (1664-1734) and Pietro Piccini (active 1661-1672), all were active printmakers in Venice."
3866,"PICCOLPASSO, Cipriano di Michele","(b. ca. 1523, Castel Durante, d. 1579, Castel Durante)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piccolpa/biograph.html,"
Italian writer and maiolica painter. He came from a patrician family of Bolognese descent  that had been settled since the mid-fifteenth century in Castel Durante, which was an important centre for the manufacture of maiolica. He was a humanist by education and an amateur devotee of the arts. He was also active as a dilettante poet, land surveyor, civil and military engineer and draughtsman."
3867,"PICHLER, Joseph von","(b. 1730, Kötschach, d. 1808, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pichler/biograph.html,"
Joseph von Pichler (also Püchler) was an Austrian painter specialised in flower painting. From 1752 he studied with Vinzenz Fischer at the School of Architectural Drawing in Vienna. It is not clear how he became a flower painter.



"
3868,"PICHORE, Jean",(active 1500-1520 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pichore/biograph.html,"
French illuminator, designer of manuscripts and printed books. He was active in Paris, although Cardinal Georges d'Amboise, archbishop of Rouen, was one of his major clients. Therefore, his style had been mistakenly referred to as 'School of Rouen'. Pichore is documented as having worked on two manuscripts, the first volume of Augustine's De civitate Dei of c. 1501/03 (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale) and the Chants royaux for Louise of Savoy of 1517 (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale). Pichore managed a large family enterprise that was responsible for the illumination of a great number of classical, secular, and theological texts. He also played an important role in the market for printed books by providing Renaissance designs."
3869,"PICKENOY, Nicolaes Eliasz.","(b. 1588, Amsterdam, d. 1654/56, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pickenoy/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He is frequently incorrectly referred to in the literature without his family name. He was a son of the monumental mason Elias Claesz. Pickenoy who had come to Amsterdam from Antwerp. Nicolaes may have studied painting with Cornelis van der Voort, one of the most important portrait painters in Amsterdam, who also originally came from Antwerp. The earliest work attributed to Pickenoy is Anatomy Lesson of Sebastiaen Egbertsz. de Vrij (1619; Amsterdam, Historical Museum). Although Pickenoy's paintings included other subjects, he apparently earned his living primarily as a portrait painter. Soon after 1624 he succeeded to van der Voort's place as a portrait painter whose work was greatly in demand from the upper-class citizens of Amsterdam.



"
3870,"PICOT, François-Edouard","(b. 1786, Paris, d. 1868, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/picot/biograph.html,"
French painter and lithographer. He was a pupil of François-André Vincent and of Jacques-Louis David. He received the Second Grand Prix de Rome in 1811 and then continued his studies in Rome. On his return from Italy he received the commission to paint the Death of Sapphira (1819) for the church of St Séverin in Paris (in situ) and at the Salon of 1819 he exhibited Love and Psyche (1817; Paris, Louvre), which was admired for its graceful and naive figures and was bought by the Duc d'Orléans (later Louis-Philippe, King of France). At the Salon of 1827 Picot exhibited the Annunciation (La Rochelle Cathedral), a richly painted work that shows the influence of Raphael. Working within the Neo-classical style, he specialized in history and genre subjects and portraits and continued to show at the Salon until 1839.



"

French painter belonging to the French Neo-classical school of painting of the second half of the 19th century. A student of Paul Delaroche in Paris, he befriends the artists Jean-Léon Gérôme and Charles Gleyre and his style will show their influence."
3872,"PIENEMAN, Jan Willem","(b. 1779, Abcoude, d. 1853, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pieneman/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, teacher, engraver and museum director. He trained with a wallpaper painter in Amsterdam, and at the same time he followed courses at the Amsterdam Stadstekenacademie, where he soon distinguished himself. His artistic and didactic gifts were recognized by the Napoleonic government, which in 1805 appointed him professor of drawing at the artillery and engineering school in Amersfoort. In 1816 he was appointed assistant director of the Mauritshuis at The Hague by William I. He frequently spent time at the Dutch court, where he gave painting lessons to Queen Wilhelmina and painted many portraits of members of the royal family. He also produced a few engravings.



"
3873,PIER FRANCESCO FIORENTINO,"(b. ca. 1444, Firenze, d. ca. 1497, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pier/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, the son of a little-known Florentine artist, Bartolomeo di Donato. He is recorded in his father's catasto declaration of 1469-1470 as a twenty-five-year-old priest. The young painter-priest most likely received his early training in his father's shop, but his first major association was with Benozzo Gozzoli. Stylistic evidence suggests that he was a member of Gozzoli's studio in San Gimignano when the elder artist moved there in 1464. Pier Francesco's career is framed by two documented altarpieces, a Madonna and Child with Saints in the Museo Collegiata, Empoli, of 1474, and a 1494 signed and dated Madonna and Child with Eight Saints in the church of Sant'Agostino in San Gimignano."
3874,"PIERATTI, Domenico","(b. 1600, Firenze, d. 1656, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pieratti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was active in Florence for all but the last years of his life. He worked in marble and stone both independently and in conjunction with his brother Giovanni Battista (1599-1662), who also produced independent works of sculpture but turned increasingly to architecture. Both were apprenticed to the sculptor Chiarissimo Fancelli (d. 1632) and then assisted Andrea di Michelangelo Ferrucci (d. 1626)."
3875,PIERINO DA VINCI,"(b. ca. 1529, Vinci, d. 1553, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pierino/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, originally Pierfrancesco di Bartolomeo di Ser Piero da Vinci, nephew of Leonardo da Vinci. His brief life was characterized by a precocious and promising sculptural career. He began his apprenticeship in Baccio Bandinelli's Florence workshop when he was about 12 but transferred shortly afterwards to that of Niccolò Tribolo; at the time Tribolo was working on the monumental fountains for the gardens of the Medici villa at Castello, near Florence."
3876,"PIERMARINI, Giuseppe","(b. 1734, Foligno, d. 1808, Foligno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piermari/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He trained as an architect in his birth town and was a pupil of Luigi Vanvitelli; he worked with him in Rome and Naples. In 1769 he went to Milan with Vanvitelli and became one of Lombardy's most important architects of the time. He was appointed Imperial Architect of the Realm in 1779."
3877,PIERMATTEO D'AMELIA,"(known from 1467, d. ca. 1502, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piermatt/biograph.html,"
Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia, Italian painter. In 1467-69 he collaborated with Filippo Lippi in the decoration of the apse of the Duomo of Spoleto. He also worked in Perugia, Orvieto and Rome. In Rome in 1479-80 he decorated the vault of the Sistine Chapel (gold stars on blue ground). Among his other works the Pala dei Francescani in Terni, and an Annunciation could be mentioned."
3878,PIERO della FRANCESCA,"(b. 1416, Borgo San Sepolcro, d. 1492, Borgo San Sepolcro)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piero/biograph.html,"Italian painter, virtually forgotten for centuries after his death, but regarded since his rediscovery in the early 20th century as one of the supreme artists of the  quattrocento. He was born in Borgo San Sepolcro (now Sansepolcro) in Umbria and spent much of his life there. We hear of him also at various times in Ferrara, Rimini, Arezzo, Rome, and Urbino. But he found the origins of his style in Florence, and he probably lived there as a young man for some time during the 1430s, although he is documented there only once, in 1439 (the first known reference to him), when he was assisting Domenico Veneziano on frescoes (now lost) in S. Egidio. His first documented work, the polyptych of the Madonna della Misericordia (Pinacoteca, Sansepolcro), commissioned in 1445 but not completed until much later, shows that he had studied and absorbed the artistic discoveries of his great Florentine predecessors and contemporaries - Masaccio, Donatello, Domenico Veneziano, Filippo Lippi, Uccello, and even Masolino, who anticipated something of Piero's use of broad masses of colour. Piero unified, completed, and refined upon the discoveries these artists had made in the previous 20 years and created a style in which monumental, meditative grandeur and almost mathematical lucidity are combined with limpid beauty of colour and light. His major work is a series of  frescos on the Legend of the True Cross in the choir of San Francesco at Arezzo (c. l452-c. l465). The subject was a medieval legend of great complexity, but Piero made from its fanciful details some of the most solemn and serene images in western art — even the two battle scenes have a feeling of grim deliberation rather than violent movement. He was a slow and thoughtful worker and often applied wet cloths to the plaster at night so that — contrary to normal fresco practice — he could work for more than one day on the same section.

"
3879,PIERO DI COSIMO,"(b. 1462, Firenze, d. 1521, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piero_co/biograph.html,"
Florentine painter, a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, whose Christian name he adopted as a patronym. There are no signed, documented, or dated works by him, and reconstruction of his oeuvre depends on the account given in Vasari's Lives. It is one of Vasari's most entertaining biographies, for he portrays Piero as a highly eccentric character who lived on hard-boiled eggs, ""which he cooked while he was boiling his glue, to save the firing"".

"
3881,"PIERRE, Jean-Baptiste-Marie","(b. 1714, Paris, d. 1789, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pierre/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker, draughtsman and administrator. Although he painted a number of rustic genre scenes and was an occasional designer of vases and picture frames, he was principally active as a painter of large-scale history and religious works. In this aspect of his output he forms a link in the 18th-century tradition of French history painting that runs from Jean Jouvenet to the Neo-classicism of Jacques-Louis David."
3882,"PIERSON, Christoffel","(b. 1631, Den Haag, d. 1714, Gouda)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pierson/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was a student of Bartholomeus Meyburgh (c. 1628-c. 1729), who was only three years older than him and with whom he travelled to Germany. Pierson had established himself in Gouda by 1654 and spent the remainder of his career there, barring an interlude between 1679 and 1691 in Schiedam, marrying a native of this city and registering in the Guild of Saint Luke there in 1685."
3883,"PIETERSZ., Aert","(b. ca. 1550, Amsterdam, d. 1612, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietersz/aert/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter, part of a family of painters. He was the second son of Pieter Aertsen, the younger brother of  Pieter Pietersz., and the older brother of Dirk Pietersz. (c. 1558-c. 1621). He was a skilled portraitist, and he painted allegories.



"
3884,"PIETERSZ, Pieter","(b. 1540, Antwerpen, d. 1603, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietersz/pieter/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter. He was the eldest son of the painter Pieter Aertsen. He was probably taught by his father. In 1574 Pietersz. was living in Haarlem where he married the daughter of a glass painter. In the early 1580s Pietersz. moved to Amsterdam where he built up a reputation. By the time he died, in 1603, he was a wealthy man. The earliest known works by Pietersz. date from 1568. At first he painted altarpieces and other large-scale works. But the Reformation put an end to this type of commission and Pietersz. began to devote his talents to portraiture. Various genre paintings by the artist are also known, such as 'Poor Parents, Rich Children', painted in 1599.



"
3885,"PIETRASANTA, Jacopo da","(active 1452, d. 1495, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietrasa/biograph.html,"
Jacopo (Giacomo) da Pietrasanta, Italian stonemason and architect. He was active in Rome in the second half of the fifteenth century. He came from a family of marble workers and masons, and worked on behalf of all the Roman Pontiffs from Nicholas V to Innocent VIII. "

Italian painter of Austrian origin, a pupil and possibly employee of Carlo Crivelli. He was mainly active in the Marches, including Ascoli Piceno, Monterubbiano, and Castel Folignano. His painting shows distinct Paduan influences."
3887,PIETRO DI DOMENICO DA MONTEPULCIANO,(active 1418-1422),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/domenic/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in the region of the Marches. He probably took his name from the village of Montepulciano in the Marches and not from the town in Tuscany. He is also called Pietro da Recanati."
3888,PIETRO DI DOMENICO DA SIENA,"(b. ca. 1457, Siena, d. ca. 1533, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/domenico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a minor Sienese painter, and his works reflect the dominant pictorial styles of the era, especially showing the influence of Bernardino Fungai, Matteo di Giovanni, Francesco di Giorgio Martini and Neroccio de' Landi. He may have trained under Benvenuto di Giovanni. The impact of Luca Signorelli and Bernardino Pinturicchio, both of whom worked in Siena for a time, is evident in Pietro's interest in landscape and the distribution in space of firmly modelled figures. A small body of attributed works has grown up around his one signed work, an Adoration of the Shepherds with SS Martin and Galganus (Siena; Pinacoteca Nazionale); its date (MCCCCC...) is now illegible. Given the large number of motifs juxtaposed by the artist in this painting and the lack of any other documentation, such attributions should be treated with caution.



"
3889,PIETRO DA FANO,(active 1452-1464 in Mantua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/fano/biograph.html,"
Italian medalist. He is known solely from recorded activities in Mantua between 1452 and 1464. He signed three medals, dating to between 1452 and 1457, that depict Lodovigo Gonzaga, marquess of Mantua, and Doge Pasquale Malipiero and his wife. Since Pietro is recorded in documents of February 1464 as still in the service of the marquess, the Malipieri medals would have been prepared during an excursion to Venice.



"

Italian painter. In a period during which commissions to Sienese painters often demanded adherence to 14th-century precedents, Pietro di Giovanni produced some of the most individual and imaginative solutions, combining local tradition with elements of progressive Florentine style. A member of the Sienese painters' guild in 1428, he had probably trained with Sassetta, whose influence on him was fundamental. Only the last ten years of his brief career are documented.



"
3891,PIETRO DA MILANO,"(b. ca. 1410, Milano, d. 1473, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/milano/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, architect and medallist (Pietro di Martino da Milano). He began his career in Dalmatia and was active at an important bottega in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) from 1431. His friendship and collaboration with the Dalmatian sculptor Francesco Laurana may have begun at this time. Many of the works produced by Pietro in Ragusa were lost in the earthquake of 1667: all that survives are the reliefs of the Small Fountain (1437-38) and the capitals of the Rector's Palace (1445), which show a restrained style with geometric, blocklike forms. Other documented works (destroyed) were the Large Fountain (1437-41), a statue for the Franciscan Monastery (1441), the fountain of the monastery of S Chiara (1449) and the Tabernacle for the monastery of S Blasio (1456)."
3892,PIETRO DA RIMINI,(active 1300-1350 in Rimini),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/rimini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His only certain work is the signed Crucifix in the Chiesa dei Morti, Urbania. In design, delicate chiaroscuro modelling and treatment of anatomy, it relates closely to one attributed to Pietro Lorenzetti (Cortona, Museo Diocesano). The heaviness of the gigantic crucified body contrasts with the fragility of the overstretched arms, enhancing the pathos of the theme. The precise, fine strokes that define the features, hair and the semi-transparent loincloth show a refined painterly technique."
3893,PIETRO DI GIOVANNI TEDESCO,(active 1386-1402 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/tedesco/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor of German origin, as indicated by his name. He is first mentioned in 1386 in Florence where he worked for the Cathedral until 1399. Between 1387-90 he carved fifteen statuettes for the portal niches of Florence Cathedral after designs by different painters - Lorenzo di Bicci, Agnolo Gaddi, Jacopo di Cione, Spinello Aretino, and perhaps others. He also worked in Milan in the Cathedral. In 1402 he was in Orvieto, where he worked on the baptismal font of the cathedral. His most famous work is the Madonna of the Rose in the niche of Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Orsanmichele in Florence."
3894,PIETRO DA VICENZA,"(b. ca. 1467, Vicenza, d. 1527, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pietro/vicenza/biograph.html,"
Italian painter who trained in the circle of Bartolomeo Montagna. In 1492 he is documented in San Vito. His collaboration with Gianfrancesco da Tolmezzo and Pietro Fuluto is verified. His principal work in Friuli is that of the frescoes in S. Pietro in Valvasone, strongly influenced by Montagna.

3895,"PIETTE, Ludovic","(b. 1826, Niort, Deux-Sèvres, d. 1877, Montfoucault)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piette/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris during the 1850s under Isidore Pils and Thomas Couture. He attended classes at the Académie Suisse and made his Salon début in 1857 with The Scorpion Broom (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen). His early works were often based on literary sources and include The Phantoms (exhibited at the 1859 Salon) and The Witches Appearing to Macbeth (exhibited at the 1861 Salon). Piette only exhibited at the Salon on two further occasions (1872 and 1876), preferring instead to sell his work at auction in the Hôtel Drouot."
3896,"PIGALLE, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1714, Paris, d. 1785, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pigalle/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied under Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne and then in Rome (1736-39). In this early career he endured poverty and sickness (his studies in Rome were made at his own expense and he walked there from Paris), but after he was received into the Académie Royale in 1744 with his rapturously acclaimed Mercury (Louvre, Paris, terracotta model in the Metropolitan Museum, New York), he rapidly went on to become the most successful French sculptor of his period. He was a superb craftsman and highly versatile and inventive, equally adept at small genre pieces and the most grandiloquent tomb sculpture. As a portraitist he was noted for his warmth and vivacity. His most famous works are the startling nude figure of Voltaire (Institut de France, Paris, 1770-76) and the spectacular and majestic tomb of Maurice of Saxony (designed 1753) in St Thomas, Strasburg.



"
3897,"PIGNONI, Simone","(b. 1611, Firenze, d. 1698, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pignoni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He is best known for his many pictures of voluptuous female nudes, which developed the morbidly sensual style of Francesco Furini. His Self-portrait (c. 1650; Florence, Uffizi), in which he depicts himself building up a rounded female form from a skeleton, conveys his fascination with the subject. He had an early education in Latin, followed by an apprenticeship in the workshop of the bookbinder Zanobi Pignoni, a close relative. Domenico Passignano, who frequented the workshop, suggested that Pignoni be apprenticed to Fabrizio Boschi (1570-1642), one of his own former pupils. Pignoni began to study under Boschi, but shortly moved to the workshop of Passignano and then spent a further period of study under Furini."
3898,"PILGRAM, Anton",(1455-1515),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pilgram/biograph.html,"
Austrian sculptor in Vienna who continued the tradition of Sluter, which he combined with the ornamental exuberance of the late Gothic. He was active at Heilbronn, Brno and Vienna. His masterpiece is the pulpit in the Vienna Cathedral.


"
3899,"PILLEMENT, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1728, Lyon, d. 1808, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pillemen/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. He was an extremely varied and prolific artist who became fashionable early in his career. First trained by Daniel Sarrabat in Lyon, Pillement received a good grounding in the Rococo style of genre painting exemplified in the work of Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. After a brief spell at the Gobelins, in 1745 he left for Madrid. He stayed there for three years, and his work was much appreciated both in Spain and in Portugal, which he visited often. He supervised sets of Rococo singeries and chinoiseries painted for Quinta de Alegria, the house at Seteais, near Sintra, of the Dutch consul in Lisbon, Jan Gildemeester, and soon after he was offered the title of Painter to the King. He declined this honour and instead travelled to London. "

3901,"PILO, Carl Gustaf","(b. 1711, Runtuna, d. 1793, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pilo/biograph.html,"
Swedish portrait painter. In about 1740 he settled in Copenhagen, where he became court painter and director of the Academy, but he left for Stockholm in 1772 because of strained relations between Denmark and Sweden. He continued his success in his home country, working for the royal family and becoming director of the Academy."
3902,"PILON, Germain","(b. 1525/30, Paris, d. 1590, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pilon/biograph.html,"
The most powerful and original French sculptor of the 16th century. Early Mannerist influences on his work were displaced by a greater realism. He excelled in bronze as well as marble, both as a portrait sculptor and a medallist. He carved Francis I's tomb (1558-59) and Henry II's tomb (1564-83) at Saint-Denis, and sculptures for Fontainebleau and the Louvre and at the chateau d'Anet (for Diane de Poitiers).



"
3903,"PILOTY, Karl Theodor von","(b. 1826, München, d. 1886, Ambach bei München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piloty/biograph.html,"
German painter. He received his first training from his father, the lithographer Ferdinand Piloty (1786-1844). In 1838 Piloty entered the Munich Akademie der Bildenden Künste and from 1840 became a pupil of Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Piloty had to manage the family business after his father's death in 1844, but in 1846 he returned to the Akademie as a pupil of Karl Schorn (1801-1850). His artistic development was influenced by the work of the Antwerp artist Louis Gallait, the heightened colour and multi-figure compositions in whose history paintings especially impressed him. Besides his study of Old Masters, especially Veronese and Rubens, he was influenced by French history painters like Paul Delaroche and Horace Vernet. His history painting Seni by the Body of Wallenstein (1855; Munich, Neue Pinakothek) was an enormous success, allowing him to take a leading role in the art life of Munich. In 1860 he was ennobled. In 1874, he was appointed keeper of the Munich Academy."
3904,"PILS, Isidore-Alexandre-Augustin","(b. 1813, Paris, d. 1875, Douarnenez)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pils/biograph.html,"
French painter. The son of the painter François Pils (1785-1867), at the age of 15 he entered the studio of Guillaume Lethière, where he remained until the latter's death in 1832. He then moved to that of François-Edouard Picot, the two men rapidly becoming friends. On Picot's recommendation in 1834 Pils was commissioned to restore the paintings in the Galerie Henri II at Fontainebleau. While working there he produced several pictures of the interior of the palace and the surrounding area."

French sculptor, architect and designer. He was the son of Jean-Baptiste Pineau, Sculptor-in-ordinary to the King, and would have had considerable early contact with his father's workshop. He studied architecture with Jules Hardouin Mansart and for some time was a pupil of Germain Boffrand. After studying at the Académie de Saint-Luc he went to Lyon, where he married into a family of sculptors. He was also familiar with the workshop of the silversmith Thomas Germain, who surrounded himself with sculptors and architects."
3907,"PINO, Marco","(b. ca. 1525, Costa del Pino, Siena, d. ca. 1587, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Marco da Siena. He was an apprentice of Domenico Beccafumi in Siena (1537-42), and by 1543 was in Rome. His Mannerist formula was already evident in the Visitation (1545; Rome, Santo Spirito in Sassia). Through his collaborations with Perino del Vaga on frescoes in the Castel Sant'Angelo (1546) and Daniele da Volterra on frescoes in Trinità de' Monti (1548-53), he combined the grace of Perino with the twisting poses of Michelangelo."
3908,PINTURICCHIO,"(b. ca. 1454, Perugia, d. 1513, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pinturic/biograph.html,"Bernardino di Betto (Benedetto), Italian painter called II Pinturicchio, was, like Perugino, a native of the district around Perugia and consequently open to the artistic currents common to the Umbrian region. His training and early career are completely unknown; even his date of birth is a matter of speculation. Usually considered to have been born around 1454 on the basis of ambiguous data given by Vasari, he was more likely born a few years later. He was thought by his contemporaries to have been a pupil of Perugino and to have had a share in Perugino's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel in the early 1480s. Critics have also assigned to him several paintings of a series depicting events in the life of St Bernardino of Siena (Pinacoteca, Perugia), firmly datable to around 1473. This attribution is impossible on chronological grounds if the correct date of his birth is about 1460.

"
3909,"PIOLA, Domenico","(b. 1627, Genova, d. 1703, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/piola/domenico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman, printmaker and designer, part of a family of artists. He was taught to paint by his brother, Pellegro Piola (1617-40). He later worked in partnership with his younger brother, Giovanni Andrea Piola (1627-c. 1713); his three sons Paolo Gerolamo Piola, Anton Maria Piola (1654-1715) and Giovanni Battista Piola (d 1725); his two sons-in-law, Gregorio de’ Ferrari and Domenico Parodi; and his brother-in-law Stefano Camogli (fl 1665-90), a specialist in arabesques of flowers and fruit. From the time of Luca Cambiaso, Genoese ceilings had consisted of rich decorative frescoes surrounded by elaborate ornament. From the latter half of the 17th century and into the early 18th century the Casa Piola came to dominate and unify the production of the various elements involved: quadratura, stucco, sculpture and painting. The workshop’s eminence in all these media enabled it to achieve an artistic monopoly that partially accounts for the decorative consistency in Genoa in the last half of the century. Large decorative projects were comprehensively prepared through drawings, progressing from careful studies of details through compositional sketches to full-scale cartoons. In their decorative projects featuring illusionistic effects the Casa Piola also designed the quadratura, which, to judge from drawings, was often as important to them as the central section of the vault. They also regarded sculpture as an integral part of the design and supplied designs for sculptors, among them Filippo Parodi, Antonio Maria Maragliano, Bernardo Schiaffino and Francesco Maria Schiaffino.

French cabinetmaker (master ébéniste). He began his career in the suburb of St. Antoine as an apprentice to the famed Migeon, and later established himself in the Marais, rue Michel-Lecomte, where he remained until his death. A majority of his works were executed in the Transition and Louis XVI period and adorned with superb quality marquetry depicting vases, cups and other vessels. Similar marquetry is found on works by his distinguished brother-in-law, Roger Vandercruse, dit Lacroix (R.V.L.C.) and Charles Topino, suggesting that all three ébéniste may have used the same talented marqueteur."

He received his sculptural training in his father's institution, working within the current Neo-classical style. In 1830 he moved to Madrid and entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. In 1832 he was named 'academico de merito', having submitted the relief the Daughter of Jephthah for his examination."

He probably came from Pontedera near Pisa (he is sometimes called Andrea da Pontedera), but he is first documented in Florence in 1330, when he received the commission to make a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery. The doors, finished in 1336, are the first of the three great sets for the Baptistery (the other two are by Ghiberti), and represent twenty scenes from the life of St John the Baptist and eight Virtues. They show a melodious line and a jeweller's refinement of execution.

In 1724 he painted an altarpiece for the church of St Helena in Deutschnofen. Probably after 1726 he went to Vienna, where he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste and became a friend of Franz Christoph Janneck.

Dutch painter, draughtsman and etcher. He is best known as a second cousin and pupil of Rembrandt. His father, master leadsmith and slater in Leiden, was married to Cornelia van Suytbroek, Rembrandt's cousin. Van der Pluym probably began his apprenticeship with Rembrandt when he was about 20. Although this is undocumented, it is likely, considering both the family relation and his Rembrandtesque style of painting. In 1648 he was a member of the newly formed Leiden Guild of St Luke; following his marriage on 30 December 1651, he became a master of the Guild, and Dean in 1654-55. He also held other public offices in Leiden, which could indicate that he saw painting only as a side-line and could also explain why his oeuvre is so limited."
3932,"PO, Giacomo del","(b. 1652, Roma, d. 1726, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/po/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was the son of Pietro del Po (1610-92), a minor painter noted for his engravings after Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Poussin; the family also included a sister, Teresa (d 1716), who was an engraver and painter of miniatures, and a stepbrother, Andrea, who was a painter."

Bernardino Poccetti (Bernardo Barbatelli), Italian painter and draughtsman. He was trained in Florence by Michele Tosini, a pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, and at 22 was admitted to the Compagnia di San Luca and later the Accademia del Disegno. His skill as a fresco painter of façades earned him the sobriquets 'Bernardino delle facciate', '...delle muse' and '...delle grottesche'. Surviving examples include the façade of the Palazzo di Bianca Capello, Florence. His six lunettes of the Life of St Dominic (c. 1582-84; Florence, S Maria Novella, Chiostro Grande) owe much to Andrea del Sarto for the clear compositions and individual figures and to the new emphasis on naturalism of Santi di Tito for the narrative simplicity."

3936,"PODESTA, Giovanni Andrea","(b. 1608, Genova, d. 1674, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/podesta/biograph.html,"
Italian etcher and painter. He is listed as being in Giovanni Battista Paggi's studio in 1627 and also studied with Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari and Domenico Fiasella before going to Rome. His work is known primarily through his etchings, printed in Rome and dated from 1636 to 1661. With few exceptions, Podesta's paintings, most of which are in France, and prints are in the style of Poussin and depict children playing amid classical objects in landscapes. The dedications on his etchings reveal his patronage and artistic circle. The etching after Titian's painting Worship of Venus (1636) is dedicated to Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657), whose archaeological interests probably played a role in Podesta's artistic development, putting him in the circle of Poussin. Three etchings (1640) concern the pleasures of wine and are dedicated to Paolo Giordano Orsini II, Prince of Bracciano, whose inventories of 1655-56 show that he owned many paintings by Podesta, including two landscapes and seven small paintings of seafood."

In 1885, accompanied by his fellow artist Józef Pankiewicz, he went to St Petersburg and studied (1885-86) at the Academy of Fine Arts. Disappointed with the conservative teaching system and short of money, he returned to Warsaw in 1886 and in 1887 continued working regularly for Tygodnik Ilustrowany, becoming one of its most popular illustrators."
3938,"POEL, Egbert van der","(b. 1621, Delft, d. 1664, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, son of a Delft goldsmith. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the first twenty-nine years of his life, not even the name of his teacher. It has been assumed but cannot be said with certainty that he resided during 1648 in the coastal town of Scheveningen, outside The Hague. The first document to shed light on his life is his registration with the Guild of St Luke in Delft in October 17, 1650; he is listed as a landscape painter. A year later he married Aeltgen Willems van Linschooten in Maasluis, near Rotterdam. The couple were living on the Doelenstraat in Delft at the time of the gunpowder explosion on October 12, 1654, as one of their daughters was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk there on October 14. Whether she was a victim of the explosion is not known. The couple had three daughters who were baptized in Delft. The baptismal records of a son indicate that the artist was living on the Rotte next to the St Joris House in Rotterdam by November 1655. He died in Rotterdam nine years later.

3940,"POELENBORCH, Simon","(b. ca. 1592, Haarlem, d. ca. 1649, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poelenbo/biograph.html,"
Simon Poelenborch (or Poelenburgh, not related to the painter Cornelis van Poelenburch, or Poelenburgh) was a Dutch engraver, one with a very small known output; he is noted chiefly for having done engravings after Esaias van de Velde. He came from a distinguished circle of artists in Haarlem. His brother, Dirck Poelenburch was also an artist. He was the brother-in-law of Jacob Matham, an engraver in Antwerp."
3941,"POELENBURGH, Cornelis van","(b. ca. 1594, Utrecht, d. 1667, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poelenbu/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, mainly of landscapes. He studied in Utrecht with Bloemaert and from about 1617 to 1625 was in Rome becoming one of the leading members of the first generation of Dutch painters of Italianate landscapes. His paintings are typically small scale (he often painted on copper) with biblical or mythological figures set in Arcadian landscapes, sometimes scattered with antique remnants. They are strongly influenced by Elsheimer, but cooler in colour than the German artist's work and without his sense of mystery."
3942,"POËRSON, Charles","(b. 1609, Vic-sur-Seille, d. 1667, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poerson/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a pupil of Simon Vouet, himself a highly accomplished designer of tapestries, and spent roughly five years in his studio. Poerson adopted a number of elements of the older artist's work, such as his contrapposto figures, sense of drama and movement and the play of drapery. Unfortunately many of Poerson's creations no longer survive although records state he worked on a number of important commissions with Vouet as well as independently. He received numerous commissions for religious pictures and tapestry designs from the churches and religious establishments of Paris and the surrounding region. He also contributed to projects for Anne of Austria, Queen of France (1601-1666) and her son, Louis XIV (1638-1715)."

Italian sculptor, medallist, die-engraver, goldsmith, bronze-caster and poet, part of a family of artists. Michele Poggini (1487-1527) was a gem-engraver whose two sons Giampaolo Poggini (1518-1582) and Domenico Poggini worked together in Florence as goldsmiths and gem-carvers at the court of Cosimo I de' Medici. In 1556 the two brothers were appointed die-engravers at the Florentine Mint."
3944,"POILLY, François de","(b. 1623, Abbeville, d. 1693, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poilly/biograph.html,"
French family of engravers. The brothers François de Poilly I (1623-1693) and Nicolas de Poilly (1627-1696) were sons of the Abbeville goldsmith Charles de Poilly (d. 1646). In 1638 François moved to Paris, where for three years he worked for the engraver and print-seller Pierre Daret, before working with Pierre Mariette I. From 1649 to 1656 he was in Rome. He was principally a reproductive engraver, at first producing devotional images for such print publishers as Mariette, and also book illustrations."
3945,"POIRIER, Claude","(b. ca. 1656, Paris. d. 1729, Varzy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poirier/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, who is first recorded as working in Girardon's studio. Among other sculptors he too was commissioned for statues in the gardens at Marly and Versailles (and also for the chapel there). He became a member of the Académie royale in 1703 but, with the Académie's permission, retired from Paris in 1717, settling at Auxerre. In his own parish church of Saint-Eusèbe there he executed two angels embracing the tabernacle, probably destroyed at the time of the Revolution. He may well have carried out other local work yet to be certainly identified.



"
3946,"POL, Christiaan van","(b. 1752, Berkenrode, d. 1813, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pol/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He probably learned to draw in the tavern there known as the Dorstige Kuil, where the artists from the Amsterdamse Tekenacademie would meet during the summer months. He first trained in Antwerp where he learned decorative painting. Here he met Cornelis van Spaendonck and through him, Gerard van Spaendonck and Jan Frans van Dael. He then travelled with them to Paris in 1782 where he at first spent time making decorative arabesques and painting flower arrangements in miniature on snuffbox lids. He became a good friend of Van Dael, to whom he stayed close to the rest of his life."
3947,"POLACK, Jan","(b. ca. 1450, near Kraków, d. 1519, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/polack/biograph.html,"
Painter of Polish origin, active in Bavaria. He was the most important representative of the Munich school of painting from c. 1480 to 1519. His well-developed sense of mimicry and occasionally crude manner of expression sympathetically perpetuated the traditions of Bavarian painting represented in the previous generation by the Master of the Pollinger Altar and by the Master of the Tegernsee Altar. His possible Polish origin is evident both from his name and from his close stylistic affinities with Late Gothic painting in southern Poland. He may have come to Bavaria in connection with the 'Landshut Wedding' in 1475 of George the Rich, later Duke of Bavaria-Landshut (reg 1479-1503), to Hedwig (1457-1502), the daughter of King Kasimir IV of Poland."

He also took lessons with Chistyakov, whom he considered his most important teacher, in 1871 and early 1872, after finishing his academic course. From 1863 to 1871 Polenov studied at the St Petersburg Academy of Art, where he met members of the progressive wing of the Russian artistic intelligentsia, and occasionally in the faculty of law at St Petersburg University."
3949,POLIDORO DA LANCIANO,"(b. ca. 1515, Lanciano, d. 1565, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/polidorl/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Polidoro Lanzani; Polidoro de Renzi di Lanzano; Polidoro Veneziano. Documented in Venice before 1536, he specialized in paintings showing various combinations of the Holy Family and saints in informal, outdoor settings. Although Polidoro was not a pupil of Titian, his works are closely dependent on the older master's paintings of this type and have often been mistakenly attributed to him. The Holy Family with the Infant St John the Baptist (c. 1550; Paris, Louvre) is typical of Polidoro's work. A delicately handled figure group is set in a spacious wooded landscape, where the foliage is treated with literal precision. The Christ Child leans forward to accept a lamb offered by St John. The motif was often used by Polidoro but is found earlier in Titian's Virgin and Child with St Agnes and the Infant St John the Baptist (c. 1535; Dijon, Musée des Beaux-Arts)."
3950,POLIDORO DA CARAVAGGIO,"(b. ca. 1497, Caravaggio, d. 1543, Messina)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/polidoro/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman, originally Polidoro Caldara. His surname, Caravaggio, came from his birthplace. He moved from Lombardy to Rome around 1515 and soon joined Raphael's workshop, which was then occupied with the frescoes in the Vatican Palace. A student of Raphael, he was responsible for some of the monochrome decorations in the Vatican Stanze as well as for the Loggetta of Cardinal Bernardo Bibbiena. In 1517-18 he began working with Giulio Romano and Perino del Vaga on the frescoes in the Vatican Logge of Leo X, where he can be credited with the scenes of Joseph Sold by his Brothers and the Crossing of the Jordan. He formed a close friendship with Perino and with the Spanish painter Pedro Machuca, who was also working on the Logge."

Austrian architect, active in Italy. In Vienna, Pollack attended courses at the Academy under Josef Vinzenz Fischer. After arriving in Milan in 1775, he became a pupil of Giuseppe Piermarini with whom he also collaborated. His most famous work is the Royal Villa or Villa Belgioioso, one of Milan's most important Neoclassical buildings. Clearly influenced by Palladianism and French trends, it has a rusticated base, a giant order of columns and is topped with a series of statues. Pollack also designed the English garden behind the mansion. His elevations are inspired by Ange-Jacques Gabriel's Place de la Concorde although he used Ionic rather than Corinthian columns."

In 1819, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, where he studied for five years under the Director of the Academy, Joseph Bergler. He continued his studies in Vienna with Johann Peter Krafft. Sponsored by his parents, he then moved to Rome in 1831 to complete his artistic education, studying under the painter Leopold Schutz. From 1832 he joined the circle of German-speaking artists in Rome and was a founder member of the Deutscher Kunstler Verein (Federation of German artists).  He became a naturalized citizen of Italy."

In 1846 he finally settled in Paris where he became close to the court of the Second Empire. He exhibited at the Salon between 1846 and 1856 earning the prestigious Légion d'honneur for his work in 1856. His subjects ranged broadly from historical and classical to ecclesiastical and allegorical.

Italian painter, originally Cristoforo Roncalli. After his initial training in Florence, around 1575 Pomarancio moved to Siena, where he painted an altarpiece of The Madonna and Child with Sts Anthony and Agatha (1576, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Siena) and scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Palazzo Bindi, Siena) for Ippolito Agostini. By 1582 Pomarancio was in Rome. His first major commission, two frescoes for the Oratorio del Santissimo Crocifisso at San Marcello, illustrates events from the history of the confraternity (1583-84). These frescoes, and fresco cycles depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ and the life of St Paul, respectively in the Mattei and Della Valle Chapels in Santa Maria in Aracoeli (1585-90), are still heavily indebted to late sixteenth-century Mannerism."
3959,"POMEDELLI, Giovanni Maria","(b. ca. 1478, Villafranca di Verona, d. 1537)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pomedell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, engraver, goldsmith and medalist. Probably born in Villafranca, near Verona, he was a son of Antonio di Bartolomeo. He received a substantial inheritance from his uncle in 1518 but continued to work in the arts and live in Verona. His earliest dated medal is of 1519, but he appears to have produced medals between 1511 and 1530. He signed thirteen medals and a further two medals are attributed to him. Although these latter two portray Emperor Charles V and François I, King of France, Pomedelli is not believed to have traveled outside Italy, so that the portraits must have been derived from secondary sources.

3960,"POMPEI, Alessandro, Conte","(b. 1705, Verona, d. 1772, Garda)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pompei/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, theorist, and painter. Count Alessandro Pompei studied painting under Antonio Balestra. He helped design the Villa Pindemonte a Vo at Isola della Scala in the province of Verona, and Palazzo Giuliari a Settimo di Gallese in the town of Sessino. In 1747, he designed the Oratorio delle Tre Vie, also known as the Chiesa della Rotonda (Round Church) in Sanguinetto. In Verona, he designed the Dogana, the portico of the Accademia Filarmonica, and the façade of San Paolo. In Bergamo, he designed the library of the Franciscans."
3961,"PONCE, Antonio","(b. 1608, Valladolid, d. 1677, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/ponce/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He had an undistinguished career in Madrid as a painter of still-lifes and flower-pieces. In 1624 Ponce was apprenticed to Juan van der Hamen y León, whose niece he married in 1628. The format of Ponce's compositions and some of his motifs derive from works by van der Hamen, though lacking their subtlety of composition, spatial clarity and formal conviction. In Vase of Flowers, signed and dated 1650 (Strasbourg, Musée des Beaux-Arts), Ponce's style shows laboured imitation of van der Hamen's: his dry execution results in a paradoxically airless and petrified quality."
3962,"PONCE, Jacquiot",(active 1527-1570),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/ponce_j/biograph.html,"
Jacqiot (Jacquiau; Jacquieu; Jacquin; Jacquio) Ponce (Ponsio; Ponso; Ponzio), French sculptor, stuccoist and painter. He was incorrectly identified by Vasari as Paolo Ponzio Trebatti, a Tuscan sculptor. In documents he identified himself as a French sculptor: 'Io Ponsio Francese'. He probably trained in Italy, perhaps in the circle of Francesco Primaticcio, and is named as a member of the Accademia di S Luca in Rome in 1527 and 1535. He probably returned to France in Primaticcio's retinue, collaborating with him at Fontainebleau, and in 1552 on the grotto at the château of Meudon (destroyed), near Paris, for the Duchesse d'Etampes."
3963,"PONSONELLI, Giacomo Antonio","(b. 1654, Massa, d. 1735, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/ponsonel/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He first studied with his father Giovanni Ponsonelli, a sculptor and decorator, and then with Filippo Parodi. In 1680 he married Parodi's daughter and, until the death of his father-in-law in 1702, he worked with him so closely that it is difficult to distinguish Ponsonelli's contribution to their collaborative works in Venice (1678-87), Genoa and Padua (1685-97). He was greatly influenced by the Roman Baroque, which he probably studied when he visited Rome with Parodi. His architectural decoration for Parodi's St Martha in Ecstasy (Genoa, S Marta) was inspired by Bernini's illusionistic settings, and also reflects Ponsonelli's early apprenticeship as a decorator with his father."
3964,"PONTE, Antonio da","(b. ca. 1512, Venezia, d. 1597, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/ponte/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, possibly the brother of Paolo da Ponte, architect in Padua. In 1563 Antonio da Ponte became Proto al Sal, a lifetime appointment as superintendant of public building works controlled by the Magistratura del Sale in Venice. Da Ponte was head architect of the rebuilding of the Ducal Palace that was badly damaged by fire in 1574."

3966,"PONTIUS, Paulus","(b. 1603, Antwerpen, d. 1658, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pontius/biograph.html,"
Flemish engraver. By the time he was twenty-four, he had become a master in the Antwerp guild and was the primary artist responsible for making engravings after the work of Peter Paul Rubens. In fact, Pontius lived in Rubens's home until a year after the painter's death. Having trained as a painter prior to studying engraving, Pontius developed a style ""that accurately conveys the nature of the original painting."""

Flemish-born painter and etcher of marine subjects, active in Holland. His parents moved to the northern Netherlands in 1584. His teacher was probably Hendrick Vroom. Porcellis worked in many places. He is first traceable in Rotterdam where he went bankrupt by 1615. He then moved to Antwerp. By 1622 he returned north and settled for a few years in Haarlem, then in Amsterdam, next in Voorburg near The Hague, and finally in Zoeterwoude in the environs of Leiden. The properties he amassed before his death in 1632 indicate that he had accumulated a considerable fortune during his last years."
3975,"PORCELLIS, Julius","(b. ca. 1610, Rotterdam, d. 1645, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/porcelli/julius/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter, son of Jan Porcellis. He was a pupil and follower of his father in artistic terms - their choice of subjects was similar and their signature monogram the same, but Julius's palette (often distinctively creamy, with vivid colours late in his career in an even greater departure from Jan's tonal style) is agreed to be less subtle, and his style and sense of space less fluent.

3976,PORDENONE,"(b. ca. 1484, Pordenone, d. 1539, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pordenon/biograph.html,"
Pordenone (Giovanni Antonio de Sacchis), Italian painter, named after the town of his birth, Pordenone in the Friuli, and active in various parts of northern Italy. After working in a provincial style at the very start of his career (his master is unknown and Vasari says he was self taught), by the beginning of the second decade of the 16th century he had come close to the contemporary Venetian (specifically Giorgionesque) manner of painting. In the second half of the decade, however, he was in central Italy, and his style changed under the impact particularly of Michelangelo, acquiring great weight and solidity. Pordenone was influenced also by Mantegna's illusionism and by German prints, and the style he forged from these diverse influences was highly distinctive and original. He always retained something of provincial uncouthness - at times vulgarity - but he was, in Vasari's words, 'very rich in invention . . . bold and resolute', and he excelled at dramatic spatial effects."
3977,"PORPORA, Paolo","(b. 1617, Napoli, d. 1670s, Roma or Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/porpora/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is documented as a pupil of Giacomo Recco in 1632, aged 15, and he followed Recco in becoming a specialist in still-lifes of fruit and flower subjects. According to Dominici, he also assisted in Aniello Falcone's workshop. Few of his works can be dated with certainty, and only one is signed: Flowers (private collection)."

In the 1570s Giovanni Battista worked with his brother Tomaso on the Santa Casa, Loreto. Giovanni Battista contributed the sibyls, which combine the style of antique robed figures with that of Guglielmo della Porta's female allegories from the tomb of Paul III."

Apart from the works he carried out jointly with his brother Giovanni Battista, Tomaso made two seated marble angels and gable-figures (1580) for the chapel of St Gregory in St Peter's, Rome. From 1585 he collaborated with Leonardo Sormani on a model for the bronze figure of St Peter placed on top of Trajan's Column, Rome, in 1587 (cast by Bastiano Torrigiani). The design for the figure of St Paul on the Column of Marcus Aurelius, erected in 1588, is also ascribed to him."
3983,"PORTA, Giacomo della","(b. ca. 1533, Genova, d. 1602, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/porta_g/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor. He was a pupil of Michelangelo and succeeded Vignola as architect of St. Peter's. Here he removed the temporary choir built by Bramante and with the aid of Domenico Fontana finished the dome and lantern by 1590 or 1592. He completed the plan of Il Gesù, the ground-plan and other chief architectural features of which are the work of Vignola, departing somewhat from his predecessor. In Santa Maria ai Monti, he followed the ground-plan of the church of Il Gesù. He made the façade of San Luigi de' Francesi a piece of decorative work entirely independent of the body of the structure, a method much copied later. With Carlo Maderna he built the church of San Giovanni de' Fiorentini from the designs of Sansovino. The Villa Aldobrandini in Frascati with its superb gardens shows what beautiful work della Porta could construct when free to follow his own ideas.

3984,"POSI, Paolo","(b. 1708, Siena, d. 1778, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/posi/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active mainly in Rome, but worked also in Narni, Viterbo, and Naples. His fame is mainly due to the ephemeral fake buildings erected for the fireworks of the ""Festa della Chinea"" (the white horse donated every year by the King of Naples to the Pope). These fake buildings, made of wood and papier maché, were often erected to celebrate the appointment of a cardinal or the arrival of a new ambassador. The materials used and the fact that the constructions (or machines, as they were called) lasted a few days allowed all sorts of extravagant and theatrical effects. "
3985,"POST, Frans","(b. 1612, Leiden, d. 1680, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/post/frans/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape painter, born in Leiden and active mainly in Haarlem. In 1637-44 he was a member of the Dutch West India Company's voyage of colonization to Brazil and became the first European to paint landscapes in the New World. He observed the unfamiliar flora and fauna with an appropriate freshness, creating scenes of remarkable vividness and charm, and he continued to paint Brazilian landscapes after his return to the Netherlands (indeed he is not known to have painted any other type of picture). Because of his ""naive"" style, he has been called the Douanier Rousseau of the 17th century, and he was virtually forgotten or regarded as a curiosity until the 20th century."
3986,"POST, Pieter Jansz","(b. 1608, Haarlem, d. 1669, 's Gravenhage)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/post/pieter/biograph.html,"
Pieter Post was one of the outstanding Dutch architects of the 17th century and he also occasionally painted. He was a landscapist as well as a battle painter, and is credited with painting figures in several Saenredam's architectural views, but he is better known as an architect who received commissions from the stadholders, the States General, the city of The Hague, and other municipalities in the Northern Netherlands. Pieter also designed Huis ten Bosch, Amalia van Solms's ""villa suburbana"" near The Hague. He accompanied Prince John Maurice to Brazil and created a colonial classicism at Pernambuco.

"
3987,"POT, Hendrick Gerritsz","(b. ca. 1580, Haarlem, d. 1657, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pot/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, a pupil of Karl van Mander. He probably came into contact with Frans Hals, whose large-scale genre scenes he sometimes imitated. His artistic production, however, was oriented towards portraits and small-sized genre paintings. The small genre scenes in carefully worked-out interiors show their debt to Willem Buytewech.


"
3988,"POTÉMONT, Adolphe Martial","(b. 1827, Paris, d. 1883, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/potemont/biograph.html,"
Adolphe Théodore Jules Martial Potémont, French painter and etcher. He stayed from 1847 to 1857 in La Réunion, where he signed several of his works. Inspired by his travels in the islands of the Indian Ocean, he published a series of lithographs depicting views of Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar."
3989,"POTTER, Paulus","(b. 1625, Enkhuizen, d. 1654, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/potter/paulus/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher, part of a family of painters, draughtsmen and etchers, son of Pieter Symonsz. Potter. He is celebrated chiefly for his paintings of animals. Animals appear prominently in all of Potter's works, sometimes singly but usually in small groups silhouetted against the sky, or in greater numbers with peasant figures and rustic buildings in an extensive landscape. Potter is one of the minor Dutch masters."

Theodoros Poulakis (or Pulakis), late Byzantine Greek icon painter, active in the second half of the seventeenth century. He was born in  Chania, Crete and studied under Elias Moskos in Zakynthos. He worked on church decorations also in Kaphallonia, Egina and Athens.



"
3992,"POURBUS, Frans the Elder","(b. 1545, Bruges, d. 1581, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pourbus/frans_e/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Pieter Pourbus. His work consists mainly of portraits and religious subjects, although he also executed a number of landscapes and history paintings. He worked mostly for the wealthy patrician class, and his work was instrumental in spreading the Romanism of Frans Floris (his teacher) throughout the Netherlands. It is probable that Frans Pourbus's earliest teaching was with his father in Bruges, but by 1564 he is recorded as working in the Antwerp studio of Floris. According to van Mander, Frans Pourbus and his fellow student Crispijn van den Broeck together completed an altarpiece by Floris after the latter's death in 1570."
3993,"POURBUS, Frans the Younger","(b. 1569, Antwerpen, d. 1622, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pourbus/frans_y/biograph.html,"

3994,"POURBUS, Pieter","(b. ca. 1523, Gouda, d. 1584, Brugge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pourbus/pieter/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, draughtsman, cartographer, surveyor and civil engineer. According to van Mander, who must have been a good friend, in his early youth Pieter Pourbus settled in Bruges, a prosperous town that offered excellent prospects for artists. Pourbus was registered as a (foreign) master in the Bruges Guild of St Luke in 1543 and soon emerged as the leading artist of his generation in the city. He took an active part in public life: he was involved with the rhetoricians, was a member of the archers' company of St Joris (from 1544) and was repeatedly appointed an officer in the painters' guild."
3995,"POUSSIN, Nicolas","(b. 1594, Les Andelys, d. 1665, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poussin/biograph.html,"
French painter, a leader of pictorial classicism in the Baroque period. Except for two years as court painter to Louis XIII, he spent his entire career in Rome. His paintings of scenes from the Bible and from Greco-Roman antiquity influenced generations of French painters, including Jacques-Louis David, J.-A.-D. Ingres, and Paul Cézanne."
3996,"POWERS, Hiram","(b. 1805, Woodstock, Vermont, d. 1873, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/powers/father/biograph.html,"
American sculptor, born in Vermont, whose first attempt at going to Italy ended in New York in 1829 when the money ran out. By 1835 his bust of Andrew Jackson brought him fame and he received many commissions for busts for the rest of his life; he finally went to Italy in 1837 and never returned to the United States."
3997,"POWERS, Longworth","(b. 1835, Cincinnati, d. 1904, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/powers/son/biograph.html,"
American photographer and sculptor. He was the eldest son of the great Neoclassical sculptor, Hiram Powers. Like his father, he was active in Florence for much of his life, yet although he had been trained in sculpture, his career was largely spent as the leading portrait photographer in Florence."
3998,"POYER, Jean",(active 1483-1503 in Tours),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/poyet/biograph.html,"
French illuminator. Poyet, who lived in Tours, France, was active from at least 1483 until his death around 1503. He was a multitalented artist - illuminator, painter, draftsman, and designer of festivals - who worked for the courts of three successive French kings: Louis XI (r. 1461-83), Charles VIII (r. 1483-98), and Louis XII (r. 1498-1515)."
3999,"POZZI, Stefano","(b. 1699, Roma, d. 1768, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pozzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. His father, Giovanni Pozzi (1672-1752), arrived in Rome c. 1690 as an innkeeper and became a renowned ivory carver. He had four sons, all artists: Rocco (1701-1774), an engraver; Andrea (1718-1769), an ivory carver; Giuseppe (1723-1765), a painter, and Stefano, the eldest, who became a pupil of the two best followers of Carlo Maratti: Andrea Procaccini until he left for Spain in 1720, then Agostino Masucci."
4000,"POZZO, Andrea","(b. 1642, Trento, d. 1709, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pozzo/biograph.html,"
Andrea Pozzo was an extraordinarily versatile artist, an architect, decorator, painter, art theoretician, one of the most significant figures of Baroque Gesamtkunst. He entered the Jesuit order at an early age, and his artistic activity is also related to the order's enormous artistic enterprises. His masterpiece, the decoration of Rome's Jesuit churches Il Gesu and Sant'Ignazio, determined for several generations the style of internal decoration of Late Baroque churches in almost all Europe. His fresco in Sant'Ignazio, with its perspective, space-enlarging illusory architecture and with the apparition of the heavenly assembly whirling above, offered an example which was copied in several Italian, Austrian and German churches of the Jesuit order. Pozzo even published his artistic ideas in a noted theoretical work entitled Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum (1693, 1698) illustrated with engravings."
4001,"PRADIER, James","(b. 1792, Genève, d. 1852, Rueil)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pradier/biograph.html,"
Swiss sculptor, painter and composer, also known as Jean-Jacques Pradier. (His birth is sometimes listed as 1790.) Prompted by his early displays of artistic talent, Pradier's parents placed him in the workshop of a jeweller, where he learnt engraving on metal. He attended drawing classes in Geneva, before leaving for Paris in 1807. By 1811 he was registered at the École des Beaux-Arts and subsequently entered its sculpture competitions as a pupil of François-Frédéric Lemot. A more significant contribution to his artistic formation around this time was the guidance of the painter François Gérard. Pradier won the Prix de Rome in 1813 and was resident at the French Academy in Rome, from 1814 until 1819."
4002,"PRANDTAUER, Jakob","(b. 1660, Stanz, d. 1726, Sankt Pölten)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/prandtau/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect. He is famed chiefly for his monastic and religious buildings, notably the abbey and church of Melk. He was the son of a master mason, and he too learned the trade. He also studied sculpture and architecture, however, for by the time he was 19 he was working as a sculptor in Sankt Pölten, a city in Lower Austria not far from Vienna. By 1700 he was a master builder (Baumeister), working on many projects in Sankt Pölten."
4003,"PRÉAULT, Antoine-Augustin","(b. 1809, Paris, d. 1879, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/preault/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, known as Auguste, one of the most important sculptors of the French Romantic movement. He was born in the working-class Marais district of Paris and was apprenticed to an ornamental carver. He later trained in the studio of Pierre-Jean David d'Angers."
4004,"PREDIS, Ambrogio de","(b. ca. 1455, Milano, d. after 1508)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/predis/ambrogio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, brother and pupil of the book illuminator Cristoforo de Predis. He belonged to Leonardo's circle of pupils. Numerous portraits have been attributed to him, in particular the family members of Lodovico Sforza, and also the well-known portrait of Emperor Maximilian in Vienna. He completed commissioned copies of some of Leonardo's paintings, but he also deserves attention as an independent artist, even although always dependent on Leonardo.

Italian illuminator, part of a family of artists. He was the brother of Ambrogio de Predis. The de Predis family hosted Leonardo da Vinci when he visited Milan for the commission Virgin of the Rocks, and Leonardo met Cristoforo on that occasion. Cristoforo was born deaf."
4006,"PREISLER, Jan","(b. 1872, Popovice u Berouna, d. 1918, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/preisler/biograph.html,"
Czech painter. He studied at the School of Applied Arts in Prague (1887-95). In 1906 he visited Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris. He taught at the Academy of Arts in Prague from 1913. He was a pioneer in modern Bohemian art, and his work developed from pure Art Nouveau and Symbolism towards Expressionism, in three phases."
4007,"PREMAZZI, Luigi","(b. 1814, Milano, d. 1891, Istambul)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/premazzi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He attended the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan and then the private school run by Giovanni Migliara (1785-1837). His early watercolours, based on the works of his master, were produced for the lithographic industry. His oeuvre is characterised by a repertoire of urban views produced in accordance with the dictates of perspective painting. While most of these are set in Milan, other Italian cities were also featured in later years. His smooth, precise painting also shows the influence of his contemporary Luigi Bisi in its descriptive focus on architectural detail. He presented work regularly at the exhibitions of the Società Promotrice di Belle Arti in Turin from 1842 to 1848 as well as those of the Brera Academy."
4008,"PRENDERGAST, Maurice Brazil","(b. 1859, St. John's, Newfoundland, d. 1924, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/prenderg/biograph.html,"
American painter, born in Canada, educated in Boston. In 1886 he worked his way to Europe on a cattle boat and studied in Paris at Julian's and at the Colarossi Academy. His brother, Charles Prendergast (1869-1948), an artist and frame maker, often assisted him financially. He again went abroad in the early 1890s, and during the rest of his life he gravitated between New York City and Europe, visiting various countries."
4009,"PRETI, Mattia","(b. 1613, Taverna Calabria, d. 1699, La Valleta)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/preti/biograph.html,"Mattia Preti (also called Il Cavaliere Calabrese) was an Italian Baroque painter. He came from Taverna in Calabria (hence his nickname) and his prolific career took him to many different parts of Italy (and according to an early biographer to Spain and Flanders). Mattia Preti left Calabria to join his brother Gregorio, also a painter, in Rome. He met with such outstanding success that within a short time he had become one of the most authoritative southern painters of the second half of the seventeenth century.

"
4010,"PRETI, Francesco Maria","(b. 1701, Castelfranco Veneto, d. 1774, Castelfranco Veneto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/preti_f/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He trained at the University of Brescia, and returned to his native city to rebuild San Liberale, the cathedral of Castelfranco. A posthumous treatise on the Elements of Architecture was printed in Venice in 1780. He also designed a theater in Castelfranco."
4011,"PREVIATI, Gaetano","(b. 1852, Ferrara, d. 1920, Lavagna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/previati/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and writer. He was one of the leading exponents of Divisionism, particularly skilled at large-scale decorative schemes, and especially important for his writings on technique and theory."
4012,"PREVITALI, Andrea","(b. ca. 1480, Berbenno di Valtellina, d. 1528, Bergamo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/prevital/biograph.html,"
Italian painter (original name Andrea Cordegliaghi). He went to Venice as a young man and there became a pupil of Giovanni Bellini, working in his shop copying Madonnas and altarpieces. He is first recorded in 1502, when he signed and dated a Virgin and Child with Donor (Museo Civico, Padua), stating in the inscription that he was a 'disciple' of Giovanni Bellini. The painting confirms this description but is exceptionally forward-looking for its date, foreshadowing Palma Vecchio and Titian in the amplitude of the forms, and perhaps reflecting Giorgione's influence in the free and painterly rendering of the landscape. In other approximately contemporary signed paintings of the Virgin and Child (such as that in the Institute of Art, Detroit), figures deriving in pose and type from Bellini are similarly set against landscapes whose darker and more sylvan character recalls Giorgione."
4013,"PREYER, Johann Wilhelm","(b. 1803, Rheydt, d. 1889, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/preyer/biograph.html,"
German painter. He studied at the Düsseldorf Kunstakademie (1822-31) and was recognized as a master of genre and flower painting by 1830. In 1835 he studied the Dutch masters at The Hague and Amsterdam; he also went on two study trips to Italy (1840 and 1842). He continued training in Munich and gradually began to expand his early, small-scale landscapes in the manner of Jan Brueghel the Elder by adding still-life motifs. By the mid-1840s he had settled on the formula that won him success: small-scale, pure still-lifes, usually of fruit. Works such as Fruit on a Porcelain Dish (1832; Nationalgalerie, Berlin) moved beyond the constraints of the traditional vanitas still-life to the joy of pure decoration."
4014,"PRIMATICCIO, Francesco","(b. 1504, Bologna, d. 1570, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/primatic/biograph.html,"
Primaticcio was the head of the First School of Fontainebleau, and a universal impresario - painter, sculptor, architect, interior decorator. He learned these arts under Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Tè at Mantua, from 1525/6 until 1532, when he was summoned to France by François I and began to work at Fontainebleau, where he met Rosso. From 1540 until 1542 he was in Rome buying for François, and on his return he found that Rosso was dead and Cellini had arrived (Cellini later threatened to kill him 'like a dog'). With Niccolò dell'Abbate he worked on the (lost) decorations of the Galérie d'Ulysse at Fontainebleau, and in 1546 he was again in Rome to get casts made, including Michelangelo's Pietà in St Peter's, while in 1563 he revisited Bologna, his native town, and met Vasari there."
4015,"PROCACCINI, Camillo","(b. ca. 1555, Bologna, d. 1629, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/procacci/camillo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, printmaker and draughtsman, son of Ercole Procaccini I. He was first mentioned in 1571 as a student in the Bolognese painters' guild when his father, Ercole I, was its head. This, and the stylistic maturity of his earliest surviving documented works, the frescoes in San Prospero, Reggio Emilia, suggest his date of birth. Trained by his father, he went to Rome c. 1580 with Conte Pirro Visconti, an important Milanese collector. His studies in Rome, particularly of the art of Taddeo Zuccaro, clearly affected his work after his return to Bologna. In 1582 he decorated the side walls of the apse of San Clemente, Collegio di Spagna, Bologna, and these frescoes (partially photographed before their destruction in 1914) seem to have been an energetic reflection of the exaggerated forms and contrasts of scale typical of mid-16th-century central Italian painting."
4016,"PROCACCINI, Carlo Antonio","(b. 1571, Bologna, d. 1630, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/procacci/carlo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, son of Ercole Procaccini. The oeuvre attributed to him comprises only a few small oil paintings, and practically nothing is known of his life. The frescoes that were documented in the cloister of the Franciscan monastery of San Angelo in Milan have been destroyed. There is documentary evidence that he was paid for his part in a cycle of scenes from the Life of St Carlo Borromeo in 1604; sources also mention a Virgin with Sts Agatha, Peter and John, signed and dated 1605."
4017,"PROCACCINI, Ercole I","(b. 1520, Bologna, d. 1595, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/procacci/ercole1/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied with Prospero Fontana and the two artists worked together in Rome in 1551. Active in Parma before 1560 and during part of that decade, in 1569 Ercole is documented back in Bologna, where a number of his altarpieces survive. The Virgin and Child with the Four Patron Saints of Bologna (1570; Bologna, San Giovanni in Monte) is a simple, symmetrical composition. Later in the 1570s his work became more sophisticated. His best-known altarpiece, the Conversion of Saul (1573; Bologna, San Giacomo Maggiore), is heavy yet elegant, reflecting the influence of central Italian Mannerism, as represented in Bologna by Lorenzo Sabbatini and Orazio Samacchini."
4018,"PROCACCINI, Ercole II","(b. 1596, Milano, d. ca. 1676, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/procacci/ercole2/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, son of Carlo Antonio Procaccini and grandson of Ercole Procaccini I. He first apprenticed with his father, then in 1621 he was enrolled in the first session of the Accademia Ambrosiana. Later he was trained with his uncle Giulio Cesare Procaccini. He painted an altarpiece of the Assumption of the Virgin for the church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Bergamo. On the death of Giulio Cesare, he became the director of the academy established by the Procaccini.



"
4019,"PROCACCINI, Giulio Cesare","(b. 1574, Bologna, d. 1625, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/procacci/giulio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and sculptor, the most distinguished member of a family of artists. He was born in Bologna and worked mainly in Milan, where the family settled when he was a child, and also in Modena and Genoa. Initially he worked mainly as a sculptor, but after about 1600 he concentrated on painting and became one of the leading painters in Milan. His style was eclectic but often very powerful, combining something of the emotional tension of Mannerism with the dynamism and sense of physical presence of the Baroque. His colours tend to be acidic, his handling of light and shade dramatic. Many of his paintings are still in Milan, but two large scenes from Christ's Passion (perhaps part of a series) are in Edinburgh and Sheffield. His father Ercole, and his brothers, Camillo and Carlo Antonio were also painters.

Russian sculptor and draughtsman. Between c. 1764 and 1779 he studied at the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg under Nicolas-François Gillet and Fyodor Gordeyev. Among his early works is a relief Ham's Damnation (plaster, 1778; St Petersburg, Academy of Arts). From 1779 to 1784 he worked in Paris in the studio of Pierre Julien and then returned to St Petersburg, where he began teaching. From 1800 he was a professor at the Academy, and in 1819 he became Senior Professor."

Jan Provo(o)st, Netherlandish painter. He was born at Mons and worked in Valenciennes and briefly in Antwerp before settling in Bruges in 1494. His style was fairly close to Gerard David, then the leading painter in Bruges, but Provost, although clumsier, was more inventive. In 1521 Provost met and entertained Dürer, who is reputed to have drawn his portrait.

French portrait and historical painter. He was trained at the Dijon Academy and in 1784 went to Rome, where he was a friend of Canova and formed his style on the example of the sfumato and sensuous charm of Leonardo and Correggio. In 1787 he returned to Paris and after working in obscurity for some time he became a favourite of both empresses of the French, Josephine and Marie-Louise, designing the decorations for the bridal suite of the latter. His friendship with the statesman Talleyrand enabled him to remain in favour even after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, but he painted little in his final years."

Italian painter, who seems to have spent most of his life in Lucca. What is known of his career is found in church records; many of his altarpieces, sculptures, and paintings have disappeared. He first appeared in these records in 1380, when he restored and painted a statue for Siena's cathedral. By 1382 he was in Lucca, where he signed an altarpiece, now lost, for a local church. He was last mentioned in 1407 in Lucca, where he was to make a mural painting of the Madonna and Child with Saints."
4027,"PUCCINELLI, Antonio","(b. 1822, Castelfranco di Sotto, d. 1897, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puccinel/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He first attended the Florence Academy under the Romantic painter Bezzuoli, before completing his studies in Rome. After his return to Florence, he successfully pursued a career as both a history and portrait painter for distinguished patrons. His approach to portraiture was similar to that of Ingres, with his sensuous linear pattern and enamel-like colouring.

Italian painter, active in Florence around the middle of the fourteenth century. One of his early works, an Annunciation with two saints in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence, also betrays the influence of Giovanni da Milano. Puccio is first recorded as a painter in 1346 when his name was included in the records of the Arte dei Medici de Speziali, the guild of doctors, druggists and painters but he is known to have been active before then since his damaged frescoes in the Strozzi Chapel in Santa Maria Novella in Florence once bore the date of 1340. In the late 1340s he executed a polyptych (now dismembered) with the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine in the centre, and representations of saints on the side panels. Some of the extant panels stand out for their lavish use of the same decorative arabesque motif which is also present in several late works by Bernardo Daddi and his shop and it is likely that the two artists were collaborating regularly by the early 1340s."
4029,"PUCELLE, Jean",(active c. 1319-1334 in Paris),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pucelle/biograph.html,"
Jean (Jehan) Pucelle was a French manuscript illuminator, master of a celebrated workshop in Paris during the 1320s. Little is known of his career, but his large workshop dominated Parisian painting in the first half of the 14th century. He enjoyed court patronage and his work commanded high prices. Certain features of his work - particularly his mastery of space - indicate that he probably travelled in Italy early in his career, and he was also familiar with Flemish developments. It was the synthesis of these two elements, allowing for an increasing penetration of naturalistic representation into traditional iconography, which formed the basis for Pucelle's individual style."
4030,"PÜCKLER-MUSKAU, Hermann von","(b. 1785, Schloss Muskau, d. 1871, Schloss Branitz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puckler/biograph.html,"
German nobleman and landscape architect. He wrote widely appreciated books, mostly about his travels in Europe and Northern Africa. After his travels he lived at Berlin and Muskau, where he spent much time in cultivating and improving the Muskau Park. In 1845 he sold this estate, and, although he afterwards lived from time to time at various places in Germany and Italy, his principal residence became Schloss Branitz near Cottbus, where he laid out another splendid park.


"
4031,"PUGA, Antonio","(b. 1602, Orense, d. 1648, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puga/biograph.html,"
Antonio Puga was a Spanish painter, assistant to Eugenio Cajes in the decoration of the Buen Retiro, a pleasure palace on the eastern border of Madrid. Here, in the Hall of Realms, the principal ceremonial room, two compositions were assigned to Cajes, but he died only four months after he started to work; his canvases were completed by his assistants Antonio Puga and Luis Fernández. A splendid if tiny number of rough-hewn scenes of everyday life has been attributed to Antonio Puga, although his authorship is far from certain.



"
4032,"PUGET, Pierre","(b. 1620, Marseille, d. 1694, Marseille)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puget/biograph.html,"The greatest French sculptor of the 17th century. He worked mainly in his native Marseille and in Toulon, for although he sought success at court, his work was much too impassioned to fit into the scheme of Le Brun's artistic dictatorship. Morover, he was arrogant and headstrong in temperament and he fell victim to the intrigues of fellow artists.

"
4033,"PUGH, Herbert",(active 1758-1788),https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pugh/biograph.html,"
Irish painter, active in England. He went to England about 1758, and in 1765 when he was living in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden, he obtained a premium of twenty-five guineas from the Society of Arts for a landscape in oil. He was a Member of the Society of Artists and contributed forty-five works to its exhibitions between 1760 and 1776, nearly all landscapes and views, but including ""The Italian and British Quack Doctors"" in 1769, ""The Amorous old Beau"" in 1772, and ""The Procuress"" in 1775. These were probably of the same nature as two or three pictures done by him in imitation of Hogarth. These pictures were engraved by Goldar. In 1777 he exhibited two works, ""The Morning Visit"" and a ""View of Covent Garden Market."""
4034,"PUGI, Guglielmo","(b. 1850, Fiesole, d. 1915)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pugi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He worked in marble and alabaster, specialising in export pieces. He directed his studio called 'Guglielmo Pugi', after joined by his sons 'Guglielmo Pugi e figli'."
4035,"PUGIN, Augustus Charles","(b. 1768, Paris, d. 1832, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pugin/augustus/biograph.html,"
English architect, illustrator, painter, draughtsman, designer and teacher. He was born in Paris, but his father was Swiss, and Pugin himself was to spend most of his life in England."
4036,"PUGIN, Augustus Welby Northmore","(b. 1812, London, d. 1852, Ramsgate)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pugin/augustuw/biograph.html,"
Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, usually A.W.N. Pugin, was an English architect, designer, author, theorist, part of a family of architects. He was a leading figure in the English Roman Catholic and Gothic revivals."
4037,"PUGIN, Edward Welby","(b. 1834, London, d. 1875, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pugin/edward/biograph.html,"
English architect, son of A. W. N. Pugin. He studied with his father and was thrust into professional and family responsibilities by the latter's early death. Initially he followed his father's Decorated Gothic style and 14th-century English church plans, but at the church of St Vincent de Paul (1856-57), Liverpool, he adopted the Geometric Gothic style, with a well-lit interior and a shallow chancel. The church of Our Lady of Reconciliation (1859-60), Liverpool, continued these stylistic and planning developments with cheaper, simplified Early French detail in contrasting stone polychromy, with a widely spaced arcade and large apsed east end, not only countering the widespread Roman Catholic criticism of Gothic Revival planning but establishing a formula for church design that was as influential among Catholics as those of his father. Sts Peter and Paul in Cork, Ireland, is a church with lavish interior; one of his largest churches is the St Colman's Cathedral (1859-1919), Cobh, Ireland. He built also several convents and colleges."
4038,"PULIGO, Domenico","(b. 1492, Firenze, d. 1527, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puligo/biograph.html,"
Domenico Puligo, actually Domenico di Bartolommeo Ubaldini, Italian painter. According to Vasari he was a pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Later he was assistant to Andrea del Sarto, in whose Roman works Domenico's hand is evident. His painting was influenced by that of Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino. In fact, he has often been attributed works that were previously believed to be by the latter two Mannerist artists. As an independent painter, he used a still softer sfumato than Andrea and, by largely dissolving the contours, and a preference for a marked chiaroscuro, achieved an expressive atmosphere. Puligo painted numerous Madonnas, for which he preferred smaller formats.



"
4039,"PULZONE, Scipione","(b. 1544, Gaeta, d. 1598, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pulzone/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is thought to have been a pupil of Jacopino del Conte in Rome. His talent was already evident in his early portraits, such as Cardinal Ricci (1569; Cambridge, Fogg Art Museum) and Cardinal Santorio (or Cardinal Granvella, 1576; London, Courtauld Institute Galleries). He was influenced by Italian court portraiture, particularly that of Raphael, and also by Flemish stylistic traits, which he must have absorbed through seeing the works (untraced) left in Rome by Antonis Mor. His brilliant palette was further enriched through contact with Venetian painting. The naturalism of the early portraits sets them apart from Mannerist portraiture; the careful rendering of details of physiognomy and dress was as important to Pulzone as expressing the personality of his sitter.



"
4040,"PUVIS DE CHAVANNES, Pierre-Cécile","(b. 1824, Lyon, d. 1898, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/puvis/biograph.html,"
French painter. He attempted to recreate something of the monumental Italian fresco style in his huge decorative canvases painted in oil, but kept flat and pale in colour and simplified in the drawing to give something of the effect of fresco. He decorated many Town Halls and other official buildings in France, the most famous being the Pantheon, Paris (1874-78, 1898, Life of St Geneviève), and the Hotel de Ville, Paris (1889-93). He was particularly admired by the artists grouped under Post-Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism as a painter of symbolical and allegorical decorations who respected the plane of the wall and composed his murals in simple areas of colour and with a rhythmic linear pattern: with Moreau and Redon he was a leading Symbolist. He decorated the Library at Boston in 1893-95.



"
4041,"PYNACKER, Adam","(b. 1620/21, Schiedam, d. 1673, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pynacker/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape painter, active mainly in Delft and in Amsterdam. He was in Italy for three years (before 1649) and he was one of the outstanding Dutch exponents of Italianate landscapes. His style resembles that of Jan Both and Jan Asselyn, but his mature work often has a distinctive and attractive silvery tonality.



"
4042,"PYNAS, Jacob","(b. 1592/95, Amsterdam, d. after 1656, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pynas/jacob/biograph.html,"Dutch painter, the fifth child of Symon Jansz. Brouwer, a wholesale merchant, who moved from Alkmaar to Amsterdam in 1590. His older brother Jan was also a painter and there has been considerable confusion in the literature about their lives as well as their work, since their styles are very similar and both signed their works J. Pynas or in monogram.

"
4043,"PYNAS, Jan","(b. 1583/84, Amsterdam, d. 1631, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/p/pynas/jan/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter who, with his brother Jacob (1585-1656), was in in Rome (c. 1605) and they returned to Holland with a new kind of history painting, much influenced by Italian ideas and also by Elsheimer. The principal importance of the brothers is that they passed these ideas on to Rembrandt, who may have been Jacob's pupil for a few months.



"
4044,"QUADAL, Martin Ferdinand","(b. 1736, Niemtschitz, Moravia, d. 1808, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quadal/biograph.html,"
Moravian painter, itinerant throughout Europe. He studied at the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna and then in 1767 in Paris; he was employed there by Louis-Joseph, Prince de Condé and was especially successful with his pictures of horses."
4045,"QUADRO, Giovanni Baptista","(d. 1590, Poznan)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quadro/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Battista Quadro (Quadrio), Italian architect, active in Poland. He came to Poland by way of Silesia, and he is first mentioned in a contract that he signed on 3 March 1550 with the Poznan Town Council for the reconstruction of the Gothic town hall, which had been severely damaged by fire in 1536. In 1552 he was appointed town architect and commissioned to design and build an extension (1552-55) to the Town Hall, which was finally completed in 1560. It was Quadro's masterpiece."
4046,"QUAGLIO, Domenico","(b. 1787, München, d. 1837, Hohenschwangau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quaglio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He was part of an Italian family of artists, active in Germany. They originally came from Laino, a small village in Valle d'Intelvi near Como. Their activity in Italy and Germany extended over eight generations; they worked as fresco painters, architects, decorators and painters of vedute and genre scenes. Eight Quaglios were stage designers who dominated the court theatres at Mannheim and Munich for five generations, as the last representatives of a great theatrical tradition that originated in Italy."
4047,"QUARENGHI, Giacomo","(b. 1744, Rota d'Imagna nr. Bergamo, d. 1817, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quarengh/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and interior designer, active in Russia. He is best known as the builder of numerous works in Russia during and immediately after the reign of Catherine II the Great. He was named ""Grand Architect of all the Russias."""
4048,"QUAST, Pieter Jansz.","(b. ca. 1605, Amsterdam, d. 1647, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quast/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, draughtsman and engraver. He became a master of the Guild of St Luke in The Hague in 1634. His paintings of groups of elegant people, such as the Merry Company (Hamburg, Kunststhalle) and Noble Company (Leipzig, Museum der Bildenden Künste), recall the work of Anthonie Palamedesz, while his scenes with soldiers, for example a Stable Interior (London, National Gallery) and Soldiers at an Inn (1640; Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle), recall the work of Pieter Codde. Usually, however, Quast painted operations and tavern scenes with peasants and beggars, whose postures and faces approach caricature, as in the Foot Operation and Card-players with a Woman Smoking a Pipe (both Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). The scenes, usually on small panels, are heavily and powerfully rendered in warm shades of brown, set off by strong local colouring in the principal figures. His successful peasant scenes are characterized by the use of strong chiaroscuro and a gentle, harmonious palette. The caricatural quality of Quast's peasants recalls the work of his fellow-resident of The Hague, Adriaen van de Venne, but Quast's looser style and many of his individual types are closer to the paintings of Adriaen Brouwer, as well as of Adriaen van Ostade, to whom Quast's best work has sometimes been ascribed."
4049,"QUEIROLO, Francesco","(b. 1704, Genova, d. 1762, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/queirolo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was a student in Genoa of Bernardo Schiaffino. Little of his early work survives. In the 1720s he settled in Rome under the protection of Cardinal Spinola and entered Giuseppe Rusconi's studio. In 1733 he received a third prize in the first class of sculpture from the Accademia di S Luca. One of his earliest signed works was a life-size marble bust of Clement XII (1730s; Florence, Galleria Corsini, Florence). He was active mainly in Naples and he delighted in carving veiled figures or figures covered by a net.

4050,"QUELLINUS, Artus I","(b. 1609, Antwerpen, d. 1668, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quellin/artus/biograph.html,"
Artus (Arnoldus) I Quellinus (or Quellin) was the most distinguished member of a family of Flemish sculptors. He was a pupil of Duquesnoy in Rome. He was back in Antwerp in 1640, then moved to Amsterdam, where from c. 1650 to 1664 he directed the sumptuous sculptural decoration of the Town Hall. His dignified style was singularly appropriate for van Campen's great building, and the decoration forms the most impressive sculptural ensemble of the time in northern Europe. The high quality of his portrait busts can be seen in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. His collaborators at Amsterdam Town Hall included his cousin, Artus II Quellinus (1625-1700), whose independent work was more Baroque in style.

Member of a Flemish family of sculptors. He was the cousin and collaborator of Artus I Quellinus at the sculptural decoration of the Town Hall in Amsterdam. His independent work was more Baroque in style. The commanding figure of God the Father (1682) for the rod screen at Bruges Cathedral is perhaps his finest work.

Flemish painter and draughtsman, part of a family of artists, son of Erasmus Quellinus II. Sandrart records that he visited Italy before becoming a master. His stay in Venice (1660-61) is particularly well documented by a drawing in the style of Veronese, representing a Madonna with Saints (1660; Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen) and also by his copies after that master and other Venetian painters, mentioned in his father's bequest (1679). In Rome he joined the Schildersbent, the confraternity of Northern painters in the city, and was given the nickname of Cederboom [cedar tree]. He became a Master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1660-61 and in 1662 married Cornelia Teniers, daughter of the painter David Teniers the Younger."

4059,"QUESTIERS, Catharina","(b. 1631, Amsterdam, d. 1669, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/questier/biograph.html,"
Dutch poet, dramatist, and engraver. Along with Cornelia van der Veer and Katharyne Lescailje she was the most successful female Dutch poet of the second half of the 17th century. Her brother David (1623-1663) also achieved some note as a poet. Catherina was not just a formidable poet and playwright. She was a very dynamic, and multitalented artist as well. She and her brother, David, etched in copper and wood, drew, sculpted, embroidered, and was skilled in the art cutting. Engravings of her hand appeared in De koddige olipodrigo (1654). These pictures illustrated some of her poems as well as the poems of her brother, David.

4060,"QUILLARD, Pierre-Antoine","(b. ca. 1700, Paris, d. 1733, Lisbon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quillard/biograph.html,"
French painter, draughtsman and engraver, active in Portugal. He received, reportedly from the age of 11, an annual pension from the Abbé de Fleury, tutor to Louis XV. He may already have started work by this time in the Paris studio of Watteau, copying his master's drawings and perhaps also painting portions of his canvases. Given Watteau's temperamental instability, it seems unlikely that he stayed there long."
4061,"QUINSA, Giovanni",(active c. 1640 in Naples),https://www.wga.hu/bio/q/quinsa/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. On the basis of a signed and dated still-life that appeared at auction in Milan in 1972, it is assumed that Quinsa was Spanish by birth, although he appears to have spent his career in Naples. The artist's oeuvre is built around a few documented works, starting with the Young Man with a Melon (destroyed), whose composition shows great restraint, in contrast to the abundance of the Kitchen Interior with Two Figures (Avila, Palacio de los Aguila), where the fruits are arranged on several horizontal and vertical planes, and grouped by shape and subject. The painter's signature there, clearly visible on a small piece of paper in the foreground, had nonetheless been doubted by some scholars.

Nicolas-Jean-Baptiste trained at the Académie de Saint-Luc. His views of Paris, especially those of the Seine, were painted with photographic precision, thus they have a documentary interest in addition to their artistic value.

In Benevento, he came to the attention of Pietro Francesco Orsini, the then archbishop of Benevento for 38 years, who in 1724 became Benedict XIII. This encounter with Orsini would be of crucial significance for Raguzzini's later career. Several churches in Benevento are attributed to Raguzzini."

He studied with Francia and learned much from Dürer's engravings in Venice (Dürer is said to have complained to the Venetian senate about being plagiarizes). In about 1510 he settled in Rome and thereafter worked mainly for Raphael, his engravings helping to spread the master's style throughout Europe. Apart from his association with Raphael, Raimondi is best known for his series of erotic engravings (after designs by Giulio Romano), that led to his imprisonment in 1524.

The father of Carlo Rainaldi, he began his career as a draughtsman in the studio of Domenico Fontana, and early works included the construction of the catafalques for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in Il Gesù (1589) and Pope Sixtus V in St Peter's (1590). He produced a scheme for the completion of St Peter's for the competition of 1607, which was won by Carlo Maderno, although Girolamo was under the patronage of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese."

Austrian painter. After his first instruction in drawing with his great-uncle Johann Heinrich, Ramberg began a course of study in philosophy at the University of Prague. During this time he also studied painting at the Academy in Prague with Franz Kadlik. In 1849 he relocated to Munich, and in 1860 went to Weimar where held a position as instructor at the newly founded Kunstschule (art school). In 1866 he returned to Munich as professor at the Academy. In contrast to the school of history painting that was inspired by Carl Theodor von Piloty, Ramberg's works take their primary inspiration from 17th century Dutch genre painting.

French sculptor and architect, active in Aix-en-Provence. In the seventeenth century Baroque developments, characterized by a taste for monumentality and trompe l'oeil, gave Aix its present appearance. Large workshops developed in which architects, painters and sculptors worked closely together. The Parisian architect Pierre Pavillon (1612-70), with the sculptor-architect Jean-Claude Rambot (1621-94) and the sculptor Jacques Fossé (1613-1703), rebuilt the Hôtel de Ville (1655-70), notable for its striking staircase consisting of twin interlocking spirals, as well as the Pavillon Vendôme (1667; enlarged 18th century)."

4083,"RAMIREZ, Felipe",(documented 1628-1631 in Toledo),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ramirez/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. Next to nothing is known about Felipe Ramírez, except that he worked in Toledo, where he was named one of the painters of the archdiocese in 1632. His only known signed and dated figurative work, Christ of the Sorrows, dating from 1631 (private collection) is a copy of an undistinguished late 16th-century painting in Toledo Cathedral. This does not prepare the viewer for his outstanding artistic performance in his still-life (Still Life with Cardoon, Francolin, Grapes and Irises, Prado, Madrid), his only known signed and dated work of this type.

Scottish portrait painter, active mainly in London. He was the outstanding portraitist there from about 1740 to the rise of Reynolds in the mid 1750s. Ramsay studied in London, in Rome, and in Naples (under Solimena), and when in 1739 he settled in London he brought a cosmopolitan air to British portrait painting. His portraits of women have a decidedly French grace (The Artist's Wife, National Gallery, Edinburgh, c. 1755) and in this field he continued to be a serious rival to Reynolds, who was upset when Ramsay was appointed Painter-in-Ordinary to George III in 1760."

French painter. The son of a painter of modest ability, Jean Ranc was trained in Paris by Hyacinthe Rigaud, the principal portraitist at the Court of Louis XIV. Rigaud himself had been a pupil of Jean's father, Antoine Ranc, and in 1715 Jean had married a niece of his master. Rigaud's flamboyant style proved to be a major influence on the portrait painters of the 18th century, and Ranc was his most competent pupil and closest disciple. He was received as an Academician in 1703 with portraits of Nicolas de Plattenberg and François Verdier, both now in Versailles, and was listed in the records of the Academy as a portraitist until his death."

His work along with that of his older contemporaries Leonardo and Michelangelo defined the High Renaissance style in central Italy. His father, Giovanni Santi, was a painter at the court of Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and doubtless taught Raphael the rudiments of technique. Giovanni was an educated man of letters and was well aware of the contemporary artists of the day. His preferences seem to have been Mantegna, Leonardo, Signorelli, Giovanni Bellini and Pietro Perugino, but he was also impressed by the Flemish artists Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. He died when his son was 11 years old. Raphael's mother supposedly cared for her infant son herself rather than sending him out to a wet nurse, and the close relationship with his parents was invoked by contemporaries as the reason for his sweet disposition. Sweet he may have been, but he was also talented to an extraordinary extent, with ambitions to match.

He studied from 1864 to 1867 with Oswald Achenbach at the Düsseldorf Academy. He began to paint various landscape designs after 1870 to satisfy the demand of tourists for pictures of fjords. He became one of the most productive fjord painters and had his greatest success in Germany. He never repeated the motives and gave each image a unique touch."

German sculptor. He was the leading German figure sculptor of the first half of the 19th century, with influence continuing beyond this time through his many pupils. His initially severe classical style was partially adapted to meet the increasing demand for realism in both appearance and mood. However, in the heroic and noble conception of his subjects, Rauch persisted in demonstrating the relevance of Classical ideals to modern concerns."

German sculptor, ivory carver and painter. The youngest child of a butcher, he is thought to have trained in the workshop of the Schenck family in Konstanz, where marble and ivory sculptures were made. He is first documented in Mainz in 1669, when it was alleged that he was practicing as a sculptor without having served a guild apprenticeship. His first surviving work, the tomb of Philipp Erwin von Schönborn (1669; Geisenheim, nr Bingen am Rhein, Heiligenkreuzkirche), is a wall tomb, a white marble relief framed in black by the aedicula, showing Schönborn and his wife kneeling before Christ and the Virgin. In the tomb the Schenck influence is still recognizable, and also that of the Zürn family in the strong, sometimes expressive gestures."

Having travelled to London in 1743-44 to engrave two of the plates for William Hogarth's Marriage à la Mode, he settled there; at that time line-engraving in London was dominated by Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Chatelain and Francis Vivares. Unlike some other successful engravers who were also print-publishers, Ravenet worked entirely for publishers, including Robert Sayer, John Boydell, John Knapton and Paul Knapton; he produced finely engraved views, book illustrations and some portraits. One of his prints, David Garrick and Miss Bellamy as Romeo and Juliet (1753), after Benjamin Wilson, was published by subscription, possibly at the painter's instigation."

He remained there until 1409, and three statues are documented as his work: the Incense-bearing Angel (1403) the Giant in Armour and St Babila (1404; all Milan Cathedral). St Babila is Raverti's best work but was criticized for departing from the design provided. His style is linked to naturalism of the Lombard Gothic tradition, tempered by proto-Renaissance traits."

His pictures, signed with the monogram H. 22., are painted in a brownish tone in the manner of Cornelis Saftleven. He left a modest oeuvre, recent research reconstructed some twenty works. He was not a very original artist, he often repeated his own compositions with very little variation. For his peasant interiors he borrowed from his townsman Aelbert Cuyp, while for still-lifes the Amsterdam still-life painter Jan Jansz. van de Velde was his starting point.

In 1832 he went to Paris to become a notary but, after discovering his love for art, studied with Jules Coignet (1798-1860) and Théodore Caruelle d'Aligny (1798-1871). Between 1840 and 1845-46 he made several trips to Rome, where he painted oil studies reminiscent of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, such as Villa at Rome (Musée du Louvre, Paris). He finally settled near Lyon (at Crémieu c. 1854; Morestel in 1868) and found his landscape subjects locally."

In 1829 he began his career as an artist, initially painting portraits of his noble relatives in Hannover and Silesia. From 1831 to 1834 he lived in Dresden, receiving numerous portrait commissions. In 1834-35, while in Paris, he was influenced by the paintings of Delacroix, Géricault and Gros. His use of colour became freer, and his compositions more dramatic and dynamic, especially in the historical subjects he attempted (e.g. Murder of Thomas Becket, c. 1835; Dresden, Gemäldegalerie)."
4102,"REBELL, Joseph","(b. 1787, Wien, d. 1828, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rebell/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied (1808-10) at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna. His early work is heavily influenced by classicism and by heroic depictions of landscape in the manner of Claude. Of decisive importance was his long stay in Italy: in Milan (1810-11), Naples (1813-15) and Rome (1816-24). Influenced by such artists who had worked in Rome as Joseph Vernet and Joseph Anton Koch, he turned to the genre of the veduta, producing such works as View from Posillipo on Capri (1821; Munich, Neue Pinakothek). However, he reached his full development as a landscape painter only after 1824, when he was appointed Director of the Imperial Picture Gallery in the Belvedere in Vienna by Emperor Francis. He held this office until his early death while on a visit to Dresden in 1828."

Italian painter, part of a family of still-life painters, father of Giuseppe Recco. He was one of the first Neapolitan still-life painters, specializing exclusively in flower subjects and in part still inspired by late Mannerism. His only dated painting is a Vase of Flowers (1626; private collection), an early work influenced by Flemish still-life painting in its accurate depiction of nature and its brilliant colours. The Vase of Flowers with the Arms of Cardinal Poli (private collection) was once attributed to Giovanni da Udine and thus held to have been painted nearly a century earlier. It confirms Recco's tendency to adopt an archaic Mannerist style, which he enriched with echoes of the highly finished detail of Flemish still-life and of the light and naturalism of the work of Caravaggio. Examples of his few known works include Vase of Flowers (private collection), probably painted after 1626 but before the pendants Vases of Flowers (private collection), one of which is initialed GR."
4105,"RECCO, Giovan Battista","(b. ca. 1615, Napoli, d. ca. 1660, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/recco/giovan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, He was probably the brother of Giacomo Recco. He is listed under the diminutive epithet 'Titta' in old inventories. His oeuvre has been discovered by scholars among paintings formerly attributed to others, in particular to Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo, who shared the same initials GBR. His development as a painter was influenced by the work of Roman Caravaggesque painters and by Spanish still-life paintings, from the genre scenes of Alejandro de Loarte and Juan van der Hamen y León to the early works of Velázquez. He may have visited Spain early in his career or could have gained his knowledge from the examples of Spanish art in Naples."
4106,"RECCO, Giuseppe","(b. 1634, Napoli, d. 1695, Alicante)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/recco/giuseppe/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of still-life painters, son of Giacomo Recco. He was the most celebrated Neapolitan still-life painter of his day. He began in the tradition of his father and (probable) uncle Giovan Battista Recco, painting naturalistic arrangements of flowers, fish, game and kitchen scenes. There are many signed and dated works which chart the development of his style. The Bodegón with a Negro and Musical Instruments (1659; private collection), the Bodegón with Fish (1664; private collection) and the Kitchen Interior (1675; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) are close to the art of Giovan Battista Recco."

Dutch painter. He was the son of Johannes Reekers the Elder (1790-1858), a painter specialising in flower and fruit pieces in addition to genre scenes and portraits. His father was his first tutor before he subsequently studied under the still-life painter Georgius van Os. Van Os, whose own style owed much to the work of the earlier Dutch master Jan van Huysum, was to exert a strong influence upon Hendrik Reekers."

He trained in François Anguier's studio and he collaborated with Michel Anguier, François Girardon and Jean-Baptiste Tuby. In 1657 he was received at the Royal Academy with an oval marble bas-relief depicting St John the Baptist, and the following year he became a professor there. In 1687, he obtained a third prize of Rome in sculpture."

4114,"REGNAULT, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1754, Paris, d. 1829, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/regnault/biograph.html,"
French painter. His first teacher was the history painter Jean Bardin, who took him to Rome in 1768. Back in Paris in 1772, he transferred to the studio of Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié. In 1776 he won the Prix de Rome with Alexander and Diogenes (Paris, Ecole National Supérieur) and returned to Rome, where he was to spend the next four years at the Académie de France in the company of Jacques-Louis David and Jean-François-Pierre Peyron. While witnessing at first hand Peyron's development of a manner indebted to Poussin and David's conversion to Caravaggesque realism, Regnault inclined first towards a Late Baroque mode in a Baptism of Christ (untraced; recorded in two sketches and an etching), then, in Perseus Washing his Hands (1779; Louisville, Speed Art Museum), to the static Neoclassicism of Anton Raphael Mengs. Until 1787 he would sign his pictures Renaud de Rome, to disassociate himself from the mannered taste of French painting before the time of David."
4115,"RÉGNIER, Nicolas","(b. 1591, Maubeuge, d. 1667, Venice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/regnier/biograph.html,"
Franco-Flemish painter, studied in the Antwerp studio of Abraham Janssens, one of the few northern painters to have been in Rome during Caravaggio's lifetime. Although Régnier's life has not been the subject of exhaustive investigation, it is clear that he was in Rome between June 1621 and 1625, and may well have arrived there as early as 1615. There is compelling evidence in his Roman work of formal contact with Bartolomeo Manfredi; their styles can be so close that some works have been misattributed. Joachim von Sandrart statement in his Teutsche Academie of 1675-79 that in Italy Régnier followed the method of Manfredi supports an association. Sandrart, who met Régnier, also reported that he became a member of Vincenzo Giustiniani's household. Régnier served as Giustiniani's official painter, and as many as nine of his works are recorded in the Giustiniani collection. In Rome Régnier was also in close contact with other French Caravaggisti, particularly Simon Vouet."

German painter and draughtsman. He attended school in Lübeck, then began studying law in Heidelberg. During 1813-16 he lived in Vienna, taking drawing-lessons from Joseph Sutter (1781-1866) and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. In 1816 he went to Rome, where his brother-in-law, Friedrich Overbeck, was already established. Rehbenitz made friends with Friedrich Olivier and shared accommodation with him and Schnorr von Carolsfeld in the Palazzo Caffarelli; this earned the three of them the nickname of the 'Kapitoliner'. Unlike many of the Nazarenes, Rehbenitz kept his Protestant faith, which distinguished him from the circle around Overbeck."

He was a pupil of Giambologna in Florence between 1588 and 1595 where he was called ""Anzireccelle"". In a list of assistants of 1591 he was named as Giovanni Tedesco."
4120,"REICHLICH, Marx","(b. 1460, Salzburg, d. 1520, Salzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reichlic/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. His name, which first appeared in records of Salzburg citizens in 1494, has been linked to an artist who signed some of his paintings with the initials M R. The earliest of the initialed panels, the Adoration of the Magi with the Donor Heinrich Mentlberger (1489; Innsbruck, Tiroler Landesmuseum), suggests that Reichlich had trained with the Tyrolean artists Friedrich Pacher and Michael Pacher. The latter lived in Salzburg from 1495 to 1498, and the stylistic association with him visible in the Perckhamer Altarpiece (c. 1495-98; private collection) may account for Reichlich's having become a citizen in Salzburg. The connections with both Pachers and the fact that Reichlich received several commissions in Neustift (Novacella, nr Bressanone) suggest that his origins were in that region."
4121,"REIJSSCHOOT, Pieter Jan van","(b. 1702, Ghent, d. 1772, Ghent)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reijssch/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, who came from a family of artists in Ghent, which more or less monopolized the decoration of the city's churches, monasteries and townhouses in the 18th century. Much of this work can still be seen in situ. Pieter Jan was the first of the family's artists to make his name. He spent many years in England, where he joined the group of expatriate Flemish and Dutch artists who worked for the court or nobility.

4122,"REINAGLE, Philip","(b. 1749, Edinburgh, d. 1833, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reinagle/philip/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters. He entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1769 before becoming a pupil of Allan Ramsay, whom he assisted on various portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte and for whom he later worked as deputy. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1773 and showed largely portrait works until 1785, when he diversified into animal painting, producing such works as the watercolour Dead Pheasants (British Museum, London). From c. 1805 onwards landscapes were his dominant subject. He contributed several plates to Robert John Thornton's idiosyncratic Temple of Flora (London, 1798-1807), including those for the Blue Passion Flower and the Night Blowing Cereus, and provided drawings for the illustrations to William Taplin's Sportsman's Cabinet (London, 1803). His copies of landscapes and cattle pictures by such Dutch artists as Paulus Potter, Meindert Hobbema and Jacob van Ruisdael were often mistaken for originals."
4123,"REINAGLE, Ramsay Richard","(b. 1775, London, 1862, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reinagle/ramsay/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of a family of painters, son of Philip Reinagle. He was a pupil of his father, whose style he followed, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy as early as 1788, at the age of thirteen. After studying in Holland, he visited Italy, arriving there in 1796 and travelling as far south as Naples. Back in London, his panorama paintings were exhibited in Leicester Square by the impresario Robert Barker. Reinagle then formed a partnership with Barker's son, Thomas Edward Barker. In 1803, the two young men erected an exhibition building in the Strand where they showed a series of ten panoramas."
4124,REINER DE HUY,"(d. ca. 1150, Neufmoustier)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reiner/biograph.html,"

Reiner de Huy (Rainer of Huy), South Netherlandish metalworker. In 1125 a 'Renerus aurifaber' is mentioned in a charter of Albero I, Prince-Bishop of Liège (reg 1123–8), to the collegiate church of Huy. At the time aurifaber could refer not only to goldsmiths but also to workers in other metals (except iron). Nothing more is known of Renerus aurifaber, and no work can be attributed to him with certainty. In the middle of the 14th century, however, Jean de Warnant, a resident of the Huy region, wrote in his chronicle that a citizen of Huy named Renerus had made the famous brass baptismal font of Liège and ornamented it with a number of scenes. This assertion was repeated in the Chronicle of Liège of 1402. From the late 19th century onwards Rainer of Huy was generally considered, on the strength of these chronicles, to be the modeller and caster of the bronze font now in the church of St Barthélemy, Liège, but originally in Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, Liège, which served as the baptistery of the cathedral of St Lambert (destr. 1794)."

In 1807 he followed his brother, Friedrich Philipp Reinhold (1779-1840), who was also a painter, to Vienna, where he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste between 1807 and 1809. During the French occupation of the city in 1809, Vivant Denon brought him to Paris to work on a series of engravings about Napoleon."

He was the son of a miller. Despite the fact that he came from a family of relatively modest means, his parents took great care with his education. Rembrandt began his studies at the Latin School, and at the age of 14 he was enrolled at the University of Leiden. The program did not interest him, and he soon left to study art - first with a local master, Jacob van Swanenburch, and then, in Amsterdam, with Pieter Lastman, known for his historical paintings. After six months, having mastered everything he had been taught, Rembrandt returned to Leiden, where he was soon so highly regarded that although barely 22 years old, he took his first pupils. One of his students was the famous artist Gerrit Dou.

He was born in Bologna and began to study painting at the age of nine; he joined the Carracci Academy when he was 20. His studies were rounded off by a trip to Rome in about 1600. From that moment on, antique and recent Roman art became his ideals. He admired Raphael unconditionally. He did, however, come to terms with Caravaggio's naturalism in a group of youthful works such as The Crucifixion of St Peter in the Vatican Gallery (1604), where the use of chiaroscuro provided enormous energy.

Polish painter, active in Italy. While still very young he left Poland for Rome and Italianized his surname, Resch, to Reschi. In Rome Reschi was a pupil of Salvator Rosa and of Jacques Courtois, who inspired him to paint battle scenes and military campaigns. No works of his are known from this period. He lived in a house in Rome with the painter Pieter Mulier, called the Cavalier Tempesta (1637-1701), from 1663 to 1666. Later, except for a brief trip to Lombardy c. 1670, he settled in Tuscany, where he was a pupil of Livio Mehus and of Pietro Dandini."
4140,"RESTOUT, Jean II","(b. 1692, Rouen, d. 1768, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/restout/jean2/biograph.html,"
Painter and draughtsman, the most famous member of a family of painters, with an impressively active and successful career. His father, Jean Restout I (1663-1702) was also painter. By 1707 he was in Paris as the pupil of his famous uncle, Jean Jouvenet, the leading religious painter in the capital. On 29 May 1717 Jean Restout II was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale and he was received (reçu) on 28 June 1720, the year in which he married Marie-Anne Hallé (b 1704), a daughter of the painter Claude-Guy Hallé. Unlike most history painters of his time, Restout did not travel to Italy to study. He had a solid training with Jouvenet, and perhaps also with Nicolas de Largillierre, and, once established in the 1720s, he had a studio of assistants and pupils. He occasionally attended the drawing school of the Académie, where from 1730 he was professor of drawing, in which capacity he wrote his Essai sur les principes de la peinture."
4141,"RESTOUT, Jean-Bernard","(b. 1732, Paris, d. 1797, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/restout/jeanbern/biograph.html,"

Three years later he won the first prize for his Abraham Leading Isaac to the Sacrifice (untraced), which enabled him to go to Rome. Jean-Bernard was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1765, received (reçu) in 1769 and became a professor in 1771. Between 1767 and 1791 he frequently exhibited at the Paris Salon. However, with the advent of the French Revolution in 1789, he resigned from the Académie because of admission regulations that favoured privileged candidates."
4142,"RETHEL, Alfred","(b. 1816, Diepenbend, d. 1859, Düsseldorf)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rethel/biograph.html,"
German painter and graphic artist. His biggest work, a cycle of frescos from the life of Charlemagne (Town Hall, Aachen), was once much admired as a great achievement of heroic history painting, but today seems hollow and theatrical. The cycle was begun in 1847 but left unfinished because of the madness that ended his career in 1853. Rethel is now mainly remembered for his series of woodcuts Another Dance of Death (1849), much in the spirit of Holbein's famous depictions of the subject, but satirizing the revolutionary events of 1848, with Death seen as the embodiment of anarchy. Two related woodcuts, Death as a Strangler (1847) and Death as a Friend (1851), were once extremely popular.



"
4143,"REUWICH, Erhard","(b. ca. 1455, Utrecht, d. ca. 1490, Mainz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reuwich/biograph.html,"
German painter, designer and woodcutter of Netherlandish birth. He was probably the son of the painter Hillebrant van Reewijk, who worked for the Buurkerk in Utrecht between 1456 and 1465 and in 1470 was Dean of the Utrecht guild. In 1483 Erhard accompanied Graaf Johann zu Solms-Lich, the Ritter Philipp von Bicken and Bernard von Breydenbach, chamberlain to the Archbishop of Mainz, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1486 Peregrinationes in terram sanctam, written by Breydenbach and illustrated with woodcuts by Reuwich, was published and became highly popular as a travel guide. The woodcuts, which fold out to show townscapes, including Venice and Jerusalem, made this publication technically as well as artistically an exceptional achievement. The title page, with a richly dressed Venetian lady, and other smaller woodcuts showing inhabitants of the Holy Land, are similar in style to prints by the Master of the Housebook.

In 1795 he began working in Jacques-Louis David's studio, where, with Fleury Richard, Comte Auguste de Forbin (1779-1841), François-Marius Granet and Louis Ducis (1775-1847), he belonged to what David's pupils called the 'parti aristocratique'. In 1800 he published with Forbin, who remained a friend, a comedy that was performed at the Théâtre du Vaudeville, Sterne à Paris, ou le voyageur sentimental."
4145,"REVOL, Claude-Louis-Marie","(b. 1815, Lyon, d. 1872, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/revol/biograph.html,"
French painter. A disciple of Pierre-Joseph Redouté, Revol was one of the most accomplished of the flower painters trained at the Lyon Academy. The development of the silk industry in Lyon had led directly to the establishment of a group of artists working for the Crown to provide design themes for the fabrics manufactured for the royal palaces. The foundation of the Lyon Academy solved the problem of training the artists who specialized in this genre. Although the silk industry was destroyed during the revolution, it was rebuilt by Napoleon and Josephine, the latter being the greatest patron of Redouté.

4146,"REYDAMS, Hendrik I","(b. ca. 1600, Brussel, d. 1669, Brussel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reydams/hendrik1/biograph.html,"
Flemish tapestry weaver, part of a family of tapissiers, father of Hendrik II Reydams. He became a member of the craft in 1629; he obtained a privilege in 1640. He was co-founder of the Brussels 'tapissierspand' in 1657, and dean of the craft in 1658. His tapestries included the Riding School and Life of Judith (both in Hluboka Castle) and the Life of Man (in Cotehele House). He collaborated with the Leyniers and Van der Strecken workshops on editions of Deeds of Scipio after Giulio Romano, and of the Months after Van den Hoecke.

Marinus van Reymerswale was a painter of three themes, all more or less caricatural. He painted a number of straightforward S. Jeromes, all derived from Dürer's picture of 1521 (Lisbon) but stressing the crabbedness of scholarship. The other two themes are interdependent: two exceedingly ugly and covetous Tax Gatherers and a Banker and his Wife (the banker counting his profits). The Banker is closely related to Massys's picture of the same subject, and it may be that the Tax Gatherers derive from Massys's borrowings from the caricatures of Leonardo da Vinci.
"
4149,"REYMOND, Pierre",(c. 1513- after 1584),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/reymond/biograph.html,"
French enameler. He specialized in tableware (cups, ewers, plates, dishes, etc.) decorated with mythological scenes, typically in grisaille against a dark blue background. His compositions draw particular inspiration from the work of 16th century engravers Lucas van Leyden, Albrecht Dürer, Marcantonio Raimondi, and, later in life, Bernard Salomon's (c. 1509-1561) Biblical engravings. He also made the enamelled altarpiece commissioned by Anne de Montmorency for the chapel of his Château d'Écouen (now the Musée de la Renaissance)."

Jan van Reyn (or Rijn), Flemish painter, worked in the port of Dunkirk, then still part of south-western Flanders. The young De Reyn went to Antwerp where he became a student of Van Dyck. He accompanied his master to England where he continued to assist him. After the death of Van Dyck he settled in his native town, where he painted large altarpieces, and was also employed as portrait painter.

"
4152,"RIAÑO, Diego de","(d. 1534, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riano/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. He was active in both Valladolid and Seville during the same period. In the capacity of Master of the Works (1527), he collaborated with Juan de Alava (c. 1480-1537), Francisco de Colonia (c. 1470-1542) and Juan Gil de Hontañón the Younger (active 1521-1531) and his brother Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón on the third Colegiata of Valladolid, modifying its design by setting the base of the towers on chapels with vaulted niches. A gigantic Gothic edifice, the Colegiata had a nave separated by piers from the aisles, which were lined on their other side with chapels containing vaulted niches; the building was absorbed into Valladolid Cathedral in 1580 by its architect, Juan de Herrera, although he kept to the outline of Riaño's scheme."
4153,"RIBALTA, Francisco","(b. 1565, Solsona, d. 1628, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ribalta/francisc/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was probably trained at the Escorial and during most of the 1580s and 1590s he worked in Madrid. His earlier paintings are Mannerist in character, notably his first known work, The Nailing to the Cross (Hermitage, St Petersburg, 1582). By 1599 he was settled in Valencia and there his style became much more sombre and naturalistic."
4154,"RIBALTA, Juan","(b. 1597, Madrid, d. 1628, Valencia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ribalta/juan/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, son of Francisco Ribalta. He trained in his father's workshop and followed his style closely, though his manner is freer and more vigorous. Juan's early talent is evident in the large Christ Nailed to the Cross (1615; Valencia, Museo de Bellas Artes) painted for S Miguel de los Reyes, Valencia, in which the figures of the rough executioners are taken from an Italian copy (Valencia, Colegio de Corpus Christi) of Caravaggio's Martyrdom of St Peter (1601; Rome, Santa Maria del Popolo). Juan's indirect knowledge of the Escorial painters came through his father, and he was influenced by engravings of Albrecht Dürer, but his fundamental tendency was towards naturalism. The presence of Pedro Orrente in Valencia in 1616 brought changes in Juan's style; he used warmer colours, with underpainting in red ochre, as well as more descriptive detail. This is apparent in Adoration of the Shepherds (1616; Torrente, Valencia, Parroquia de la Asunción).

Little is known of his life before he settled in Naples (at the time a Spanish possession) in 1616. Naples was then one of the main centres of the Caravaggesque style, and Ribera is often described as one of Caravaggio's followers."

French painter. After his father died in 1840, Ribot trained himself as an artist while working as a bookkeeper in Elbeuf, a small village near Rouen. In 1845 he married and moved to Paris, where he worked as a decorator of gilded frames for a mirror manufacturer and became a pupil in the studio of Auguste-Barthélémy Glaize (1807-1893). He painted architectural backgrounds for Glaize and made his own studies from the nude model."

Italian painter. He trained in Florence with Domenico Passignano and in Bologna with Guido Reni, and then travelled to Provence, to Lyon and to Paris. This period in France, of which nothing is known, ended c. 1634, when Ricchi moved to Milan and to Brescia, where his earliest surviving work, the Virgin and Saints, is in the Museo Diocesano. His style is still tentative in this but has achieved greater maturity in the St Raymund of Pennafort (1641; Bergamo, San Bartolomeo), in the Assumption of the Virgin (1644; Trento, Santa Maria Maggiore) and above all in the Massacre of the Innocents (1647; Bergamo, Santa Maria Materdomini). There, under the influence of early 17th-century Lombard art, he developed a more expressive style and more dramatic effects of chiaroscuro. In the frescoes of the Life of the Virgin (Pontoglio, parish church) he was influenced by the flamboyantly Baroque narrative style of Giovanni Giacomo Barbelli (1590-1656)."
4159,"RICCHINO, Francesco Maria","(b. ca. 1583, Milano, d. 1658, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ricchino/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He trained under Lorenzo Binago. He was patronized by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, who sent him to Rome to finish his education. In 1605, he became capomastro under the main architect of the Cathedral of the city, Aurelio Trezzi (active 1598-1616). Much later, between 1631 and 1638, Ricchino himself held this highest office to which a Milanese architect could aspire."

Italian painter, Sebastiano Ricci's nephew and pupil. He probably worked with Sebastiano in Florence in 1706-07. He may also have visited Rome and Milan, where he perhaps knew Magnasco, who influenced him. He went to England in 1708 with Pellegrini, with whom he worked on stage scenery, and in 1710 he seems to have gone back to Venice to fetch his uncle. They returned together to England in 1712, travelling via the Netherlands, and remained for about four years, arriving back in Venice c. 1717."

Italian decorative painter. He was born in Belluno and is considered a member of the Venetian school, but before he settled in Venice in 1717 he led a peripatetic life, working in numerous Italian cities (Bologna, Rome, Modena, Florence, and Parma) before going to Vienna where he worked in the Schönbrunn Palace. In 1712 he went to England with his nephew, Marco Ricci. They left in 1716, after Sebastiano failed to get the commissions to decorate the dome of St Paul's and Hampton Court Palace. He returned to Venice, and on the way home he stopped in Paris and visited Watteau, some of whose drawings he copied."

He was trained between 1449 and 1452 by Battista di Niccolò da Padova (active from 1425; d. 1452) and after Battista's death collaborated occasionally with Filippo di Matteo Torelli. Ricciardo was one of the first Florentine artists to be concerned with archaeological discoveries, and this is consistently reflected in his painting. A copy of Plautus's Comedies (Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence), datable before 1450, and belonging to Piero de' Medici, is thought to be his first autograph work."
4163,"RICCIO, Andrea","(b. ca. 1470, Trento, d. 1532, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riccio/biograph.html,"
Andrea Riccio (Andrea Briosco), Italian sculptor, active in and around Padua, where he was probably trained by Bartolommeo Bellano, who in turn is assumed to have been one of Donatello's assistants. His nickname means ""curly head""."
4164,"RICHARD, Fleury-François","(b. 1777, Lyon, d. 1852, Ecully)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richard/biograph.html,"
French painter from Lyon, a city which suffered much political upheaval during the revolution. In 1796 he went to Paris and entered the studio of Jacques-Louis David, where he rejoined fellow Lyonnais Pierre Révoil and became friends with Auguste Forbin and became friends with François-Marius Granet. These artists formed a splinter group in the studio and rejected their master's Neoclassicism in favour of subjects from modern history and literature. The Musée des Monuments Français, which preserved medieval and renaissance art and architectural artifacts from Revolutionary destruction, was a great inspiration to Richard and his fellow troubadour painters."
4165,"RICHET, Léon","(b. 1847, Solesmes, d. 1907, Fontainebleau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richet/biograph.html,"
French painter of the generation of painters raised during the height of the Barbizon school. He was a student of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pena, as well as Jules Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger. He began a Salon career in 1869, received an honourable mention in 1885 and was awarded second place medals in 1888 and 1901. However, his Barbizon-style works figure more importantly in his career than his Salon submissions."
4166,"RICHIER, Ligier","(b. ca. 1500, Saint-Mihiel, d. 1567, Genève)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richier/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. In 1530, while still resident in Saint-Mihiel, Ligier was granted exemption from taxes and paid for an unspecified task by the provostship of Koeur. In 1533, established at Saint-Nicolas-du-Port, he executed terracotta portraits of the Duc de Lorraine and members of his entourage (all lost). By the end of the year he had returned to Saint-Mihiel. In 1543 he became one of the four syndics of the town, and in 1550 he appears on the list of burghers released from guard duty at the town gates on payment of a fee."
4167,"RICHTER, Johan","(b. 1665, Tukholma, d. 1745, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richter/biograph.html,"
Johan Richter was a Swedish artist active in Venice by at least 1717 and stayed there until his death. He painted Venetian scenes of the area around St Mark's, like Carlevaris who can be considered to be his master, however, he was more original in his paintings of the lagoon proposing views unprecedented in Venetian painting. He can be seen as the forerunner of a Venetian conception of 'veduta': not as a faithful reproduction of reality, but almost as an assemblage of architectural elements.



"
4168,"RICHTER, Jakob","(d. 1571, Kalmar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richter1/biograph.html,"
German architect, active in Sweden. He came from Freiburg in Saxony, and in 1540 he was appointed architect by King Gustav I Vasa of Sweden (reg 1523-60). That year he began working at Stockholm Castle, where from 1549 to 1553 he was Master of the Works. In 1553 he went to Kalmar, south-east Sweden, initially to prepare the castle there for a royal visit and subsequently (1555) to remodel it. His architectural treatment is still evident in parts of a façade wall, which features short pilasters carrying tiers of small rounded arches, a device that can be seen in parts of eastern Europe. Richter was praised for his monumental staircases in the castles at Stockholm and Kalmar, the earliest examples in Sweden of a more spacious Renaissance design, with broad, straight flights turning at right angles and covered with barrel vaults. The two staircases at Kalmar - the King's and the Queen's - have survived.



"
4169,"RICHTER, Adrian Ludwig","(b. 1803, Dresden, d. 1884, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richtera/biograph.html,"
German painter, printmaker and illustrator. He ranks with Moritz von Schwind as the most important representative of late Romantic painting and printmaking in Germany. In contrast to the work of such leading masters of early Romanticism as Philipp Otto Runge and Caspar David Friedrich, which was ambitious in content and innovative in form, Richter's art was more modest in its aims, in line with the restrained intellectual climate of the Biedermeier period."
4170,"RICHTER, Franz Ferdinand","(b. 1693, Breslau, d. 1737)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/richterf/biograph.html,"
German Baroque painter from Silesia. The biography of Ferdinand Richter is only partially known. We know he was in Rome in 1727 where he received to go home. He was also active in Florence. An altarpiece discovered in Aschbach suggests that he also worked in the abbey of Ebrach."
4171,"RICKMAN, Thomas","(b. 1776, Maidenhead, d. 1841, Birmingham)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rickman/biograph.html,"
English architect and author. His book An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture (1817) established the classification of English medieval architecture and the use of such terms as decorated and perpendicular Gothic."
4172,"RICO Y ORTEGA, Martín","(b. 1833, El Escorial, d. 1908, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rico/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was a friend of the French landscape painter Charles-Francois Daubigny and was one of the first Spanish artists to paint his subjects in situ. He worked with his brother Bernardo Rico y Ortega (1825-1894), a copperplate engraver. He studied at the San Fernando Academy of Art in Madrid. He was successful at the exhibitions in Madrid."
4173,"RIDOLFI, Carlo","(b. 1594, Lonigo, d. 1658, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ridolfi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and art biographer. He was a pupil of the painter Antonio Vassilacchi and was active in Venice and Dalmatia. He preferred to work in the style of an earlier generation of artists, namely that of Titian and Tintoretto. In 1642 he published the biography of Tintoretto, and in 1648 he wrote an encyclopedic treatment of Venetian painting entitled Le Meraviglie dell'Arte ovvero, Le vite degli Illustri Pittori Veneti and dello Stato. He was awarded the kinghthood of the Golden Cross by Pope Innocent X, and the Venetian Republic named him a Knight of the Order of Saint Mark.



"
4174,"RIED, Benedikt","(b. ca. 1454, d. ca. 1534, Louny)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ried/biograph.html,"
Benedikt Ried (also Rejt or Rieth), German architect, active in Bohemia. There is little documented information about his life. According to some of them, he came to Prague as a military engineer to rebuild the Prague Castle fortification. He became the leading medieval architect in Bohemia who built the Vladislav Hall (1493-1515) in Prague Castle, St. Barbara's Church, Kutna Hora, (c. 1482) and other buildings in Late Gothic and early Renaissance style.



"
4175,"RIEDEL, August","(b. 1799, Bayreuth, d. 1883, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riedel/biograph.html,"
German painter. Starting 1818 Riedel studied at the Munich Academy with Robert von Langer. In 1823 he undertook his first journey to Italy. Owing to differences with the Director of the Academy, Peter von Cornelius, Riedel went to Dresden where he studied the old masters intensively. In 1832 he relocated permanently to Rome. Riedel, who is also known for his psychologically sensitive portraits, is primarily appreciated for his Italian genre scenes, which, early on, displayed a characteristically heightened and luminous coloration.



"
4176,"RIEDINGER, Georg","(b. 1568, Strasbourg, d. ca. 1628)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riedinge/biograph.html,"
German architect. He was apprenticed in 1586 to the mason and master builder Jörg Schmidt in Strasbourg, but during the upheavals of the Strassburger Bischofskrieg religious war (1592-1604) Riedinger may have left Strasbourg to travel. In 1595 he stayed at Ansbach, Bavaria, where he helped to build a fortress, possibly the one at Wülzburg, near Weissenburg (completed 1599; destroyed)."
4177,"RIEMENSCHNEIDER, Tilman","(b. ca. 1460, Osterode, d. 1531, Würzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riemensc/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, active in Würzburg, where he is first recorded in 1483. With Stoss, he was the outstanding German late Gothic sculptor, and his workshop was large and productive. He was primarily a woodcarver (he was the first German sculptor to leave the wood unpainted), but he also worked in stone. His style was intricate, but also balanced and harmonious, with none of the extreme emotionalism often seen in German art of the period. One of his masterpieces is the Altar of the Virgin (circa 1501, Creglingen, Germany), which combines relief carvings illustrating the life of the Virgin with a central sculptural representation of the Assumption. The solid, broad forms of some of his late work indicate the possible influence of Italian Renaissance sculpture, which was soon to supplant the Gothic style."
4178,"RIEPENHAUSEN, Franz","(b. 1786, Göttingen, d. 1831, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riepenha/biograph.html,"
German painter, part of a family of artists active in the 18th-19th centuries. Franz Riepenhausen and his brother Johannes (1788-1860) were early amateurs and champions of the Italian Primitives and long-standing German residents of Rome. Beginning in 1807 they entertained the notion of publishing the works of Giotto in engravings. In 1810 they published the first fascicle of a large-scale ""Geschichte der Malerei in Italien."" A series of engravings after the works of Fra Angelico and Raphael were to follow.



"
4179,"RIESENER, Henri-François","(b. 1767, Paris, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riesener/henri/biograph.html,"
French painter, son of Jean-Henri Riesener (1734-1806), French cabinetmaker of German birth. His son Léon Riesener (1808-78) was also painter, and he was the uncle of Eugene Delacroix. He specialized in portraits and was also known as a miniaturist."
4180,"RIESENER, Jean-Henri","(b. 1754, Gladbeck, d. 1806, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riesener/jean/biograph.html,"
German cabinet-maker, active in France where he was  the best-known cabinetmaker during the reign of Louis XVI. Born in the Westphalian town of Gladbeck, Riesener entered the Paris workshop of his fellow countryman Jean-François Oeben (1721-1763) at the age of twenty-one. He married Oeben's widow in 1767, and was accepted as a master into the guild of menuisiers-ébénistes the following year. In 1774 he became Ébéniste du Roi under Louis XVI, and for the next ten years he was a principal supplier of veneered furniture to the Crown. After 1785 the royal treasury could no longer afford him, but he carried out commissions for Marie-Antoinette until the Revolution, retiring in 1800.



"
4181,"RIETSCHEL, Ernest Friedrich August","(b. 1804, Pulsnitz, d. 1861, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rietsche/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. From 1820 onwards, he studied at the Dresden Kunstakademie. In 1826 he moved to Berlin and joined the studio of Christian Daniel Rauch, with whom he was to maintain a lifelong friendship. In 1828, for his relief Penelope and Odysseus, he received a scholarship to visit Italy. He did not begin his journey until 1830, since he was first required to take part in completing Rauch's monument to Maximilian I Joseph in Munich. In the same period, he produced the figure of a potter (destroyed) for the gable decoration of the Munich Glyptothek."
4182,"RIGAUD, Hyacinthe","(b. 1659, Perpignan, d. 1743, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rigaud/biograph.html,"French portrait painter, the friend and rival of Largillière. He was born in Perpignan and after working in Montpellier he settled in Paris in 1681. His reputation was established in 1688 with a portrait (now lost) of Monsieur, Louis XIV's brother, and he became the outstanding court painter of the latter part of Louis's reign, retaining his popularity after the king's death. He was less interested in showing individual character than in depicting the rank and condition of the sitter by nobility of attitude and expressiveness of gesture. These qualities are seen most memorably in his celebrated state portrait of Louis XIV (Louvre, Paris, 1701), one of the classic images of royal majesty. Louis so admired this portrait that, although he had intended it as a present to Philip V of Spain, he kept it himself. Rigaud's unofficial portraits are much more informal and show a debt to Rembrandt (The Artist's Mother, Louvre, 1695), several of whose works he owned. The output from Rigaud's studio was vast and examples are in many collections.



"
4183,"RIGAUD, Jacques","(b. 1681, Puyloubier, d. 1754, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rigaud1/biograph.html,"
French engraver and designer. He is often confused by biographers with his brother Jean-Baptiste (active 1750s)."
4184,"RIGAUD, John Francis","(b. 1742, Torino, d. 1810, Packington Hall, Warwickshire)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rigaud_j/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in England. He studied in Turin, Florence and Bologna, and lived in Rome for two years from 1768. In 1771 he settled in London, becoming in the following year an Associate of the Royal Academy, and a full Academician in 1784."
4185,"RIGHETTI, Francesco","(b. 1749, Roma, d. 1819, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/righetti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, silversmith and bronze-founder. He quickly became a successor to his teacher Luigi Valadier, a leading Roman silversmith who also produced copies after the Antique, and responded with skill and energy to the taste of collectors for faithful replicas of celebrated statues, both ancient and modern, and antiquarian ornaments. Righetti worked on large-scale projects for popes and monarchs: he is best remembered, however, for his small bronze statuettes after famous antiquities."
4186,"RYCK, Pieter Cornelisz van","(b. 1568, Delft, d. 1628, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rijck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the pupil of Jacob Willemsz. I Delff and Huybrecht Jacobsz. He spent 15 years in Italy, then lived in Haarlem from 1604. He specialized in large kitchen interiors.


"
4187,"RIJCKHALS, Frans","(b. 1600, Middelburg, d. 1647, Middelburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rijckhal/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (other name: François Ryckhals), active in Middelburg. He was known for his small peasant scenes which included still-lifes of fruit and vegetables. Several of Rijckhals's still-lifes were formerly attributed to Frans Hals the Younger on the basis of an erroneous reading of Rijckhals complicated monogram. No signed or documented work by Frans Hals the Younger is known."
4188,"RIJN, Titus van","(b. 1641, Amsterdam, d. 1668, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rijn/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of Rembrandt and Saskia. Of the three children born previously to Rembrandt and Saskia, one died at two months, the others at two weeks. He was trained as an artist, presumably by Rembrandt."
4189,"RIJSWIJCK, Dirck van","(b. 1596, Kleve, d. after 1679, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rijswijc/biograph.html,"
Dutch goldsmith. He was presumably born in Kleve, present-day Germany but from 1622 onwards he spent his life in Amsterdam. Although trained as a goldsmith, he mostly worked on the inlay and carving of mother-of-pearl. Van Rijswijck depicted scenes on wood and Lydian stone (a black variety of jasper used as a touchstone to test the quality of gold, silver, and other precious metals). An impressive example of his work in touchstone is the octagonal table-top, to which the Dutch poet Vondel dedicated an ode in 1660. Dirck van Rijswijck kept the table-top for a long time in his own house, turning his workshop into an attraction for art-lovers and tourists.



"
4190,"RILEY, John",(1646-1691),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riley/biograph.html,"
English portrait painter. His early career is obscure, but he emerged as the most distinguished figure in English portraiture in the interval between the death of Lely in 1680 and the domination of Kneller. Although he was appointed Principal Painter to William III and Mary II jointly with Kneller in 1688, his finest works are not court portraits but depictions of sitters from humble callings; the best known are The Scullion (Christ Church, Oxford) and Bridget Holmes (Royal Collection, 1686), a full-length portrayal of a nonagenarian housemaid who brandishes her broom at a mischievous pageboy."
4191,"RIMINALDI, Orazio","(b. 1593, Pisa, d. 1630, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riminald/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied first with the modest Pisan painter Ranieri Borghetti (1609-1636) and then with Aurelio Lomi (1556-1622); no works from this first period survive. He then moved to Rome, where his admiration for Orazio Gentileschi, Domenichino and Bartolomeo Manfredi suggests that he probably arrived there between 1610 and 1620. He was certainly there by the beginning of 1620, for in March of that year he was commissioned by Curzio Ceuli, Master of Works of Pisa Cathedral, to paint Samson Killing the Philistines for the apse of the Cathedral (in situ). He painted also the Assumption of the Virgin (completed posthumously by his brother Girolamo) for the cathedral of Pisa. He died of the plague in 1630.

4192,"RINALDI, Antonio","(b. ca. 1709, Italia, d. 1794, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rinaldi/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Russia. One of the leading architects in St. Petersburg in the second half of the 18th century, Antonio Rinaldi had a long career that spanned the end of the Baroque period and the early years of Neoclassicism."
4193,RINALDO MANTOVANO,(active 1527-1539 in Mantua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rinaldo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. According to Vasari, he was the best pupil of Giulio Romano. He is documented in the workshop of the Palazzo del Tè in Mantua, where he collaborated on the decoration of the Sala dei Venti, the Camera delle Aquile (1527) and the Loggia di David (1531). His work with Giulio is documented from 1531, when he participated in the decoration of the Castello di San Giorgio, Mantua, for the wedding of Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and Margherita Paleologa, and in that of the apartment built for the bride in the Palazzo Ducale. From 1532 to c. 1536 he worked in the Sala dei Giganti of the Palazzo del Tè, where his somewhat flat decorative style can be identified in most of the wall paintings and part of the ceiling."
4194,"RINCÓN DE FIGUEROA, Fernando del",(active 1491-1518),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rincon/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, representative of the early Renaissance in Castile. Born in Guadalajara in the second half of the fifteenth century, Fernando Rincón worked in Zaragoza, Toledo and Guadalajara, mainly executing altarpieces for parishes and portraits for individuals."
4195,"RINCÓN, Francisco de","(b. ca. 1567, d. 1608, Valladolid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rincon1/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He played a fundamental role in the development of the new Baroque style in Castile. The sober manner of his early work evolved within the context of Roman mannerism. However, his later work is very much in keeping with contemporary trends. His innovations and creative powers, which extended to composition and iconography was very important. His early death at the age of forty represented a great loss to Spanish art."
4196,"RING, Pieter de","(b. ca. 1615, Leiden, d. 1660, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ring/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter whose style was close to Jan Davidsz. de Heem. In Leiden he was trained as a stonemason. During the day the young De Ring earned his living laying bricks and the night he drew and sketched. His grandfather provided  the funds for training with De Heem under whose guidance De Ring soon became a good artist. By 1647 he was an established master and in 1648-49 he was co-founder of the Leiden Guild of Painters."
4197,"RING, Laurits Andersen","(b. 1854, Ring, d. 1933, Sankt Jørgensbjerg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ring_lau/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. The son of a poor smallholder, he first trained as a house painter. He studied at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster, Copenhagen, under Frederik Vermehren (1823-1910) from 1874 to 1877, and then under Johan Julius Exner (1825-1910) from 1884 to 1885. In 1885 he also trained at the Kunstnernes Studieskoler under Peter Severin Krøyer."
4198,"RING, Ludger tom, the Elder","(b. 1496, Münster, d. 1547, Münster)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ring_lu/elder/biograph.html,"
German painter. The son of one Hermann Varworck, or tom Ring, he trained c. 1508-20 in the Netherlands, among other places. He designed his first woodcuts, including some bearing coats of arms, for the book printer Dietrich Tzwyfel in 1521. He became a member of the Münster painters' guild in 1533 but in February 1534, after supporting the Lutheran party in the council elections, left Münster for the Netherlands to escape the rule of the Anabaptists. This course made it easier to find work when he returned after their defeat by the Catholics, though he was passed over in appointments to offices and his son Hermann's epitaph (1548; Münster, Überwasserkirche) speaks of him receiving 'little recognition'. In 1537 he was commissioned to work for the parish of St Aegidius and Überwasser, and from 1541 for the town.



"
4199,"RING, Ludger tom, the Younger","(b. 1522, Münster, d. 1583, Brunswick)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ring_lu/younger/biograph.html,"
German painter, son of Ludger tom Ring the Elder. He proclaimed himself a Protestant, unlike his brother Hermann. He did not repudiate his family, however; he was apparently apprenticed to his father and stayed in the family home and then with Hermann until at least 1555. Evidence connects him with the painter and graphic artist Heinrich Aldegrever, another Protestant. In the 1540s he may have travelled as a journeyman in the northern Netherlands and perhaps even to England. This is indicated by a narrow half-length Self-portrait (1547; Essen, Villa Högel) showing him holding a brush and palette, inscribed with the day and hour of his birth and 31 [sic] November 1547 as the date of painting, and with words consigning his art to the praise and glory of God. A man in the background holds a letter that identifies him as Josef Hesset of the Steelyard in London, implying that Ludger had spent some time in London, where he may have been familiar with works by Holbein."
4200,"RINGUET, Pierre",(1698-1771),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ringuet/biograph.html,"
French weaver. He was the son of a master carpenter and architect who worked free lance for different workshops. He would have been the first one to introduce natural flowers in the fabric design in Lyon.

4202,"RIPANDA, Jacopo",(active 1500-1516),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ripanda/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver, born in Bologna. He went to Rome during the pontificate of Alexander VI to study classical antiquities. He constructed there an apparatus to see and make detailed drawings of the reliefs on Trajan's Column. As a consequence he received commission to decorate four rooms of the Palazzo dei Conservatori with scenes from classical history. Completed under the pontificate of Julius II, the frescoes of the Sala di Annibale and the Sala della Lupa are still partly in situ."

Hungarian painter. He studied at the Academy of Munich between 1884 and 1887; then, on a Hungarian State scholarship, be travelled to Paris; he lived in France until 1901. While in Paris, he worked in Mihály Munkácsy's studio and visited the Julian Academy. In 1889 he turned away from Munkácsy's style and, together with the Scottish painter Knowles, he moved to Neuilly near Paris. It was here that he developed his style based on the reduction of colours, characteristic of his period between 1889 and 1900. His painting My Grandmother was exhibited in the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1894. It was this picture that aroused the interest of the Nabis group (Bonnard, Denis, Vuillard) and of ""les artists intelligents"", the group of young artists gathered around the magazine ""Revue Blanche"", who invited Rippl-Rónai to join their company."
4204,"RITZOS, Andreas","(b. ca. 1422, Candia, d. ca. 1492, Crete)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ritzos/biograph.html,"
Greek icon painter, born in Heraklion on the island of Crete, the son of a goldsmith. He is considered the greatest Cretan painter of the second half of the 15th century. His works provided models for subsequent generations of icon painters. Basically he worked in the Byzantine style, but he was influenced by other styles, too, including the Italian style of painting of the 14th century. He is mentioned in documents until the year 1492. His son, Nikolaos (1446-1503) was also an icon painter.



"
4205,"RIVIÈRE, Théodore","(b. 1857, Toulouse, d. 1912, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/riviere/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied at the École des Beaux Arts under Jouffroy and Falguière, going on to spend five years working in the studio of Mercié. Rivière was one of the leading Orientalist sculptors. He not only drew on literary texts but travelled extensively in North Africa, the Far East and South America. For a time he lived in Carthage, where he completed his two Orientalist groups based on Flaubert's novel, Salammbô, published in 1862.

4206,"RIZI, Francisco","(b. 1614, Madrid, d. 1685, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rizi/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and stage designer, part of a family of artists. Francisco Rizi and his brother Fray Juan Rizi were the son of the mediocre Italian painter Antonio Ricci (d 1631) from Ancona who came to Spain with Federico Zuccaro in 1583. Juan, though primarily a painter, also wrote two theoretical treatises and worked occasionally as an architect. Francisco was a prolific artist and one of the leading exponents of Spanish High Baroque. He was also one of the most influential Spanish artists of his time and was regarded as such by contemporaries (e.g. Palomino). From his master Vicente Carducho he acquired a precision in composition, a wealth of means of expression and a love of drawing. He produced important decorative work in fresco and tempera, though few examples have survived. "
4207,"RIZZO, Antonio",(active 1465-99 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rizzo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor who made the earliest Venetian Renaissance free-standing tomb, of Orsato Giustiniani (d.1464), dismembered but known from a drawing of the whole, and fragments in New York (Metropolitan Museum), El Paso, Texas and Pavia (Cassa di Risparmio). He may have worked with Antonio Bregno on the Arco Foscari. Rizzo also made tombs for Doge Tron (S.M. dei Frari, 1476-82) and Giovanni Emo (Servi, after 1483, now also dismembered but known from a drawing). He became architect to the Doge's Palace in 1483 and at about the same time made the Adam and Eve now in the Palace. He fled Venice in 1498 after being accused of peculation, and died in Foligno.

He trained with his uncle and assisted in his workshop. In 1458 he enrolled in the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname (stone and woodworkers’ guild) as an intagliatore (carver), although he continued working with his uncle. His early works, including the altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with Saints (1466; Florence, Misericordia), reflect styles codified by Luca, which makes them difficult to identify among workshop products of the mid-15th century. The famous roundels of infants on the façade of the Foundling Hospital in Florence (1463-66) were probably made by Andrea.

Swiss painter. Robert was the most widely known and respected Swiss painter of the early 19th century. His work blends Neo-classical rigour with Romantic sentimentality and subject-matter, and he was greatly admired by both contemporary and later critics, such as Charles Clément, Théophile Thoré and Louis Viardot (1880-83), who likened him to Poussin. His reputation waned towards the end of the century, and his work was not re-evaluated until the 1970s."

He succeeded Cosmè Tura as court painter to the Este in 1486, but little is known of his life. Earlier he appears to have assisted Frencesco Cossa for some years, and with Cossa and Tura he ranks as the leading artist of the 15th century Ferrarese school. The only picture reasonably certainly his is the altarpiece with a Madonna Enthroned with Saints (1480) painted  for Santa Maria in Porto at Ravenna and now in the Brera, Milan. Other works, however, can be confidently given to him because of his distinctive style.

He worked in oil and watercolour and published lavishly illustrated books, among them the six-volume The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt & Nubia (1842-49). His work can be monotonous when seen en masse, but at his best he combines bold design with precise observation.

He later turned to still-life, gaining a substantial reputation in Belgium, the United States, and France. Famous for his fruit and floral still-lifes, he was renowned as the Master of the Rose. His tightly executed depictions of lush cultivated flowers often composed in naturalist settings gave him a distinct place in the wide school of still-life painters."

Following this he worked independently at the palace, on the Sala dello Scrutinio and the Sala del Maggiore Consiglio. His training with his father helped him in his own compositions, several of which, such as the Battle of Salvore, or the Second Conquest of Constantinople, are heroic battle themes with complex groupings and dramatic poses."

Italian sculptor. His known activity is confined to Venice. Soprani wrote that Roccatagliata fashioned models used by the aged Tintoretto to plot his compositions; this would place Roccatagliata in Venice by the mid-1580s. He is first documented, however, on 31 January 1593, when he was commissioned to make the bronze statuettes of St George and St Stephen, still on the entrance to the balustrade across the choir of San Giorgio Maggiore. This church was the centre of the artist's activity in the 1590s: twenty-two sconces in the form of putti were commissioned in 1594, another six in 1595, and two large candelabra, cast by Cesare Groppo (active c. 1596) and Giovanni Alberghetti (active c. 1600) in 1598."

In 1863 he went to work for the architectural sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, who had a great influence on him. From 1870 to 1875 he continued in the same trade in Brussels and then briefly visited Italy. In the Salon of 1877 he exhibited a nude male figure, The Age of Bronze, which was both extravagantly praised and condemned; his critics unjustly accused him of having made a cast from life. From the furore Rodin gained the active support and patronage of Turquet, undersecretary of fine arts. His Age of Bronze and St John the Baptist were purchased for the Luxembourg Gardens, Paris."
4229,"RODRÍGUEZ, Ventura","(b. 1717, Ciempozuelos, d. 1785, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rodrigue/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect. He was the son of a bricklayer. In 1727, he collaborated with his father in the work at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. He was trained by Filippo Juvarra and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti, among others.

French painter. His introduction to art came from his father, Adolphe-Eugène-Gabriel Roehn, who survived him by three years and was a successful genre painter, recording both domestic life and contemporary events and also producing a handful of troubadour paintings and many portraits. Jean-Alphonse initially had higher ambitions. He left his father to enter the École des Beaux Arts at the age of fourteen, joining the studios of Regnault and Baron Gros. Although his first exhibited works were ambitious religious subjects (for the Church of Saint Thomas Aquinas) by 1827 he had abandoned such elevated themes for more prosaic subjects from every day life."

Spanish painter of Flemish origin. He was a native of Flanders but his entire documented career took place in Spain, where he played a major role in the transition from Mannerist to Baroque painting. He is one of the most important Spanish painters of the early 17th century; his work was extremely popular in his own time. He is sometimes called the Spanish Tintoretto; there are stylistic analogies between the two. His innovative style introduced the spirit of the early Baroque into painting in Seville at the beginning of the 17th century."
4233,"ROELOFS, Willem","(b. 1822, Amsterdam, d. 1897, Berchem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/roelofs/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He is said to have made his first sketches at the age of four; at fifteen he completed his first landscape painting. Many of these early works are in the print rooms of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague. In c. 1837-38 he was apprenticed to the amateur painter Abraham Hendrik de Winter (1800-1861) in Utrecht, where the Roelofs family had moved in 1826. In 1838 he entered his first paintings in the Exhibition of Living Masters in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. In the late summer of 1840 Roelofs became a pupil of the landscape and animal painter Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen (1795-1860), with whom he made a study trip to Germany in 1841. Roelofs took a special interest in nature: he applied himself energetically both to painting and drawing, almost always selecting landscape subjects. He also studied entomology and accumulated a large collection of insects. After his training he returned to his parents in Utrecht."

Dutch painter, active in England. From 1646, when he entered the Guild of St Luke in Haarlem as a portrait painter, until 1651, he was apprenticed to Frans Hals, whose daughter, Adriaentje Hals, he married in 1654. Sometime between 1663 and 1665 he and Adriaentje went to London. Van Roestraeten was one of the more successful of the many Dutch painters who tried to make a living in England during the late seventeenth century. Peter Lely, apparently afraid of competition in the field of portraiture, offered to introduce van Roestraten to Charles II on the condition that he ceased painting portraits. Van Roestraten presumably kept his promise, for there are no further known portraits, other than self-portraits."

Flemish medallist, part of a family of medallists, engravers and goldsmiths, active in France and England. Three sons of the goldsmith and engraver Philip Roettiers (1596-1669) became leading European medallists and die-engravers; all were invited by Charles II to work at the Royal Mint in London. Jan Roettiers, Philip's oldest son took up the profession of stonecutter and medallist, with his earliest known productions being dated 1658 and 1660. He was first employed at the Antwerp Mint before moving to London in 1661 with  his brother Joseph (and subsequently with a third brother Philip). A collaboration with Thomas Simon to engrave the dies for the new milled coinage of 1662 proved unworkable, and Roettiers alone was entrusted with the commission, thereby replacing Simon at the Royal Mint. Simon's 'petition crown' of 1667 failed to reverse the decision, and Roettiers became Chief Engraver on the death of Thomas Rawlins (1670)."

Prolonged illness forced him to interrupt his studies, which he resumed in 1874 under Ferdinand Schauss (1832-1916) and Alexandre Struys (1852-1941). Through visits to Paris in the 1870s, he came into contact with the art of the Barbizon school, painting ""en plein-air"" on his return to Weimar. Under the influence of Struys he painted figurative works, such as Roman Builders (1879; Westfälisches Landesmuseum, Münster), and nudes in the tradition of academically enlightened Realism. In 1881 Rohlfs worked in a studio under Max Thedy (1858-1924)."

He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Oudry and was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1761 as a 'painter of animals and fruit'. He presented his morceau de réception, the ambitious Vase of Lapis, Ornamented with Bronze and Placed near a Globe (Paris, Louvre), in 1763. This large painting is reminiscent of Oudry's work and depicts a collection of sumptuous objects against a simple cloth backdrop."

Spanish sculptor, renowned as one of the finest sculptors in Seville in the second half of the 17th century. In his prolific output, mainly of polychrome wood figures and reliefs for retables, he was aided by his flourishing family workshop. While the influence of Andalusian sculptors such as Alonso de Mena (1587-1646), José de Arce (d. 1666), Juan Martínez Montañés and Alonso Cano is evident in some of the poses and facial expressions of Roldán's figures, they also embody a new Baroque feeling for movement and a dramatic pathos."

Italian painter. Antonio Rolli and his brother Gioseffo (Giuseppe) Rolli were quadratura painters in Bologna. Antonio studied with Angelo Michele Colonna, while Giuseppe with Domenico Maria Canuti, in the 1670s. The brothers contributed to the decoration of the church of Santi Bartolomeo e Gaetano (1686-92), and the church of San Paolo Maggiore (1695-96) in Bologna. They belonged to the quadratura painters in Bologna who produced church ceilings with a visual predominance of the painted architecture. Painters of this style (e.g. Domenico Maria Canuti and Enrico Haffner) also found their way to Rome in the second half of the seventeenth century."

Italian painter and tapestry designer. He was Pietro da Cortona's outstanding pupil, and like his master a protégé of the Barberini family. Romanelli's graceful style was less energetic than Cortona's (he owed much to his first teacher Domenichino) and his restrained type of Baroque proved particularly popular and influential in France, where he worked 1645-7 and 1655-7. He introduced to Paris Cortona's characteristic manner of decoration, consisting of paintings combined with richly gilded stuccowork, and this was one of the sources for the great schemes of Lebrun at Versailles and elsewhere. Examples of Romanelli's work survive in the Bibliothéque Nationale (painted for Cardinal Mazarin) and (much altered) in the Salle des Saisons of the Louvre (painted for Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV).

Italian sculptor. He began his training at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence under Luigi Pampaloni but was soon taught by the foremost Tuscan neoclassical sculptor, Lorenzo Bartolini. Finding Bartolini's favour, he went on to become his collaborator and, upon the master's death in 1850, the successor of his studio."
4255,ROMANINO,"(b. ca. 1484, Brescia, d. ca. 1559, Brescia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/romanino/biograph.html,"Romanino (Girolamo Romani) was an Italian painter influenced by the Venetian school. He lived in Brescia, near Milan, but travelled extensively in Northern Italy.

His early training was in Venice where he was influenced by Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, and Titian, as is evident in his Coronation of the Virgin with Saints painted for the church of Santa Giustina in Padua. He painted mainly religious subjects which include a Pietà (1510) his earliest dated work (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice)."
4256,"ROMANO, Gian Cristoforo","(b. ca. 1465, Roma, d. 1512, Loreto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/romano/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and medallist. He was the son of Isaia da Pisa. Some scholars have followed Vasari in suggesting that he was trained by his father or by Paolo Romano, but Isaia stopped work and Paolo died too early to have had any significant influence on him. It is likely that he studied with Andrea Bregno, who worked in Rome from 1446 to 1506. He may have been in Urbino before 1482, working at the Palazzo Ducale with the Lombard master Ambrogio d'Antonio Barocci. Several doorframes in the palazzo have been attributed to him. He then probably went to the Este court at Ferrara. In 1490 he carved a portrait bust of Beatrice d'Este (Paris, Louvre), the daughter of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for her betrothal to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The attribution of this bust derives from a letter of 12 June 1491 from Isabella d'Este, requesting that Ludovico send Gian Cristoforo, who had done Beatrice's portrait, to Mantua to work for her. The bust is inscribed with the imprese of a sieve surrounded by a diamond ring. The sieve was a symbol of Ludovico, the diamond of Ercole; entwined they suggest marriage and the hope of fertility. This bust is the sculpture most securely attributed to Gian Cristoforo and, with his medals, provides the basis for the assessment of his style."

Painter, a representative of Hungarian Biedermeier. He was Johann Jacob Stunder's pupil in Pest. He went to St. Petersburg to paint several portraits in the tsar's court. The standard of his works was somewhat unbalanced with attempts at more daring compositions and energetic portrayal (A.P. Ratkov, Gureev, etc.). He copied pictures in the Hermitage in 1810 to improve his art. He returned to Hungary in 1824 and worked in Eperjes  until his death. His major works: Ignác Feszler, 1824, Ferenc Kazinczy"" 1825 and G. Romlaki. He painted the altar-piece Christ and the Doubting Thomas in 1834.

In his native Antwerp he was a pupil of Janssens, an Italianate painter of merit, then from about 1616 to about 1625 he was in Italy. There his work became strongly Caravaggesque and he established himself as one of the leading Flemish exponents of the style. Later, he fell under the all-pervasive influence of Rubens and his work became much lighter in tonality.

In his portraits Romney avoided any suggestion of the character or sensibilities of the sitter. His great success with his society patrons depended largely on just this ability for dispassionate flattery.

Flemish painter and designer of tapestry cartoons, stained-glass windows and sculpture. He is first documented in 1498, as a Brother of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows, and later became court painter at Mechelen and Brussels to Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Spanish Netherlands. Jan's widely imitated tapestry designs, filled with graceful, melancholic figures set in a mixture of Late Gothic and Renaissance architecture, helped to create a uniform style in Brussels tapestries in the first quarter of the 16th century. The basis for attributing tapestries to Jan, or his workshop, is the documented series of the Story of Herkinbald (Musées Royaux d'Art & d'Histoire, Brussels), which was made for the Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament at Leuven and for the design for which Jan was paid 2.5 Rhenish guilders and some wine in 1513. His collaborators were the painter 'Philips' [Maitre Phillipe] and the weaver 'Lyeon' [Leon de Smet (active 1490-1524)]."

He began his studies at the Kunstakademi in Copenhagen in 1820. A student there for over ten years, he failed to win the major gold medal in spite of repeated attempts. His teacher was Christian August Lorentzen (1746-1828), but Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg also gave him private painting lessons. Even as a student Rorbye enjoyed some success, selling genre scenes to the royal family and portraits set in interiors to the middle classes of Copenhagen.  He exhibited at Charlottenborg most years between 1824 and 1848, and in 1849 his widow exhibited 12 of his paintings, mostly of Italian subjects."

Florentine sculptor, brother of Antonio Rossellino (1427-79). Bernardo worked as an architect as well as a sculptor and he combined both arts in his chief work - the tomb of the great humanist and Chancellor of the Florentine Republic, Leonardo Bruni, in Santa Croce, Florence (1444-50). It is based on the monument of the antipope John XXIII (Baldassare Cossa) by Donatello and Michelozzo in the Baptistery in Florence, and although less powerful, is more graceful and harmonious; the pilasters framing the serene effigy, lying on a bier, have a dignity and elegance almost worthy of Brunelleschi. It became the model for the niche tomb for the rest of the century."

Italian sculptor. Works attributed to the earliest period of his career markedly exhibit the influence of Florentine art of the mid-15th century, and it is clear that his initial training was within the environs of Florence, probably in the workshop of Bernardo Rossellino and Antonio Rossellino. He appears to have worked at San Petronio in Bologna in 1460-61, and then in Pisa in 1462, but by the late 1460s he was working in and around Florence. His baptismal font ornamented with stone reliefs in Santa Maria in Monte, near Empoli, was executed in 1468 and is his only securely dated work from this period. A marble tondo Nativity of slightly later date in the Palazzo Budini-Gattai, Florence, closely recalls, in details of its landscape and surface treatment, Rosselli's earlier oeuvre; however, it also resembles Antonio Rossellino's Nativity for the altar of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi, Naples,, and may be a copy of it.

He was documented in Neri di Bicci's workshop between May 1453 and October 1456; in 1459 he received his first known commission, for an altarpiece in Santa Trinita, Florence (untraced). It is thought that he subsequently worked with Benozzo Gozzoli, whose influence is evident in his early work, but Cosimo was receptive to the styles of almost all his more gifted contemporaries, including Alesso Baldovinetti (said by Baldinucci to have been his master), Andrea del Verrocchio and the Pollaiuolo brothers.

Italian painter. An influential artist of the early 17th century in Florence, he is described by the early sources as being of a gentle disposition and as a dedicated and dignified painter, although he lacked originality and power. His work is characterized by the simplicity, descriptive naturalism and refined colour of the Counter-Reformation art created by such Tuscan artists as Santi di Tito, Bernardino Poccetti, Lodovico Cigoli and Domenico Passignano, yet he was also responsive to Venetian and Emilian art."

Italian architect and urbanist from Ferrara. A military engineer since 1483, and the ducal architect of Ercole I d'Este, in 1492 Rossetti was assigned the project of enlarging the city of Ferrara. He designed one of the most spectacular urban developments of the fifteenth century, the Addizione Erculea, the northern extension of the city that more than doubled its area, complete with the Piazza Nuova and the intersection of the Via Prione and Via degli Angeli. Rossetti himself designed four churches and eight palazzi, including the Palazzo dei Diamanti, so called because of the diamond-pointed rustication of its façades. In the Piazza Nuova he designed the Palazzo Rondinelli and the Palazzo Strozzi-Bevilacqua (both from 1494), with arcaded ground-floors. He also designed the Church of San Francesco in the old city (from 1494) on a plan based on Brunelleschi's San Lorenzo, Florence, with a nave ceiling consisting of transverse arches supporting shallow domes on pendentives. In the Addizione he also designed the aisleless vaulted San Cristofero alla Certosa (from 1498)."

English poet and painter, son of an Italian political refugee in London. He was taught drawing by Cotman and after a few unsuccessful months with Ford Madox Brown he went to Holman Hunt in 1848. Under Hunt's guidance he painted his first major work, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, the first picture exhibited (in March 1849) with the initials of the PRB (Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood). His adherence to the tenets of the Brotherhood was, however, very shortlived."

Italian sculptor. In his native Genoa he was apprenticed to Filippo Parodi in 1680; Parodi's influence is clear in his first pre-1689 work, a Small Satyr in marble. Nearly unavoidably, he was also influenced by the work of Pierre Puget. He went to Rome in 1688, remaining there until his death; a 1692 relief of Three Men in the Fiery Furnace won first prize in all three sculpture classes at the Accademia di San Luca."

Italian medallist and gem-engraver. Beginning his career in Milan, he moved to Venice in the early 1540s and to Rome in 1546, to work for the papal mint. On stylistic grounds a medal of Pope Julius III (1550-55) is attributed to de Rossi, but his first signed medal is of Pope Marcellus II (1555). From 1557 to 1560 de Rossi resided in Florence, and in 1557 he accepted a commission to carve a large cameo showing Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and his Family (Florence, Palazzo Pitti), from a preliminary drawing (Oxford, Christ Church) attributed to Vasari; the cameo admirably displays de Rossi's technical brilliance."
4290,"ROSSI, Giovan Antonio de'","(b. 1616, Roma, d. 1695, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rossi_ga/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active mainly in Rome. Some of his works might be described as transitional between the High and Late Baroque. This is less obvious in his ecclesiastical than his secular buildings. Among his ecclesiastical works the Cappella Lancelotti in San Giovanni Laterano, built on an oval plan with projecting columns, could be mentioned. The masterpiece of his mature style is Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (1682-85), an impressive Greek cross with oval dome but without drum. Still later he built the oval chapel in the Palazzo Monte de Pietà, amply decorated with reliefs, statues, and stuccoes."

Italian printer and publisher active in Rome. He inherited the important Rome based printing business originally founded by his father, Giuseppe de Rossi (1570-1639), in 1633. It was hard work and dedication, from 1633 to 1691, that ultimately pushed the firm to the heights of its success.

Italian painter. Although Sicilian, he played little part in 18th-century Sicilian art, preferring to see himself as being at the centre of the Roman art world. However, his formative years spent firstly with Gaspare Testone (1704-1801) in Sciacca and later in Palermo with Filippo Randazzo (d. 1744), a faithful and refined pupil of Sebastiano Conca, should not be underestimated. Conca's brilliant teaching in the 1740s constituted, though indirectly, Rossi's starting-point. With the agreement of the Comune of Sciacca, he continued his apprenticeship, first at Naples in early 1750, seeking inspiration both from the tradition of Solimena and from the more brilliant and freer style of Giacomo del Po, and then later that year in Rome, where he responded to the dominant trends."

Italian sculptor. She is referred to in a document dated 1516 as the daughter of Girolamo de' Rossi of Bologna. Among the few recorded women artists in the 16th century, she was unusual in working as a sculptor. According to Vasari, she began by carving peach stones: a peach stone he described as engraved with the entire Passion has been identified as that forming part of a necklace (Pesaro, Palazzo Bonamini-Pepoli). An engraved cherry stone (Florence, Uffizi) has been attributed to her, as well as 11 carved peach stones set in a device of filigree silver (Bologna, Museo Civico)."

After military service he resumed his studies at the Brera in 1882, but he was expelled the following year for protesting against the traditional teaching methods. During this period, in which he produced his first sculptures, he was in contact with the Milanese literary and artistic avant-garde group Gli Scapigliati, which fostered in him the desire to produce naturalistic art. Rather than traditional historical, literary or allegorical themes, Rosso therefore preferred contemporary subjects: ordinary people and the destitution of modern urban life, which he captured faithfully with photographic accuracy."

He made no original engravings but transcribed on copper, by etching or with the burin, the works of Luca Penni, Raphael and Michelangelo. His most famous work is a very reduced copy of the Last Judgement by Michelangelo. In 1558 he settled in Venice, where, in the absence of Cornelis Cort, Titian entrusted him with the reproduction of several of his paintings. In the same city he also worked after Cornelis Cort and Federico Zuccaro and discovered the work of Dürer, after whom he copied the scenes of the Small Passion. In 1568 he left for Vienna, where he apparently worked as a painter and sculptor. His oeuvre comprises c. 120 prints, of which more than half are portraits.

Hans (Johann) Rottenhammer I, German painter. He travelled to Venice in 1589 and spent many years there and in Rome. In Venice he gained a reputation for small highly-finished cabinet paintings on copper, of religious and mythological subjects, combining German and Italian elements of style. In Rome he knew the members of the Bamboccianti (a circle of Northern artists). He employed Adam Elsheimer as an assistant in 1598 or 1599, and he collaborated with Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel the Elder by contributing figures to their landscapes. He was commissioned in 1600 to paint a Feast of the Gods for Emperor Rudolph II (now in The Hermitage, St. Petersburg)."
4301,"ROTTMANN, Carl","(b. 1797, Handschuhsheim, d. 1850, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rottmann/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was taught by his father the university drawing master Friedrich Rottmann (1768-1816); among his fellow students were Carl Philipp Fohr and Ernst Fries. In 1815 Rottmann painted a large watercolour, Heidelberg Castle at Sunset (Heidelberg, Kurpfälzisches Museum). The idealistic forms and romantic lighting are derived from the Scottish painter George Augustus Wallis (1770-1847) who stayed in Heidelberg from 1812 to 1816 on his return from Rome where he had been friendly with Joseph Anton Koch."
4302,"ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael","(b. 1654, Laufen, d. 1730, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rottmayr/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter and draughtsman. He is most notable for large-scale religious and secular decorative schemes, and his career heralded the important 18th-century German contribution to late Baroque and Rococo fresco painting. He was probably taught by his mother, who was a painter of wooden sculpture. Between 1675 and 1687-88 he was in Venice as a pupil and assistant of the Munich artist Johann Carl Loth, whose studio attracted many painters from Austria and southern Germany. It is possible that Rottmayr also visited other Italian cities, in particular Bologna and Rome."
4303,"ROUART, Henri Stanislas","(b. 1833, Paris, d. 1912, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rouart/biograph.html,"

4304,"ROUBILIAC, Louis-François","(b. 1705, Lyon, d. 1762, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/roubilia/biograph.html,"French-born sculptor, active in England for virtually his entire career. Little is known of his life before he settled in London in the early 1730s, although he is said to have trained under Balthasar Permoser in Saxony and Nicolas Coustou in Paris. He made his reputation with a full-length seated statue of the composer Handel (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1738), remarkable for its lively informality, and quickly became recognized as the most brilliant portrait sculptor of the day. His busts have great vivacity, stressing small forms and rippling movement in a manner very different from the broader treatment of his contemporary Michael Rysbrack.
"
4305,"ROUSSEAU, Henri","(b. 1844, Laval, d. 1910, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/roussea/biograph.html,"
French painter, called Le Douanier [the customs officer] the epithet his friends later used although he was a tax collector for more than 20 years before he retired to paint (1893). He was an ambitious, self-taught naive painter. Rousseau admired past academic artists like Bouguereau, and took direct inspiration from the Jardin des Plantes, but he was adopted by the leaders of modern art, with Apollinaire often acting as publicist. Rousseau measured Apollinaire for his portrait alongside Marie Laurencin in La Muse inspirant le poete: the resemblance is gauche yet unmistakable."
4306,"ROUSSEAU, Jacques","(b. 1630, Paris, d. 1693, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseaj/biograph.html,"
French painter, decorative artist and etcher, coming from a Huguenot family. He began his studies in Paris, and then went to Rome. His acquaintance with Herman van Swanevelt and their subsequent friendship had a considerable influence on Rousseau's career. He married Van Swanevelt's sister and rapidly gained a reputation as a skilled painter of landscapes and views. His tastefully executed works were generally decorated with architectural features, and were produced in the style of Nicolas Poussin."
4307,"ROUSSEAU, Jules-Antoine","(b. 1710, Versailles, d. 1782, Lardy)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseak/jules/biograph.html,"
French interior decorator. He worked on the interior decoration of palaces in Versailles, and in many other palaces (Bellevue, St-Cloud, Chambord, Choisy, Compiègne, Fontainebleau, Marly, and Meudon). His sons Jules-Hughes Rousseau (1743-1806) and Jean Simeon, called Jean-Simeon Rousseau de la Rottière (1747-1820), were also interior decorators.



"
4308,"ROUSSEAU, Jules-Hughes",(1743–1806),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseak/jules-h/biograph.html,"
French decorator and sculptor. Jules-Hughes Rousseau and his younger brother Jean-Siméon Rousseau de la Rottière represented the third generation of a family of decorative painters and sculptors. Creating a new style with grotesque ornament influenced by ancient Roman wall paintings, the brothers designed their painted and carved decoration together so that one complemented the other. For example, painted medallions by Jean-Siméon imitated his brother's carvings or bas-reliefs. The brothers are particularly known for their work at the palaces of Versailles and Fontainebleau.



"
4309,"ROUSSEAU, Jean-Siméon",(1747-1820),https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseak/rottiere/biograph.html,"
Jean-Siméon Rousseau, called Rousseau de la Rottière, French painter and interior decorator. He was the son of Jules-Antoine Rousseau, and continued the work of his father. In 1783 he decorated the Petits Appartements of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles, and in 1787 a games-room and a boudoir with a 'cabinet turc' at Fontainebleau for Marie-Antoinette. These rooms represent the apogée of the French 'style grotesque', and some of the motifs employed in them formed a transition to Pompeian decoration.


"
4310,"ROUSSEAU, Théodore","(b. 1812, Paris, d. 1867, Barbizon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseau/biograph.html,"
French landscape painter, the friend of Millet and Diaz, who settled at Barbizon in 1844. His aims, style and development are characteristic of the Barbizon School, of which he was one of the principal members. Like others in the group he suffered great hardship as a result of his attempts to introduce a non-academic landscape style, although this did not make him any more understanding or friendly to the Impressionists in later years. He was known as 'le grand refusé', because of his systematic exclusion from the Paris Salon between 1836 and 1841 and his abstention between 1842 and 1849."
4311,"ROUSSEAUX, Jacques de","(b. ca. 1600, Tourcoing, d. 1638, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rousseax/biograph.html,"
French painter, active in Leiden. His career was brief, his dated paintings were executed between 1630 and 1636 and he died in March 1638. During these short years Rousseaux is thought to have spent some time under Rembrandt's tutelage around 1628, and like his fellow pupils such as Gerrit Dou, Ferdinand Bol and Isaac de Jouderville, he learnt to almost perfectly repeat his masters character heads, called tronies, and came so close in reproducing Rembrandt's tonality, chromatics, and his sitter's meditative moods that modern scholarship continually faces the difficult task of separating the works of Rembrandt from those of his skilled pupils. It is true also of the opposite, that works traditionally called Rousseaux have been reattributed to Rembrandt, such as the Man with Turban."
4312,"ROUSSEL, Theodore","(b. 1847, Lorient, d. 1926, St Leonards-on-Sea)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/roussel/biograph.html,"
English painter and etcher of French birth. He was born and educated in France and settled in England in 1878, when he quickly established a reputation. Largely self-taught, his few extant early paintings show an eclectic style that combines the techniques of the Old Masters, which he studied in detail, with the subject-matter of modern urban life."
4313,"ROWLANDSON, Thomas","(b. 1756/57, London, d. 1827, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rowlands/biograph.html,"
English caricaturist, whose pre-eminence in social satire matched that of Gillray in political satire. He began as a painter, mainly of portraits, but he turned to caricature to supplement his income (he was a notorious gambler), and finding his sideline highly successful he gave his career over to it completely. His talent for exuberant and flowing line had affinities with the French Rococo of Fragonard (Rowlandson had studied in France), but his rollicking humour and delicate tonal effects were distinctively English; the marvel of his art is that there is no inconsistency between the bawdiness or boisterousness of the subject-matter and the beauty of his watercolour technique. He created an instantly recognizable gallery of social types, such as the old maid, the hackwriter and the crabbed antiquarian, and his buxom wenches have their descendants in the fat ladies of today's saucy seaside postcards. His repertory of themes was inexhaustible and his oevre has been termed the English equivalent of Balzac's Comédie humaine."

Dutch painter, who spent most of his life in Germany. He was studying in 1661 under Arend van Ravesteyn in The Hague; he was the pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter who specialised in finely detailed paintings of birds of rare plumage. In 1669 he was appointed Court Painter by the Great Elector in Potsdam, and in 1689, when Frederick III renewed his appointment, he moved to Berlin where he became a founder member and later Director of the new Berlin Academy. He died in Berlin in 1723."
4316,"ROYER, Lodewijk","(b. 1793, Mechelen, d. 1868, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/royer/biograph.html,"
Lodewijk [Louis] Royer, Flemish sculptor, active in the Netherlands. He first studied at the Mechelen Academy and from 1810 in the studio of Jan Frans van Geel. After studying in Paris for a year, he went to live in Amsterdam in 1820. At the time what is now present-day Belgium and the Netherlands were united in one kingdom under the rule of the Dutch. In 1823 he was the first sculptor to win the Dutch version of the Prix de Rome, a prize that was re-instituted by King William I in 1817. The Prix allowed Royer to study in Rome where he came under classicist influences. In Rome he portrayed from life Pope Leo XII."
4317,"RUBENS, Pieter Pauwel","(b. 1577, Siegen, d. 1640, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rubens/biograph.html,"Flemish painter who was the greatest exponent of Baroque painting's dynamism, vitality, and sensuous exuberance. His work is a fusion of the traditions of Flemish realism with the classical tendencies of the Italian Renaissance. Though his masterpieces include portraits and landscapes, Rubens is perhaps best known for his religious and mythological compositions.

"
4318,"RUBLYOV, Andrey","(b. ca. 1360, ?, d. 1430, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rublyov/biograph.html,"
Andrey Rublyov (Andrei Rublev) Russian painter and monk. All his known works and those attributed to him were undertaken in Moscow and in towns and monasteries near by; he may therefore be described as a representative of the Moscow school of painting, but his work had a profound influence on the development of Russian art in general."
4319,"RUCKERS, Hans the Elder","(b. ca. 1545, Mechelen, d. 1598, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ruckers/biograph.html,"
Flemish harpsichord and virginal maker, member of the Ruckers family (also spelt: Ruckaert, Ruckaerts, Rucqueer, Rueckers, Ruekaerts, Ruijkers, Rukkers, Rycardt). The family probably originated in Germany. It based in Antwerp in the 16th and 17th century and its influence stretched well into the 18th and to the harpsichord revival of the 20th."
4320,"RUDE, François","(b. 1784, Dijon, d. 1855, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rude/biograph.html,"
French Romantic sculptor. He was a fervent admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte and his emotionally charged work expresses the martial spirit of the Napoleonic era more fully than that of any other sculptor. In 1812 he won the Prix de Rome, but he was unable to take it up because of the Napoleonic Wars, and when Napoleon abdicated in 1814 he went into exile in Brussels with David."
4321,"RUES, Tommaso","(d. 1696, Venice)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rues/biograph.html,"
Austrian sculptor, a native of Bressanone, Tyrol, active in Italy. He is also referred to as Ruer, Ruez, or Rerer. He moved to Venice around 1650, where he worked as an apprentice for eight years in the studio of Giovanni Hach, a sculptor and stonecarver from Bamberg, who was in Venice after around 1627. Rues owes the Northern strand of his training, apparent in works from the 1670s to the long period spent working with this German master. It is the Northern element of his idiom that surfaces in the reliefs sculpted for the churches of Redentore (1682) and of San Cassiano (1684)."

Spanish sculptor. He was born in Utrera but moved to Seville at a young age. When he was 15 he enrolled in the Sevillian academy La Lonja and continued to study there even after becoming an apprentice to the sculptor Andrés Cansino (1636-1670). Around this time he was also influenced by Pedro Roldán, whose Baroque style he assimilated. By 1671 he was a master sculptor and by 1673 he had set up his own workshop. He was only 21 when he made Saint John of the Cross (c. 1675, National Gallery of Art, Washington) for the Convent of Nuestra Senora de los Remedios in Seville."
4324,"RUNGE, Philipp Otto","(b. 1777, Wolgast, d. 1810, Hamburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/runge/biograph.html,"
German painter and draughtsman. Although he made a late start to his career and died young, he ranks second only to Friedrich among German Romantic artists. He studied under Jens Juel at the Copenhagen Academy (1799-1801), then moved to Dresden, where he knew Friedrich. In 1803 he settled in Hamburg. Runge was of a mystical, pantheistic turn of mind and in his work he tried to express notions of the harmony of the universe through symbolism of colour, form, and numbers. To this end he planned a series of four paintings called The Times of the Day, designed to be seen in a special building and viewed to the accompaniment of music and poetry. He painted two versions of Morning (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), but the others did not advance beyond drawings. Runge was also one of the best German portraitists of his period; several examples are in Hamburg. His style was rigid, sharp, and intense, at times almost naive. In 1810 he published Die Farbenkugel (The Colour Sphere) after doing several years of research on colour, during which he corresponded with Goethe.

4325,"RUNK, Ferdinand","(b. 1764, Freiburg im Breisgau, d. 1834, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/runk/biograph.html,"
German painter and etcher. In 1785 Runk came to Vienna and studied there at the Academy of Visual Art. Johann Christian Brand and Martin Molitor, significant landscape painters, performed their work at the Vienna Academy in that time. Their relationship with the real nature, their sensitive access to the light and changes of weather influenced very soon the masterpieces of the young Runk. Just after the graduation at the Academy, Runk turned into a popular artist, particularly for the enjoyable variety of colours applied in his gouache landscape paintings. However he created oil-paintings as well. The gouache technique became the most proper manner of the Runk's artistic expression."

He painted still-life, especially fruit, in a manner reminiscent of the great Spanish still-life painters of the 17th century. His nephew and pupil Giuseppe (c. 1631-1710) painted in the same manner. The monogram G B R, common to Giovanni Battista and to the Recco family of still-life painters has caused confusion.

He was the outstanding sculptor in Rome during his period, a figure comparable to his friend Maratta in painting. The vigour and boldness of his style derive from Bernini, but Rusconi was more restrained and classical. His most important works are four over life-size statues of Apostles in S. Giovanni in Laterano (1708-18) and the tomb of Pope Gregory XIII (1719-25) in St Peter's.

He was an assistant of Andrea Palladio and help him on many projects. As proto (overseer) to the Provveditori al Sal, Rusconi was responsible in 1563 for the design of the new prisons in Venice (across the canal east of the Doge's Palace). The rear section of the prisons was begun in 1566 and completed to Rusconi's design, although it was enlarged in 1589 and re-faced with a new block by Antonio da Ponte, facing the Riva degli Schiavoni.

4330,"RUSH, William","(b. 1756, Philadelphia, d. 1833, Philadelphia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rush/biograph.html,"
American sculptor, active in his native Philadelphia. His father was a ship's carpenter and Rush worked mainly in wood, progressing from ships' figureheads to free-standing figures, such as the Nymph of the Schuylkill (1812), a work which almost perished through exposure to the elements in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and was preserved only when it was belatedly cast in bronze. His work is vigorous and naturalistic and he marks the transition from the unselfconscious folk carver to the professional artist. He was one of the prime movers in the foundation of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which has many examples of his work. Thomas Eakins, another native of Philadelphia, greatly admired Rush's work.

After a travel to Paris (1889) where he lived in Montmartre with Ramón Casas and with Ignacio Zuloaga, his picture adapted grey tonalities following the Whistler manner and influenced by Impressionists. His production of that period are basically landscapes, urban themes, portraits and also Art Nouveau symbolic compositions. From 1896 and after a travel to Andalusia, he started to paint gardens."

English pastel artist, amateur astronomer, and literary scholar, whose brilliantly coloured chalk portraits were highly appreciated in 18th-century England. His works were considered on a par with those of Sir Joshua Reynolds. An evangelical Methodist, he often voiced his religious views while drawing those who posed for him. He was retained as painter to George III. He also wrote several aesthetic and technical treatises on literature and painting. For 50 years he kept a diary on his religious exercises, and he laboured for 20 years with telescope and engraving tools on a lunar map.

Franco de' Russi (also Rossi, or Francesco di Giovanni de Russi), Italian illuminator born in Mantua. He was possibly a pupil of Guglielmo Giraldi in Ferrara. He is first recorded in a contract for the immense and extensively decorated Bible of Borso d'Este, which was completed between 1455 and 1461. In the early 1460s he may have left Ferrara and gone to Veneto, where there is mention of him in 1471 or 1472. At that time he was influenced by Andrea Mantegna."
4335,"RUSTICI, Giovanni Francesco","(b. ca. 1465, Roma, d. 1512, Loreto)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/rustici/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and painter. He was of noble birth, and his artistic activities were those of a dilettante. No formal apprenticeship is recorded: although Vasari called him a pupil of Verrocchio this can only have been indirectly, for Verrocchio died in Venice in 1488, when Rustici was 14. His later collaboration with Leonardo da Vinci does suggest a mutual familiarity with Verrocchio's workshop, which continued to operate after the master's death. Certainly, the well-informed Pomponius Gauricus, in De sculptura (Padua, 1504), named him as one of the principal sculptors of Tuscany, with Benedetto da Maiano, Andrea Sansovino and Michelangelo. Rustici also studied the Medici sculpture collection in the garden at S Marco in Florence, where, as an aristocrat, he would have been particularly welcome."

Italian painter and mosaicist. His only certain work is the mosaic on the façade of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, which is signed on the mandorla of Christ. It is not easy to determine the extent of his collaboration on these mosaics, since they have not only been reworked to a great extent but are also inconsistent in style."
4338,"RUTHART, Carl Borromäus Andreas","(b. 1630, Danzig, d. 1703, L'Aquila)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ruthart/biograph.html,"
German painter, specialist in painting animals. He was born and trained in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), and visited Rome in 1659. Ruthart spent 1663 and 1664 in Antwerp, where he joined the painters' guild and could study first-hand the work of Flemish animal painters such as Frans Snyders. Artists such as Wilhelm van Ehrenberg often called on Ruthart to add animals to their architectural or landscape scenes. His reputation lay not only in his understanding of animal anatomy and his skill at painting fur but his ability to integrate animals smoothly into a variety of settings, from mythological or biblical contexts to idyllic scenes. His work is characterized by restrained, cool colours with alternating light and shadow in the foreground."
4339,"RUXTHIEL, Henri-Joseph","(b. 1775, Lierneux, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ruxthiel/biograph.html,"

Dutch still-life painter, with van Huysum the most celebrated exponent of flower pieces of her period. The daughter of a botanist and the pupil of Willem van Aelst, she worked mainly in her native Amsterdam, but also in The Hague (1701-08) and Düsseldorf, where from 1708 to 1716 she was court painter to the Elector Palatine. Her richly devised bouquets were painted in delicate colours with meticulous detail, and their artistry and craftsmanship are worthy of the finest tradition of Dutch flower painting. She continued to use the dark backgrounds characteristic of van Aelst and the older generation long after van Huysum and other contemporaries had gone over to light backgrounds."
4341,"RUISDAEL, Isaack van","(b. 1599, Naarden, d. 1677, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ruysdael/isaack/biograph.html,"

4343,"RUYSDAEL, Salomon van","(b. ca. 1602, Naarden, d. 1670, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ruysdael/salomon/biograph.html,"
Dutch landscape painter of the Baroque style, uncle of the landscape artist Jacob van Ruisdael.

Originally named de Goyer, as was his brother Isaack (also a painter and the father of Jacob van Ruisdael), Salomon entered the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1628. His first dated pictures are from 1627. He spent his whole life in Haarlem, where he was head of the guild in 1648.

Van Ruysdael's early works - winter scenes - continue the tradition of Esaias van de Velde, and his early landscapes are based on the colour schemes and compositions of Pieter Molyn; it has been suggested that he may have studied with either or both painters. At least by 1628 he is mentioned as a landscape painter of Haarlem. Unlike certain other landscape painters of the period, his nephew among them, van Ruysdael generally painted actual landscapes of such places as Arnhem, Dordrecht, and Utrecht, sometimes combining motifs from different places in one picture. His early river landscapes of the 1630s, which are characterized by diagonal compositions of the dunes, are similar in composition and use of colour to the celebrated river scenes of his contemporary Jan van Goyen. Experts agree that van Ruysdael's most powerful work was done after 1645. His command of the landscape elements - great trees anchoring one side of the composition, distant views that draw the eye, and a vast expanse of sky and clouds - seems more assured, and his use of colour for effect more brilliant. From that point van Ruysdael became increasingly interested in light effects and decorative elements in his compositions. Critics have speculated that his change of style was in part owing to the influence of several Dutch painters (such as Jan Both) who were returning to Holland from study in Italy.

Flemish painter, part of a family of painters, son of David Ryckaert I (the Elder), elder brother of the landscape painter Maerten Ryckaert. David trained with his father and became a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1607-08. He spent his entire career in Antwerp. He married Catharina de Merre in 1608; the couple had at least two children: Catharina (b. 1610) and David III. He was also active as an art dealer."
4346,"RYCKAERT, David the Younger","(b. 1612, Antwerpen, d. 1661, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ryckaert/david3/biograph.html,"
David Ryckaert the Younger (David Rijckaert III), Flemish painter. He was taught by his father David Ryckaert II (1586–1642). In 1636 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke, and in 1652 he was appointed Dean of the Guild. His brother-in-law, Gonzales Coques, was his pupil. Among his patrons was Archduke Leopold William, governor of the Spanish Netherlands.

4347,"RYCKAERT, Maerten","(b. 1587, Antwerpen, d. 1633, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/r/ryckaert/maerten/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, descendant of a dynasty of Antwerp painters: he was the son of David Ryckaert the Elder and uncle of the prolific genre painter David Ryckaert the Younger. He received his initial training from his father and later from the landscape painter Tobias Verhaeght, who was also responsible for the training of the landscape painter Joos de Momper. Although it has often been asserted that Ryckaert travelled to Italy around 1605-10, no such trip is documented. The assumption that he journeyed south would appear to come from his emulation of the works of Paul Bril, who himself had worked in Italy throughout his long and prolific life. Ryckaert made numerous paintings after Bril's designs from after circa 1615. These works by Bril were imported from Rome to Antwerp where they were much in demand and there was apparently also a strong market for Ryckaert's variations after Bril.

Bernaert de Ryckere (Rijckere or Ricke), Flemish painter. The artist was born in Courtrai but became a member of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1561. Only five signed works by him are known, all in a style very much dependent upon the example of Frans Floris. A number of paintings signed with the monogram B have also been assigned to his hand.

Flemish painter, active in England. In 1710-11 he was made a master in Antwerp, but c. 1720 he and his brother Michael Rysbrack settled in England, where they were joined by another brother, the still-life painter Gerard Rysbrack. In England, Pieter Andreas Rysbrack specialized in Flemish-style still-lifes and game pieces, he also painted a number of topographical landscapes and country-house portraits. His two sets of Chiswick House Gardens (c. 1729; Chatsworth, Derbys, and elsewhere), commissioned by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, were an influential contribution to the vogue during the second quarter of the 18th century for sets of garden views. An engraved View of Mr Pope's House at Twickenham by Nathaniel Parr - the only print of Alexander Pope's Thames-side villa to be issued in the poet's lifetime - was made in 1735 after a drawing (untraced) by Rysbrack; five years later Rysbrack painted a view of Richmond Ferry (London, Orleans House Gallery) from a spot a mile downstream. He remained in England for the rest of his life.

Belgian painter, designer and sculptor, brother of the architect Octave Van Rysselberghe (1855-1929). He was enrolled in the Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in Ghent at an early age. In 1879 he became a pupil of Jean-François Portaels, director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, whose Orientalist works he admired. Van Rysselberghe first exhibited at the Salon in Brussels in 1881. The next year he won a travelling scholarship and, following in the footsteps of Portaels, visited Spain and Morocco. With fellow artists Darío de Regoyos and Constantin Meunier, Van Rysselberghe recorded picturesque scenes of everyday life. He exhibited these Mediterranean pictures in 1883 at L'Essor. He attended the historic meeting on 28 October 1883 at which the avant-garde exhibition society Les XX was created, and at their exhibition in 1885 he showed the results of a second Moroccan trip, including the exotic Fantasia (Brussels, Musée Royal d'Art Moderne)."
4352,"SABATELLI, Luigi","(b. 1772, Firenze, d. 1850, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sabatell/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, printmaker and draughtsman. After training in Florence in the Neo-classical tradition, he won a scholarship and settled in Rome between 1789 and 1794. His patron Tommaso Puccini was an intellectual and connoisseur who later became Director of the Gallerie Fiorentine. He was first attracted to the constructive rigour of François-Guillaume Ménageot, who taught at the Académie de France, but later he became interested in a more contemporary classicism in the style of David, and in particular in the rather austere variant represented by such pupils of David's in Rome as François-Xavier Fabre. Sabatelli borrowed explicitly from Classical works, as can be seen in his reconstruction of the furnishings, clothing and hairstyles of the Roman period, and in his use of a type of drawing practised by the followers of David. His borrowings were more from the style of Classical art than from its philology, yet his paintings were nonetheless clearly liberated from tradition. There was an emphasis on severity and intensity, sparse, angular, compositions and pronounced contrasts."
4353,"SABATINI, Francesco","(b. 1721, Palermo, d. 1797, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sabatin/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Spain. He studied architecture in Rome. His first contacts with the Spanish monarchy was when he participated in the construction of the Palace of Caserta for the King of Naples and Duke of Parma and Tuscany, Charles VII, the future King Charles III of Spain. When he was raised to the Spanish throne, he called Sabatini to Madrid in 1760, where he was positioned above the most outstanding Spanish architects of the time. He was appointed as Great Master of Royal Works, with the rank of lieutenant colonel at the Engineers Corps, simultaneously designated also as an honorary academician of the Academia Real de Bellas Artes de San Fernando."
4354,"SABATINI, Lorenzo","(b. ca. 1520, Bologna, d. 1576, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sabatini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His early education is linked to the Maniera of Pellegrino Tibaldi, Niccolò dell'Abate and Prospero Fontana, who was probably his teacher and collaborator. His chief characteristics as a painter are a Tusco-Roman plasticity derived from Vasari and a lively Emilian mannerism absorbed through the study of Parmigianino. The most important work from his controversial early career is the Last Supper (San Girolamo alla Certosa, Bologna), which must have functioned almost as a pendant to another painting, the (untraced) Marriage at Cana, known through a print by Cornelis Cort. Both appear to date from the 1560s. The fresco depicting Artemisia (Palazzo Poggi, Bologna), the Holy Family with Saints (San Egidio, Bologna) and the canvas of Judith with the Head of Holofernes (c. 1562; Banca del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna, Bologna) have also been assigned to this early period."

Swiss painter, the younger brother of Jean François Sablet. Son of a decorator and gilder from Lausanne, he studied with his father before moving to Paris in 1772; there he worked with Joseph-Marie Vien for three years. When in 1775 Vien was named director of the French Academy in Rome, Sablet accompanied him there. His ambition was to be a history painter, but facing competition from Jacques-Louis David and Pierre Peyron, among others, and lacking solid academic training, he could win no commissions. Instead he turned to portraiture, genre painting, and landscape painting. Most of his genre scenes depicted the city's everyday life and customs of the Campagna."

They both studied at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris as pupils of Joseph-Marie Vien, Jean-François in 1768-73 and Jacques-Henri in 1772-75. Although their careers did not follow a similar course, the attribution of their works has frequently been confused."
4357,"SACCHETTI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1690, Torino, d. 1764, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sacchett/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Spain. Taught by Filippo Juvarra, he assisted his master by building models, preparing drawings, and compiling an important list of his works. He designed several temporary funerary structures for the House of Savoy, and oversaw (from 1734), the building of San Filippo, Turin, designed by Juvarra."

He was a pupil of Albani, but he was inspired chiefly by Raphael, and with the sculptors Algardi and Duquesnoy he became the chief exponent of the style sometimes called 'High Baroque Classicism'. In defence of the classical princples of order and moderation, Sacchi engaged in a controversy in the Academy of St Luke with Pietro da Cortona on the question of whether history paintings should have few figures (as Sacchi maintained) or many (Cortona). Sacchi's ideas were more immediately influential, but his ponderous ceiling fresco of Divine Wisdom (1629-33) in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome is completely outshone by Cortona's exhilarating ceiling of the Grand Salone in the same building.

Netherlandish engraver, draughtsman and mapmaker, part of a family of artists. Orphaned in childhood, he was raised by an uncle, Pieter de Jongh, a bailiff in Assendelft. Though brought up for a life of farm labour and handiwork, he turned to drawing and in time attained some success as a mapmaker. With the help of a local lawyer, he entered the circle of Hendrick Goltzius relatively late in life, in 1589, and worked for short periods with both Goltzius and Jacques de Gheyn II. According to both de Bie and Schrevelius, there was some rivalry between each of these masters and Saenredam, who quickly absorbed what they had to offer him. About 1595 Saenredam returned to Assendelft, where he married and where his son Pieter was born.

Dutch painter of architectural subjects, particularly church interiors, active in Haarlem. Saenredam, the son of an engraver, was a hunchback and a recluse, but he was acquainted with the great architect Jacob van Campen, who may have played a part in determining his choice of subject. He was the first painter to concentrate on accurate depictions of real buildings rather than the fanciful inventions of the Mannerist tradition. His pictures were based on painstaking drawings and are scrupulously accurate and highly finished, but they never seem pedantic or niggling and are remarkable for their delicacy of colour and airy grace. The Cathedral of St Bavo (where he is buried) in Haarlem was favourite subject, but he also travelled to other Dutch towns to make drawings, and Utrecht is represented in several of his paintings. He also made a few views of Rome based on drawings in a sketchbook by Marten van Heemskerck that he owned. His work had great influence on Dutch painting.

He studied with Antonio Giusti and Romolo Panfi (1632-1690) and then visited Rome, Venice and Bologna, where he joined Carlo Cignani's workshop. On returning to Florence in the 1690s he enrolled (1694) in the Accademia del Disegno and became interested in the anti-academic style of Pietro Dandini and Alessandro Gherardini (1655-1723). His earliest known works are from 1702: the frescoes and the altarpiece in the chapel of Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi in San Frediano in Cestello, Florence. In 1707 he produced eight canvases depicting scenes from the Life of the Virgin for Santa Margherita in Santa Maria de' Ricci, and between 1708 and 1714 he made two paintings for Santa Maria delle Selve in Lastra a Signa.

He broke with the Académie Royale, preferring to support and exhibit at the Académie de St Luc. Although he continued to paint such pictures as A Street Show in Paris (c. 1760; London, National Gallery; other examples in Rouen, Musée des Beaux-Arts), he is best known as a draughtsman and etcher. He was a passionate and unconventional observer of the sights of the Paris streets and of the social scene. In his many drawings he combined pencil, black and red chalk, bistre, ink and watercolour to create dazzling spontaneous effects. He drew incidents that struck him as he wandered the streets, or entertainments that he attended. He recorded them, noting dates and times, in sketchbooks or sometimes in the margins and blank pages of printed books that he was carrying. These drawings of contemporary incidents include the Fire at the Foire Saint-Germain on the Night of 16-17 May 1762 (private collection) and the Crowning of Voltaire at the Théâtre-Français in 1778 (Paris, Louvre)."

Flemish painter, also called Jean de Namur. He was perhaps a pupil of Lambert Lombard. Documented as a painter for the city of Namur (in Dutch: Namen) by 1562, he worked in Namur until after 1578. In 1590 he was court painter and keeper of the vineyards to Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma in Brussels. He worked in Mechelen between 1603 and 1624.

Flemish painter, part of a family of painters, son of Jan Baptist I and sibling of the painter Frans Saive (documented 1599). Although little is known about his early career, it is most likely that he studied in the workshop of his father. His own paintings retain a strong stylistic affinity with those of his father, whose work show a clear influence of Lucas van Valckenborch. The oeuvre of Jan Baptist II remains less defined, and the works given to him appear to have more stylistic affinities with the work of Joachim Beuckelaer. It seems likely that father and son Saive ran a fairly large workshop that produced a number of large scale kitchens and markets in response to popular demand, and that the separation of their distinct artistic personalities remains problematic.

Ventura possibly spent some time in northern Italy before going to Rome, where he worked from 1588, collaborating on the fresco decoration of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (the Vatican Library) during the reign of Pope Sixtus V (reg 1585-90). Salimbeni's painting during 1590-91, when he worked in Il Gesu and S Maria Maggiore, Rome, reflects the influence of the Cavaliere d'Arpino, Cherubino Alberti and Andrea Lilli.

Much bad feeling existed: in his testimony Caravaggio contemptuously described Salini as Baglione's ""guardian angel"", dismissing his daubs and denying having ever seen any of his works. In his life of Salini, Baglione not only described several of the painter's public commissions, but also credited him as the first to paint and arrange flowers with leaves in vases. Those pictures that have been identified include his altarpiece dedicated to San Nicola da Tolentino in Sant'Agostino, Rome, the main altarpiece from Sant'Agnese in Agone in Piazza Navona showing St Agnes saved by an angel, and the standard for the Compagnia degli Scalpellini at Santi Quattro Coronati, Rome.

He also made paintings for churches in the villages around Brussels, notably the cycle of 12 paintings depicting the History of the Church at Alsemberg for Onze-Lieve-Vrouwkerk at Alsemberg (1647-49; in situ).

Reportedly an eccentric, he became a successful painter of marine views, adopting a range of different scales, including small wooden panels, larger canvases and theatre backdrops. Moonlight Coastal Scene (1836; St Louis, Art Museum) is typical of his works on panel, and it demonstrates his use of light to silhouette form. There are no extant examples of the panoramic views done as backdrops; his canvases such as Wharves of Boston (1829; Boston, Old State House) and View of Charlestown (1833; Annapolis, US Naval Academy Museum) are full of carefully delineated figures, minute and accurate details of the ships and their rigging, and, most importantly, large expanses of sky dominated by strong light."
4385,"SALÒ, Pietro di Lorenzo da",(active 1535-c. 1562 in Venice),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/salo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. He worked in Venice and Padua. His style principally shows the influence of his teacher, Jacopo Sansovino, but also derives from that of Alessandro Vittoria and Danese Cattaneo. Two records of payment exist, from 4 July 1535 and 5 July 1549, for some unspecified works carried out at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, Venice, and in 1536 he executed and signed the statue of Mars for Doge Andrea Gritti's balcony at the Doge's Palace. Further works there include two chimneys executed in 1553-54 in collaboration with Danese Cattaneo."

Spanish sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, uncle of Manuel Salvador Carmona. He was sent to be trained in Madrid in the workshop of Juan Alonso Villabrille y Ron (1663-after 1728), under whom he worked from about 1723. On Villabrille y Ron's death after 1728, Salvador Carmona continued working under the former's son-in-law José Galbán (1705-1766) until about 1732 when he set up his own highly efficient workshop in Madrid, which he ran for over 30 years.

Originally Francesco de' Rossi, he adopted his name from his patron Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, with whom he went to Rome c. 1530 and for whom he painted the work that established his reputation there - the frescoes in the Oratorio di San Giovanni Decollato, Rome  (1538). In 1539 he travelled to Venice, and from the 1540s led a restless life, working mainly in Florence and Rome, but also visiting Fontainebleau in 1556-57.

Italian painter (originally Giuseppe Porta). He was apprenticed to Francesco Salviati (whose surname he took) in Rome from 1535 and apparently assisted him in the decoration of a number of façades there. The gravitas and sculptural quality of the Roman figural style are reflected in Giuseppe's later work. In 1539, with Francesco, he left Rome, stopping in Florence and Bologna, where he met Giorgio Vasari, and arriving in Venice by 11 July. Giuseppe's earliest known independent works are illustrations for Le sorti, a book on fortune-telling published by Francesco Marcolini (Venice, 1540).

His earliest known work is the bust of Antoine Pater (terracotta; Valenciennes, Musée des Beaux-Arts) modelled with slightly exaggerated realism in 1738, the same year that he won the Prix de Rome. From 1740 until 1748 he studied at the Académie de France in Rome, where, among other works, he executed a marble copy (untraced) of the antique statue of Antinous and drew a series of 30 ornamental vases, which he engraved in Rome and which, bound in a single volume, were presented to Jean-Baptiste Troy, the Director of the Académie. They were later republished in Paris, where they were influential in the formation of Neo-classical taste."

Italian painter (also Sammacchini or Sammachini). Although a pupil of Pellegrino Tibaldi, his early work mainly reflects the classicism of Raphael as interpreted by Bagnacavallo and the Mannerism of Innocenzo da Imola and Prospero Fontana. Simplicity of form, limpid colours and purity of line characterize such early works as the Marriage of the Virgin (c. 1555-60; Bologna, S Giuseppe). Also datable to this early period is the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (Bologna, private collection), which unites the style and typological elements of Fontana with a highly refined use of colour reminiscent of early 16th-century south Netherlandish painting."
4398,"SAMBACH, Caspar Franz","(b. 1715, Breslau, d. 1795, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sambach/biograph.html,"

He trained as a historical painter at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, becoming a member in 1759, a professor in 1762 and director in 1773. His fresco and altarpiece paintings were influenced by other Central European painters, the likes of Paul Troger, Michelangelo Unterberger and the younger Franz Anton Maulbertsch."
4399,"SAMBIN, Hugues","(b. ca. 1520, Gray, d. 1601, Dijon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sambin/biograph.html,"

He engraved a magnificent series of plates relating to the art of sculpture which were published in 1572 and dedicated to Eleonor Chabot, the governor of Burgundy. Sambin made his reputation directing his father-in-law's joinery shop throughout his life."
4400,"SAMMARTINO, Giuseppe","(b. 1720, Napoli, d. 1793, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sammarti/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, one of the foremost stuccoist of his period in Naples. He was probably trained in the workshop of the sculptor Matteo Bottigliero (active 1724-54). His first signed and dated work is the marble statue of the Dead Christ (1753) in the Sansevero Chapel in Naples. This work had originally been commissioned from the Venetian sculptor Antonio Corradini, who, on his death in 1752, left only a terracotta model. Sanmartino interpreted the model very freely and produced a work of skilful realism, which demonstrates that Sanmartino had already reached artistic maturity, and it earnt him immediate popularity in Naples, especially at the Bourbon court."

4403,"SANCHEZ COTÁN, Juan","(b. 1561, Orgaz, d. 1627, Granada)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sanchez/cotan/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was a still-life painter in Toledo until 1603, when he decided to become a monk, and in the following year he entered the Carthusian monastery at Granada as a laybrother. The religious works he painted after this date are unexceptional, but as a still-life painter he ranks with the great names of European painting. Characteristically he depicts a few simple fruits or vegetables, arranged on a ledge or shelf with an almost geometric clarity and standing out against a dark background (Quince, Cabbage, Melon, Cucumber, San Diego Museum of Art, 1602). Each form is scrutinized with such intensity that the pictures take on a mystical quality, conveying a feeling of wonder and humility in front of the humblest items in God's creation. Sánchez Cotán's austere style had considerable influence on Spanish painting, notably on Zurbarán.

4405,"SANCTIS, Francesco de","(b. 1679, Roma, d. 1731, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sanctis/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He is most notable for his design of the Spanish Steps in Rome in collaboration with Alessandro Specchi. These were built between 1723 and 1726 to celebrate the peace treaty between France and Spain, linking the top of the hill (under French influence, with the church of Trinità dei Monti and French monastic institutions) to the Spanish embassy to the Holy See at the bottom of the hill. The design left out some of the richer elements of De Sanctis's original design, such as grand fountains at a break in the steps and two rows of trees down either side to give shade and refreshment to those climbing the steps."

4410,"SAN FRIANO, Maso da","(b. 1531, Firenze, d. 1571, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sanfrian/biograph.html,"
Maso da San Friano (Tommaso d'Antonio Manzuoli) was an Italian painter. He received his initial training from either Pier Francesco Foschi or Carlo Portelli. The style of his earliest known work, the signed and dated Portrait of Two Architects (1556; Rome, Palazzo Venezia), suggests Foschi. By 1560 Maso's reputation was such that he received two important commissions for altarpieces. For the de' Pesci Chapel in San Pier Maggiore, Florence, he painted a Visitation (1560; Cambridge, Trinity Hall), revealing his intense fascination with the art of Andrea del Sarto. In its High Renaissance compositional structure and grandeur of movement, the work pays homage to del Sarto's large altarpieces, such as the Passerini Assumption of the Virgin (1526; Florence, Pitti). Maso's Virgin and Child with Saints (Cortona, Convento della Trinità) is primarily a simplification and abstraction of works by del Sarto, whose influence is particularly evident in the male saints, but it also contains elements from the works of Foschi (the faces of the women) and Jacopo Pontormo, particularly the cursive, pliant figure of Mary Magdalene.

In visiting Cyprus and Crete for the Serenissima Sanmicheli is probably the only practicing Venetian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to see Greek architecture, a possible source for his use of Roman Doric columns without bases."

4433,SARACCHI brothers,(active 2nd half of the 16th century in Milan),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/saracchi/biograph.html,"
Italian family of hardstone engravers, active in Milan from the mid-16th century to the early 17th. Bartolomeo Saracco, a hardstone engraver, is mentioned in documents between 1561 and 1578, and had five sons who worked as glyptic artists: Giovanni Ambrogio Saracco (b. 1540-41), Simone Saracco (b. 1547-8), Stefano Saracco (b. 1550-51; d. before 1595), Michele Saracco (b. after 1550) and Raffaello Saracco (b. after 1550; d. before 1595). In early 1573 Giovanni Ambrogio, Simone and Stefano offered to go to Munich to work for Albert V, Duke of Bavaria. Giovanni Ambrogio and Stefano specialized in producing vessels of sculptural form for which they actually ground the material. Simone's art, which was rated more highly, consisted in carving the intaglio decoration. The move to Munich did not come about, however, and the family workshop remained in Milan.



"
4434,"SARACENI, Carlo","(b. 1579, Venezia, d. 1620, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/saraceni/biograph.html,"
Saraceni spent almost all his career in Rome, where he formed his style under the influence of Caravaggio and Elsheimer, painting small luminous pictures of figures in landscapes as well as much larger altarpieces, including the replacement of Caravaggio's Death of the Virgin (Louvre, Paris), which the church of Sta Maria della Scala had rejected in 1606. Saraceni's picture is still ""in situ"". He painted several other smaller variants or versions of the picture, so the design was evidently popular. His style was sensitive and poetic, showing a delicate feeling for colour and tone. His liking for turbans, tasselled fringes, and stringy drapery folds, and his richly impasted paint may have influenced Dutch artists in Rome such as Lastman and Pynas, and through them Rembrandt.

He was in Rome 1610-c. 1627, during which time he formed his style on the example of antique and classicising artists such as Domenichino and Duquesnoy. On his return to Paris he established himself as head of his profession, running an important workshop through which passed many of the leading sculptors of the following generation (those who worked at Versailles).

4436,"SARAZIN DE BELMONT, Louise Joséphine","(b. 1790, Versailles, d. 1870, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sarazin1/biograph.html,"
French painter. She was a pupil of Valenciennes, the grandfather of French landscape painting. She excelled at landscape and architectural painting herself, and regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon in the years between 1812 and 1867, a substantial Salon career for a woman painter. In 1831 she was awarded a second class medal there, and in 1834 she garnered first prize. Her paintings may be seen in the collections the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, in museums in Dresden, Hanover and Montauban, and in several French museums including the Louvre, Paris.

Italian architect active in Rome. He was born at Sant'Angelo in Vado, Marche which was then part of the Papal States. Known primarily for his church of Santa Maria del Rosario in Marino outside Rome, his name has been linked with the design of the façade of the church of Santa Maria Maddalena in Rome although his involvement with this and with some other building projects remains uncertain. He is not to be confused with the Swiss Italian architect, Giuseppe Sardi (1624-1699), who was active in Venice.

American painter and draughtsman, active in England. The most fashionable portrait painter working in England and the USA in the late 19th century, he was brought up by expatriate American parents in an environment of restless travel and insulated family life. He was cosmopolitan in outlook, a linguist, a fine pianist and an avid reader of the classics. The spirit of self-sufficiency and isolation, both physical and emotional, remained with him all his life. He never married, grew wary of emotional entanglements and remained closest to his sisters, especially the eldest, Emily."

Sassetta (Stefano di Giovanni), perhaps the greatest of the early 15th century Sienese painters. He mingles an innate conservatism, especially in his architectural structures, with a delight in the svelte forms of International Gothic figure design, and in the clarity and unity of Renaissance pictorial space. The essentially 14th century basis of his style, the dreamlike blending of reality and unreality, of graceful calm and visionary fervour, are all epitomized in his dismembered masterpiece, the double-sided altarpiece of 1337-44 for S. Francesco, Borgo S. Sepolcro (part in the Louvre, Paris and National Gallery, London).


"
4446,SASSOFERRATO,"(b. 1609, Sassoferrato, d. 1685, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sassofer/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Battista Salvi, Italian painter known by the name of his town of birth - Sassoferrato - and active in nearby Urbino and other cities of central Italy, notably Rome (where he was a pupil of Domenichino) and Perugia. He did some portraits but specialized in religious works painted in an extremely sweet, almost Peruginesque style. They are very clearly drawn and pure in colouring and totally un-Baroque in feeling - indeed they have a deliberately archaic quality that brings the paintings of the Nazarenes (a group of young, idealistic German painters of the early 19th century) to mind."

Dutch painter, etcher and draughtsman, part of a family of artist, the older brother of Roelandt Savery. His teacher, according to van Mander, was the Flemish painter and draughtsman Hans Bol, who also became an Amsterdam citizen in 1591. The two may have come north from Antwerp together. Bol's influence, especially his miniaturist style, is evident in Jacob's earliest known works of 1584-86. These are typically cabinet-size landscapes, finely painted in gouache and combining mountains, waterways, woodlands and villages with hunts or nominal biblical or mythological subjects."
4451,"SAVERY, Jacob II","(b. 1592, Amsterdam, d. 1651, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/savery/jacob2/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists of Flemish origin.

Dutch painter and etcher of landscapes, animal subjects, and still-life, the best-known member of a family of artists. He was born in Courtrai, grew up in Amsterdam, and in 1619 settled in Utrecht, but he is best known for his association with Prague, where he worked for the emperor Rudolf II from 1603 to 1613. Rudolf's famous menagerie allowed him to study in detail the exotic animals that became the trademark of his work. He painted and drew creatures such as pelicans, ostriches, camels, and the now extinct dodo, and was one of the first artists in the Netherlands to do pictures of animals alone. His favourite subjects, however, were Orpheus and the Garden of Eden, which allowed him to include any number of colourful beasts."

Dutch printmaker, part of a family of artists, son of Jacob Savery I. He was active in Amsterdam, but in 1632 he visited England. His earliest dated print is from 1610. Landscapes and portraits were his main subjects. He made several prints after paintings by Rembrandt. He engraved title prints on several plays by Joost van den Vondel and produced 12 prints for the translation of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes published in 1657.

Italian sculptor. A wood sculptor (intaiador) by profession, Savin was a friend of Antonio Lombardo. When Lombardo abandoned his work on Cardinal Zen's chapel in San Marco, Venice, in 1506, he must have recommended Savin to the Procurators of San Marco as his successor. In July 1506 Savin and Giovanni Battista Bregno were commissioned to produce six Virtues to be cast in bronze for the sides of the tomb of Cardinal Zen, four of which were completed by 1507. Savin seems to have gradually replaced Antonio Lombardo, furnishing models for two statues of St Peter and St John the Baptist for the altar, a model for the relief of the Resurrection for the antependium (1508-12) and finally models for the sarcophagus and its effigy (completed in 1519).

One of his painting portrays Jan de Doot, a blacksmith, holding in one hand a kitchen knife, and in the other a large kidney stone the size and shape of an egg. This 17th century Dutch blacksmith is said to have performed a successful lithotomy on himself in 1651. This painting is in the Anatomy Museum of the University of Leiden.

Antonio di Pietro Abbondi, known as Scarpagnino, Italian architect. He was active in Venice from October 1505, when he was appointed as a mason by the Salt Office (in effect the Venetian Board of Works). His first assignment was to take over the rebuilding of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (which had been damaged by fire) from Giorgio Spavento; his work there does not seem, however, to have had a substantial influence on the appearance of the structure, which was inspired by Fra Giaconolo. In 1507 he was apparently involved in building San Sebastiano and Santo Spirito on the Giudecca. He restored the Rialto Bridge, already restored by Giorgio Spavento."

German sculptor, graphic artist, and writer on art. He travelled in Italy. 1785-87, and in 1788 he settled in Berlin, where he became head of the Academy in 1816. His style was Neoclassical (he knew Canova in Italy), but retained a degree of Baroque liveliness. He was active mainly as a portraitist and tomb sculptor, but his best-known work is the quadriga (four-horse chariot) (1793) surmounting the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which was badly damaged in the Second World War. His finest achievement is perhaps the charming and sensitive group of The Princesses Luise and Frederika of Prussia (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1795-97). From the 1820s his sight deteriorated and he turned more to graphic work (he was a draughtsman, engraver, and lithographer) and to writing on art theory."
4466,"SCHADOW, Ridolfo","(b. 1786, Roma, d. 1822, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schadow/ridolfo/biograph.html,"
Ridolfo [Rudolf] Schadow, German sculptor, son of Johann Gottfried Schadow. He trained in his father's studio in Berlin, exhibiting statues and reliefs at the Berlin Akademie exhibitions between 1802 and 1810. Work from this period included both mythological and religious subjects. In 1810, with his brother Wilhelm Schadow, Ridolfo moved to Rome, in 1811 taking over the Roman sculpture studio of Christian Daniel Rauch."

German painter, teacher and writer, son of Johann Gottfried Schadow. He studied at the Berlin Akademie from 1805 and in 1806 showed paintings at the annual Akademie exhibition. Under his teacher, Friedrich Georg Weitsch, he quickly became a skilled portrait painter, and by 1810 he was commissioned to paint portraits of members of the Prussian royal family and of the Empress of Austria. Influenced by the English artist John Flaxman, Schadow developed an emphasis on outline. In 1810 Schadow went with his brother Ridolfo Schadow to Rome, where in 1813 he became a member of the Lukasbrüder and, in 1814, a Catholic."
4468,"SCHAFFNER, Martin","(b. 1477/78, ?, d. 1549, Ulm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schaffne/biograph.html,"
German painter and medallist. He produced some of the outstanding altarpieces of the Renaissance in Swabia. His birthdate is suggested by a self-portrait medal of 1522 (Munich, Staatliche Münzsammlung) on which he describes himself as aged 44. He was obviously trained in Jörg Stocker's workshop in Ulm: his name first appears on the reverse side of the winged altar made by Stocker in 1496 for St Martin at Ennetach (Sigmaringen Castle), where he signed the Carrying of the Cross. Yet Schaffner's contribution here would have been confined to subsidiary details; Stocker, a rather conservative and spiritless artist, could have imparted only basic painting skills to the young painter. An altar wing with paintings on both sides (1500; Ulm, Museum), perhaps also painted by Schaffner in Stocker's studio, seems old-fashioned, though not totally devoid of the charm of his later figures. Schaffner was a taxpaying householder in Ulm in 1499, suggesting that he had meanwhile become an independent master, free to develop along his own lines."

He first studied in Dordrecht with Samuel van Hoogstraten and then with Dou in Leiden. He became the latter's close imitator and won his reputation with candlelight scenes, usually of coquettish young women, done in Dou's manner. In the 1660s he returned to Dordrecht which remained the centre of his activity until 1691, when he settled in The Hague, a city that offered more opportunities than Dordrecht. He travelled to London in 1692 where he spent six years. During his London sojourn he painted a half-length of William III in armour seen by candlelight. Here Schalcken used his virtuosity at painting candlelight to give added meaning to the portrait. There were visual and emblematic traditions for using a burning candle as a metaphor for a self-sacrificing individual who burns himself out by helping others.

He did not become a member of the Académie and so could not exhibit at the Salon until the French Revolution. He worked for private patrons, producing erotic and pastoral subjects in a style influenced by François Boucher, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Pierre-Antoine Baudouin; many of these pictures achieved popularity in the form of engravings. His most distinctive paintings are single figures of dancers and young ladies in soft, picturesque landscape settings "

Austrian sculptor. He had his early training from various masters (including Zauner) before he joined the Viennese porcelain factory as a modeller. From 1812 he was in Rome, where he modeled his work strongly on Canova. He also made friends with Thorvaldsen, who became a great patron. On receiving a commission from the court to work up a lifesize male statue of youthful age, he opted for a group based on Bellerophon Fighting the Chimaera."

From Rome he travelled to the Venetian territories and visited Bologna. In 1569 he entered the service of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II (reg 1564-76) in Vienna. There, he modeled several polychrome terracotta busts, including a self-portrait (now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), that display a remarkable naturalism."

German painter and designer of woodcuts. Nothing is known about the date and place of Hans Schäufelein's birth or his initial training, but he is considered to have been born c. 1480/1485. Although often called Hans Leonhard Schäufelein, there is apparently no documentation for the name Leonhard. Schäufelein probably entered Albrecht Dürer's Nuremberg workshop c. 1503/1504 and Dürer's influence is evident in Schäufelein's earliest graphic works, the woodcuts he produced for Der Beschlossen Gart der Rosenkranz, published by Ulrich Pinder in 1505, and in 1507 the illustrations to the Speculum Passionis Domini Nostri Ihesu Christi. At the time of Dürer's second trip to Italy, Schäufelein seems to have held a responsible position in the shop, for he painted, partly from Dürer's designs, the Ober-Sankt Veit altarpiece, commissioned by Elector Friedrich the Wise and his brother John, possibly for a church in Nuremberg."

He then chose jurisprudence as his professional study, but at the same time zealously pursued humanistic learning under Pieter Luder, whom he followed to Padua in 1463. He there took up the study of medicine in which he obtained a doctorate in 1466. In 1472 he became a physician at Nordlingen; in 1477, at Amberg; in 1481, at Nuremberg where he lived until his death."

Among them we can see both a direct line to Correggio, the finely detailed way of working used by the Carracci cousins, and all of the latest trends from Rome.

4480,"SCHEFFAUER, Philipp Jakob","(b. 1756, Stuttgart, d. 1808, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scheffau/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. At high school in Stuttgart, he was a fellow student of Heinrich Dannecker. After completing his training, together with Dannecker, he was sent for further studies as court sculptor to Paris, where he was trained under Augustin Pajou. Then he spent four years in Italy. In his mature style, the refined elegance that he had absorbed from Pajou merged with a precision of form acquired from intense observation of ancient art."
4481,"SCHEFFER, Ary","(b. 1795, Dordrecht, d. 1858, Argenteuil)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scheffer/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, engraver, and book illustrator, active for almost all his career in Paris. His work was immensely popular in his lifetime, but is now generally considered sentimental. Early in his career he favoured literary themes (Francesca da Rimini, Wallace Collection, London 1835, and other versions), but later he turned to mawkishly treated religious subjects (SS. Augustine and Monica, National Gallery, London, 1854, and other versions). He also painted many portraits. His work is well represented in the museum at Dordrecht, his native town.



"
4482,SCHEGGIA,"(b. 1406, San Giovanni Valdarno, d. 1486, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scheggia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, original name Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi. The son of a notary and younger brother of Masaccio, he spent some time as a mercenary soldier. From December 1420 and through the following year Giovanni is recorded in Florence in the workshop of Bicci di Lorenzo. In 1426 he is mentioned in the estimo and in 1427 in the catasto (land registry declaration) written by his brother. Documents suggest that he was in close collaboration with Masaccio's workshop. In 1429 Giovanni paid a three soldi tax based on his own professional activity. In 1430 he enrolled in the Compagnia di S Luca, where he appears as Scheggia ('Splinter'), a nickname given in Tuscany to individuals of slight stature or who are somehow connected with wood. On 23 October 1433 Giovanni matriculated in the Arte dei Medici e Speziali."
4483,"SCHENCK, Pieter","(b. 1660, Elberfeld, d. ca. 1718, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schenck/biograph.html,"
Dutch mapmaker and publisher. Born in Elberfeld, Germany in 1660, he moved to Amsterdam in 1683 where he became a pupil of Gerard Valck. He soon became an extremely skilled exponent of the so-called zwarte kunst (mezzotint engraving). In 1686 he is noted in a privilege granted to Petrus Schenck and Gerardus Valck for the printing and sale of their prints. The best known of the joint Pieter Schenk and Gerard Valck publications were the second edition of Andreas Cellarius's Celestial Atlas Harmonia Macrocosmica [1708] and an edition of Jan Jansson's Novus Atlas entitled the Atlas Anglois published in London by David Mortier in 1715."
4484,"SCHIAFFINO, Francesco Maria","(b. 1688, Genova, d. 1763, Genova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schiaffi/biograph.html,"
Sculptor, part of an Italian family of sculptors, brother of Bernardo Schiaffino. He was the pupil and then assistant of Bernardo, who in 1721 sent him to complete his training in Rome, where he entered the workshop of Camillo Rusconi. He remained there until 1724, enriching his technique and cultural education by studying the works of Bernini, Rusconi and other sculptors. Back in Genoa, he executed such works as St Dominic (Genoa, Teatro Carlo Felice), in which Rusconi’s influence is evident. The marble group of Pluto and Proserpine, sculpted for the Durazzo family and still in its original location (Genoa, Palazzo Reale), is based on a bozzetto by Rusconi."
4485,"SCHIAVO, Paolo","(b. 1397, Firenze, d. 1478, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schiavo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Paolo di Stefano Badaloni. He enrolled in the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in Florence in 1429. According to Vasari, he was a follower of Masolino; this is confirmed by those works securely attributable to him, though they date from a later phase of his activity. They include a signed and dated fresco of the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (1436; Florence, San Miniato al Monte); a fresco of the Crucifixion Adored by Nuns (1447-48; Florence, convent of Sant'Apollonia), also signed and dated; a panel of the Assumption (1460) and frescoes of the Adoration of the Magi, the Annunciation and various saints (all Quarto, nr Florence, Santa Maria Assunta). Other frescoes include Stories of St Stephen (c. 1436-40; Collegiata, Castiglione Olona); frescoes in the left-hand chapel of the church of San Michele a Castellaccio di Sommaia, near Florence; and a signed Virgin and Child with Saints (Monte San Michele, Greve in Chianti). Two street tabernacles by Schiavo survive: the Tabernacolo delle Mozzette, near San Piero a Sieve, contains a Virgin and Child with Saints (c. 1437-38) while the Tabernacolo dell'Olmo at Castello, near Florence, bears an Annunciation and Saints (1447)."
4486,"SCHIAVONE, Andrea","(b. ca. 1515, Zara, d. 1563, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schiavon/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher (original name Andrea Meldolla). His nickname ""Schiavone"" means Slav, reflecting the fact that he came from Zara, Dalmatia (then under Venetian jurisdiction). He worked mainly in Venice, where he was on friendly terms with Titian (who along with Parmigianino was one of the main influences on his style). His most characteristic works were small-scale religious or mythological scenes for private patrons in a vigorous, painterly style.

4487,"SCHIAVONE, Giorgio","(b. ca. 1436, Scardone, d, 1504, Sebenico)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schiavox/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of Dalmatian origin (Giorgio Culinoviç). He was the best follower of the style of Francesco Squarcione with whom he studied from 1456 in Padua where he had contacts with the sculptors who followed Donatello. Among his main works, all datable around 1460 when he was in Dalmatia, are the polyptych with Madonna, Child and Saints (National Gallery, London) signed as a disciple of Squarcione, Madonna and Child Enthroned (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), Madonna and Child (Galleria Sabauda, Turin), Madonna and Child (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore), and Portrait of a Man (Muséee Jacquemart-André, Paris).

"
4489,"SCHICK, Christian Gottlieb","(b. 1776, Stuttgart, d. 1812, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schick/biograph.html,"
German painter. He trained at the Höhe Karlsschule in Stuttgart (1795-97) under the classically-orientated painter Philipp Friedrich von Hetsch (1758-1839), a pupil of David. Schick also took private lessons (1797-98) with the sculptor Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. From 1799 to 1802 he studied in Paris under David, and he soon became one of David's favourite students. He made two unsuccessful attempts to win the Prix de Rome with compositions that derived from the style of David. However, greater independence is seen in his life-size painting Eve (1800; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne), an allegory of Beauty synthesizing a classically-orientated reinterpretation of ancient art and a proto-Romantic interpretation of biblical subject-matter, inspired by Milton's Paradise Lost. As Schick himself stated (letter to Dannecker, 10 July 1800), he had tried to emulate both the Medici Venus and the female figures of Raphael."
4490,"SCHICKHARDT, Heinrich II","(b. 1558, Herrenberg, d. 1635, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schickha/biograph.html,"
German architect. He came from a family of craftsmen: his grandfather, Heinrich Schickhardt I (1464-1540), was a wood-carver and his father, Lukas Schickhardt I (1511-1585), was a wood-carver, master builder and clerk of works. After a five-year apprenticeship as a joiner and a period as a journeyman, Heinrich Schickhardt II was employed from 1578 by Georg Beer (1527-1600), then Land Architect of Württemberg, preparing wooden models of new building projects and carving organ fronts and memorial plaques. By 1586 he had progressed to working independently, building town houses and noblemen's castles; during 1586-89 he was responsible for the new ashlar façade, in the style of the German Renaissance, on the old half-timbered town hall of Esslingen."

"
4492,"SCHINKEL, Karl Friedrich","(b. 1781, Neuruppin, d. 1841, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schinkel/biograph.html,"
German architect, painter, and designer, active mainly in Berlin. Schinkel was the greatest German architect of the 19th century, but until 1815, when he gained a senior appointment in the Public Works Department of Prussia (from which position he effectively redesigned Berlin), he worked mainly as a painter and stage designer. His paintings are highly Romantic landscapes somewhat in the spirit of Friedrich, although more anecdotal in detail (Gothic Cathedral by a River, Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1813-14). He continued working as a stage designer until the 1830s, and in this field ranks among the greatest artists of his period. His most famous designs were for Mozart's The Magic Flute (1815), in which he combined the clarity and logic of his architectural style with a feeling of mystery and fantasy.

4493,"SCHLAUN, Johann Conrad","(b. 1695, Paderborn, d. 1773, Münster)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schlaun/biograph.html,"
German architect. Most of his works are in Westphalia, his earliest buildings were uncomplicated churches. In 1719 he was appointed Land Surveyor of Münster by Clemens August (1700-1761), Prince Bishop of Paderborn and Münster, who encouraged him to travel, first to Würzburg where he gained further experience under Balthasar Neumann, before visiting Italy and France in order to broaden his architectural knowledge."

Martin Johann Schmidt (so-called Kremser Schmidt) was the most significant Austrian painter in the second half of the 18th century beside Maulbertsch. He was a versatile and fertile master, whose frescoes, altarpieces, mythological-allegorical paintings, genre paintings, and portraits were popular throughout the Empire. He studied with modest local masters, and lived and worked in Stein and Krems until his death in 1801. In his stein workshop he undertook the numerous mostly ecclesiastical commissions making altarpieces and religious paintings for the churches and monasteries of Lower an Upper Austria, Moravia and Hungary. His fame was attested by his admission to the Viennese Academy in 1768."
4496,"SCHNETZ, Jean-Victor","(b. 1787, Versailles, d. 1870, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schnetz/biograph.html,"
French painter and printmaker. He trained first under Jacques-Louis David and then under Jean-Baptiste Regnault, Antoine-Jean Gros and François Gérard. He made his début at the Salon in 1808 and exhibited there until 1867. It was in 1819, however, that he established his reputation by winning the gold medal for history painting. The following year he exhibited one of his most important paintings, A Gypsy Predicting the Future of Sixte-Quinte (1820; untraced). After this there followed a number of paintings on historical and religious subjects such as General Condé at the Battle of Rocroy (1824; Versailles, Château), Eudes, Comte de Paris, Raising the Siege of Paris in 886 (1837; Versailles, Château) and Procession of Crusaders around Jerusalem the Day Before the Taking of the Town, 14 July 1099 (1841; Versailles, Château)."

German painter and illustrator. After studying at the Vienna Academy he joined the Nazarenes in Rome (1817-25) and with them painted frescos in the Casino Massimo. In 1827 he moved to Munich, where he worked for Ludwig I, painting mainly frescos in the royal palace. As head of the Dresden Academy from 1846 onwards, Schnorr exercised a considerable influence in Germany as a representative of Nazarene ideals. He was famous in his day for his Bible illustrations, which were also published in England (Schnorr's Bible Pictures, 1860).

Johann Nepomuk Schödlberger was an Austrian landscape painter, who was described as an ""undaunted producer of ideal landscapes in the age of Realism."" A native of Vienna, Schödlberger enjoyed great success in his profession. He became member of the Vienna Academy in 1815. Between 1813 and 1822 his landscapes dominated the exhibitions at the Academy."

German still-life and portrait painter. He was born in Frankfurt where he studied at the Städelsches Kunstinstitut with Johann David Passavant (1787-1861) and Jacob Becker (1810-1872). Subsequently, Scholderer established himself in Städel as a freelance painter. During this period his friendship with Victor Müller (1829-1871) began; Scholderer became his brother-in-law in 1868."
4501,"SCHÖN, Erhard","(b. ca. 1491, Nürnberg, d. 1542, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schon/biograph.html,"
German woodcut designer and painter. He was the son of Marx Schön III, a minor Nuremberg painter, with whom he probably began his training. Then he studied Albrecht Dürer's prints while living in the artist's house for several years. Scholars have attributed some 1,200 illustrations for 116 books and about 200 separate woodcuts to Erhard Schön, making him one of the era's most prolific woodblock designers. His works enjoyed tremendous popularity."

Lorenz Adolf Schönberger (also Schoenberger) was an Austrian landscape painter working in the style of Claude Lorrain. After his study at the Vienna Art Academy with Johann Christian Brand, he travelled in Central Europe, lived and worked in Paris (1804), in Frankfurt am Main (1810), in Rome (1817-25), in Holland (1826) and in England (1840).

4503,"SCHÖNFELD, Johann Heinrich","(b. 1609, Biberach an der Riss, d. 1683, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schonfel/biograph.html,"
German painter and etcher. His early career is not well documented; he spent about a decade in Italy (mainly Rome and Naples) as a young man, but it is only after he settled in Augsburg in 1652 that his development can be traced through dated works. He was versatile and prolific, painting historical and genre subjects as well as many altarpieces for churches in southern  Germany. His style was lively and eclectic, drawing on various Italian influences, in his delicate colouring and lightness of touch he anticipates elements of German Rococo art.



"
4504,"SCHONGAUER, Ludwig","(b. ca. 1450, Colmar, d. 1494, Colmar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schongau/ludwig/biograph.html,"
German painter, printmaker and draftsman, younger brother of the better-known Martin Schongauer. He was born into a family of goldsmiths, painters, and printmakers, and he most likely apprenticed with Caspar Isenmann (active c. 1430-1484). Ludwig Schongauer became a citizen of Ulm in 1479 and of Augsburg in 1486, and he returned to Colmar after the death of his brother, Martin. His small oeuvre comprises paintings, prints, and a group of drawings of the Passion of Christ. The attribution of those works is based on his signed engravings.

4505,"SCHONGAUER, Martin","(b. ca. 1430, Colmar, d. 1491, Breisach)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schongau/martin/biograph.html,"
German engraver and painter, active in Colmar, Alsace. In his day he was probably the most famous artist in Germany; it was in his workshop that the young Dürer hoped to study, but when he arrived in Colmar in 1492 the master had recently died. Only one painting certainly by Schongauer survives - Madonna in the Rose Garden (St Martin's, Colmar, 1473) - and he is remembered chiefly as an engraver, the greatest of his period.

"
4506,"SCHOOR, Aelbert Jansz. van der","(b. ca. 1603, Utrecht, d. ca. 1672, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schoor/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Little is known about this artist. He is documented in Utrecht between 1620 and 1672, but also in Dordrecht and perhaps in Enkhuizen. Working as a painter of still-lifes, historical scenes and genre pieces, the artist also executed at least 12 portraits, all dated between 1642 and 1651. His style is undoubtedly indebted to Abraham Bloemaert.

4507,"SCHOOTEN, Floris Gerritsz. van","(b. ca. 1590, Haarlem, d. after 1655, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schooten/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. His considerable output of still-life paintings covers a variety of styles and formats reflecting different influences. His large market or kitchen scenes, with or without figures, showing an abundance of produce (e.g. 1634; Brunswick, Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum), clearly belong to the tradition of Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. Van Schooten's breakfast-pieces, with an accumulation of items on a table top, tilted towards the spectator and covered with rugs or white damask cloths, are often inseparable from those of his Haarlem contemporaries Nicholaes Gillis and Floris van Dijck. These horizontal panels, with cheese, hams, bread, all on separate pewter or porcelain plates, with vertical accents from tankards, salt-cellars and wine glasses, gradually evolved towards smaller-scale still-lifes with simplified content (e.g. Haarlem, Frans Halsmuseum). This signals a transition from his early style towards that of the younger Haarlem masters of the monochrome breakfast-pieces, Pieter Claesz. and Willem Heda."
4508,"SCHÖPFER, Hans the Elder","(b. ca. 1505, d. 1569, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schopfer/biograph.html,"
German painter. He studied (1520-25) with Wolfgang Mielich (fl 1506-41) and is mentioned in the records of the Munich painters' guild in 1531; in 1538 they elected him their leader. Schöpfer, a native Bavarian, came to Munich from Nuremberg and was primarily active as a portrait painter. His work rivalled that of Barthel Beham, though it was more primitive, weaker on anatomy, rougher in draughtsmanship, but mellower in colouring."
4509,"SCHOPIN, Frédéric-Henri","(b. 1804, Lübeck, d. 1880, Montigny-sur-Loing)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schopin/biograph.html,"

Hans Schor (1585-1674), probably the son of the portrait painter Johann Schor, was a versatile painter and designer in Innsbruck in the earlier 17th century. His three sons, Johann Paul Schor, Bonaventura Schor (1624-1692) and Egid Schor (1627-1701), trained as painters in Rome, where Johann Paul and Egid worked on frescoes in the Palazzo del Quirinale under Pietro da Cortona."

Flemish painter, active in Germany and Italy. Although he never visited the southern Netherlands, he is nevertheless regarded as belonging to the Flemish school. His father, Nicolaes Schoubroeck, was a Protestant clergyman who moved from Flanders to Frankenthal in 1586 to escape religious persecution. His mother, Clarken de Wale, was also from the southern Netherlands. Moreover, Pieter belonged to the community of Flemish artists known as the Frankenthal School. It is generally assumed that, while working there, he became a pupil of Gillis van Coninxloo."

In his spare time he took drawing classes and studied with Paul Baudry (1828-1886) and Carolus-Duran, making his début at the Salon in 1874. He also became acquainted with Armand Guillaumin and Camille Pissarro. Following the stock market crash of 1882, he, like Gauguin, was forced to leave Bertin's and gained a job teaching art at the Lycée Michelet in Vanves."

Schultz learned the art of painting from his uncle, Daniel Schultz the Elder (died 1646), another important painter, working in his workshop for about five years. After his uncle's death he went to France and the Netherlands to continue his studies for about three years (1646-49) and was clearly influenced by the work of Rembrandt, Frans Snyders and Jan Fyt. He lived in Warsaw from 1649 to 1660, closely tied to the court, before moving back to Gdansk; like Rubens, he added clandestine diplomatic missions to his artistic duties."

Jacques (Jacob) van Schuppen was a French painter of Flemish descent, active in Austria. After training with his father and Nicolas de Largillière, he worked for five years at the ducal court in Lorraine at Lunéville before arriving in Vienna in 1713, where he settled. Here he sought the patronage of Prince Eugene of Savoy, but ultimately obtained this from Count Gundacker Althan. It was not until 1721 that he was introduced to the imperial Court and subsequently appointed Kammermaler. In 1726 he was appointed director  of the Academy by Emperor Karl VI. He developed the Academy after the model of the Royal Academy in Paris.

German sculptor and medallist. He was probably a descendant of Ulrich Schwarz, a burgomaster of Augsburg, and at some time after 1506 trained as a wood-carver under Stephan Schwarz (fl. 1493-1535; possibly a relative) in Augsburg, where the dominant artistic influence was the work of Hans Burgkmair I. He then began making portrait medals of Augsburg's leading citizens. Schwarz first sketched his subjects with clear strokes, defining their individual features, then carved a wooden model with the profile and an inscription, finally casting a medal in bronze or lead. In 1519, after only three years of experience as a medallist, Schwarz was invited to Nuremberg in Bavaria. In 1520 Schwarz was expelled from Nuremberg for unruly behavior. Thereafter he lived an itinerant existence, dying sometime after 1521."
4523,"SCHWARZ, Christoph","(b. ca. 1548, München, d. 1592, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schwarz1/biograph.html,"
German painter and draughtsman. He was the son of a Munich goldsmith, Conrad Schwarz (active 1540s), and was apprenticed to Hans II Bocksberger (c. 1530-after 1583) from 1560 to c. 1566. In 1568 he worked on festive decorations for the marriage of Prince William (later Duke) of Bavaria and Duchess Renata of Lorraine together with Hans Mielich, the master in charge, and Hans Ostendorfer II (d. ca. 1570). He also assisted Mielich on paintings for the High Altar (1560-72; in situ) of the Liebfrauenkirche, Ingolstadt. In 1569 he was awarded his master's certificate and citizenship of Munich."
4524,"SCHWIND, Moritz von","(b. 1804, Wien, d. 1871, Niederpöcking)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/schwind/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, graphic artist, and designer, trained in Vienna and in Munich under Cornelius. Schwind represents the tail-end of Germanic Romanticism and his most characteristic works depict an idealized fairy-tale Middle Ages, with knights in armour, damsels in distress, enchanted woods and castles, and much loving depiction of costume, architecture, etc. He was at his best working on a small scale, as in his numerous book illustrations and his woodcuts for Fliegende Blotter, a humorous Munich periodical. In his young days Schwind, who was an accomplished violinist, had been friendly with Franz Schubert and late in his own life he depicted Schubert's Vienna circle in a number of drawings.



"
4525,"SCIORINA, Lorenzo dello",(active c. 1568 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sciorina/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied under Bronzino, and afterwards assisted Vasari in some of his works in Florence. It is said that honourable mention is made of him among the academicians of Florence.



"
4526,"SCKELL, Friedrich Ludwig von","(b. 1750, Weilburg an der Lahn, d. 1823, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sckell/biograph.html,"
German landscape architect. He is regarded as the founder of the English gardens in Germany, which he introduced to the German experts with his writings on garden design. His manner of grouping and choice of plants is still used to an extent in German landscaping today."
4527,"SCOREL, Jan van","(b. 1495, Schoorl, d. 1562, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scorel/biograph.html,"
Jan van Scorel (Schoorel), the first Dutch painter of importance to study in Italy and responsible for introducing the Italian High Renaissance to the Netherlands. He was widely travelled and was appointed by Pope Hadrian VI superintendent of the Vatican Coll. In Rome he was influenced by Michelangelo and Raphael, particularly the latter. He returned to the Netherlands in 1524. His works include Pilgrims to Jerusalem, St Mary Magdalen and Holy Kinship.



"
4528,"SCOTT, Samuel","(b. ca. 1702, London, d. 1772, Bath)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scott/biograph.html,"
English marine and topographical painter and etcher. He began as a marine painter in the tradition of the van de Veldes, but he turned to topographical views in the manner of Canaletto, who was then enjoying great success in England. He was not simply a mechanical imitator, however, and had a feeling for the English atmosphere that is lacking in Canaletto, who brought the Venetian light with him to England. Scott also could achieve a distinctive grandeur of design, as in an Arch of Westminster Bridge (Tate Gallery, London), which is often considered his masterpiece. He left London in 1765 and settled in Bath for reason of health, evidently painting little in his later years.



"
4529,"SCOTT, William Bell","(b. 1811, Edinburgh, d. 1890, Penkill Castle)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scott_wb/biograph.html,"
Member of a Scottish family of painters, son of Robert Scott (1771-1841), an illustrator and engraver, and brother of David Scott, a painter and engraver."
4530,"SCOTTI, Gottardo","(active in 1454-1485, Milan)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scotti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Milan. In his time he was a highly regarded and much engaged painter. He was active in the Cathedral and in the Castello, where he collaborated with Bonifazio Bembo and Constantino da Vaprio. In Pavia, he was the partner of Stefano de' Fedeli and others.



"
4531,"SCROTS, Guillaume",(active 1537-1553 in England),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scrots/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, active in England. In 1537 he was appointed court painter to Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands, but no work done for her has yet been identified. By autumn 1545 he had arrived in England to enter the service of Henry VIII as King's Painter, at the extraordinarily high salary of £62 10s a year - about twice what his predecessor Hans Holbein the Younger had received. Scrots, whose work reflected the grand formality of Habsburg portraiture, went on to produce highly fashionable portraits at the English court."
4532,"SCULTORI, Diana","(b. ca. 1547, Mantova, d. 1612, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/scultori/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver, also known as Diana Mantovana. She came from a family of artists, her father, Giovanni Battista Mantovano, was a sculptor and engraver, who worked with Giulio Romano at the Palazzo del Tè in Mantua. The surname Scultori was assumed for her during the nineteenth century by art historians. Originally scholars recorded her name as Diana Ghisi based upon a mistaken relationship to the engraver Giorgio Ghisi. Diana most often signed her own work ""Diana Mantuana"" or ""Diana Mantovana."""
4533,SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO,"(b. 1485, Venezia, d. 1547, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sebastia/biograph.html,"
Sebastiano del Piombo (originally Sebastiano Luciani), Venetian painter, active mainly in Rome. According to Vasari, he trained with Giovanni Bellini, but his early work was most strongly influenced by Giorgione, whose Three Philosophers (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) Sebastiano is said to have completed after the master's death. Their styles, indeed, can be so close as to cause paintings to be disputed between them, most notably the unfinished Judgment of Solomon (National Trust, Kingston Lacy). This large and impressive work was attributed to Giorgione by Ridolfi, but scholarly opinion now increasingly tends towards giving it to Sebastiano. The half-length Salome (or Judith?) (National Gallery, London, 1510) shows the magnificent painterly skills of an undoubted work of Sebastiano at this date; it has a sensuous beauty reminiscent of Giorgione, but also a statuesque grandeur that is Sebastiano's own.

"
4534,"SEDDON, Thomas III","(b. 1821, London, d. 1856, Cairo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seddon/biograph.html,"
English painter and furniture designer, part of a family of artists and craftsmen, active 18th-early 20th century. He was the great-grandchild of George Seddon I (c. 1727-1801), grandchild of Thomas Seddon I (1761-1804), and child of Thomas Seddon II (1792-1864), all furniture makers."
4535,"SEEMAN, Enoch","(b. ca. 1694, Danzig, d. 1744, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seeman/biograph.html,"
English painter. His father Enoch Seeman the Elder (b c. 1661), a painter of Flemish origin, brought him to London in 1704. The younger Seeman's earliest known painting is Colonel Andrew Bisset and his Family (Castle Forbes, Grampian), an ambitious group portrait of somewhat uneven quality, in the manner of Godfrey Kneller. From 1717 Seeman enjoyed royal patronage, executing a full-length portrait of George I in coronation robes (c. 1730; London, Middle Temple); this patronage was sustained through the late 1730s with a portrait of George II (Windsor Castle, Royal Collection). In 1717 he painted the well-known full-length portrait of Elihu Yale (New Haven, CT, Yale University Art Gallery), and in 1738 an exceptionally lively portrait of Sir James Dashwood (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art)."
4536,"SEGANTINI, Giovanni","(b. 1858, Arco, d. 1899, Schafberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/segantin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Born in 1858 in Arco, in the province of Trient, on the northern bank of Lake Garda, Giovanni Segantini attended the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. Subsequently, he lived in the Brianza region, and then moved to Switzerland in 1886. He first settled with his family in Savognin, but from 1894 he was based in Maloja and Soglio. Segantini died of peritonitis in 1899, at the early age of 41, while working on the middle section of his Alpine Triptych, Nature, on the Schafberg high above Pontresina."
4537,"SEGAR, Sir William","(d. 1633, Richmond, Surrey)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/segar/biograph.html,"
English herald and painter. He is said to have been trained as a scrivener and may have been a son of Francis Nycholson, alias Seager, who became a freeman of the Stationers' Company in 1557. William Segar entered the College of Arms under the patronage of Sir Thomas Heneage in 1585; he was appointed to the principal office, Garter King of Arms, in 1607 and was knighted in 1616. His career as a herald is well documented and some fine examples of his heraldic painting survive (especially London, British Library). In 1590 he published anonymously a heraldic treatise, the Booke of Honor and Armes, and in 1602 he brought out an expanded and illustrated version, dedicated to Queen Elizabeth I and entitled Honor, Military and Civill."
4538,"SEGHERS, Corneille","(b. 1814, Antwerpen, d. 1869, Schaerbeek)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seghers/corneill/biograph.html,"
Corneille-Jean-Adrien Seghers, Belgian painter. He studied in Antwerp. In 1844 he moved to Brussels where he completed portraits and other paintings, most of which were ordered by buyers in Germany and Britain, but that also included works completed for wealthy city residents. His etchings, done in a style imitative of Rembrandt, enjoyed considerable success.



"
4539,"SEGHERS, Daniel","(b. 1590, Antwerpen, d. 1661, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seghers/daniel/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder in Antwerp. He became free master of the Antwerp Guild of Painters in 1614, while at the same time joining the Jesuit Order as a lay brother. He made numerous trips abroad, including Rome. He painted for Prince Frederick Hendrick of Nassau and the Elector of Brandenburg.



"
4540,"SEGHERS, Gerard","(b. 1591, Antwerpen, d. 1651, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seghers/gerard/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of religious subjects, active mainly in his native Antwerp, where he is said to have been taught by Janssens. At some time between 1611 and 1620 he travelled in Italy (and probably also in Spain) and he became one of the very few noteworthy Flemish Caravaggesque artists. By the time he painted the Assumption of the Virgin (Musée de Peinture et de Sculpture, Grenoble, 1629), however, he had fallen under the all-pervasive influence of Rubens. Seghers had a successful career supplying altarpieces for churches in Antwerp and Ghent and also enjoyed considerable patronage from clients in Spain.

4541,"SEGHERS, Hercules","(b. ca. 1590, Haarlem, d. ca. 1638, The Hague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seghers/hercules/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher of stark, fantastic landscapes."
4542,SEGNA DI BUONAVENTURE,"(doc. 1298, Siena, d. ca. 1331, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/segna/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is seemingly documented from December 1298 to May 1326, but the evidence is ambiguous and may refer to more than one artist. In 1306 he was paid 10 lire for a painted panel for the office of the Biccherna in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena. According to a 17th-century copy of notices from the convent of Lecceto (near Siena), Segna received 4 florins in partial payment for an altar panel in December 1317. He was resident in the parish of San Pietro Ovile, Siena, in 1316 and 1318 and in Arezzo on 21 July 1319; he was again working in Siena by 8 November 1319 because he then received 8 lire for repairing a figure of the Virgin in the Palazzo Pubblico. On 27 August 1321 he apparently received a payment (1 lira, 11 soldi) for a panel on which were inscribed the articuli fidei for the Palazzo Pubblico."
4543,"SEISENEGGER, Jacob",(1504/05 - 1567),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seiseneg/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, chiefly a portraitist. In 1531 he became court painter to the emperor Ferdinand I at Augsburg and he worked much for the Habsburg family. He was a painter of modest talent, but has some importance in the development of the full-length portrait; his famous work is the full-length portrait of Charles V (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which served as a model for the more famous one by Titian (Prado, Madrid). Seisenegger travelled widely, working in Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, as well as in various cities in Central Europe: Innsbruck, Prague, Vienna.



"
4544,"SEITER, Daniel","(b. 1647, Wien, d. 1705, Torino)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seiter/biograph.html,"
Daniel Seiter (Saiter; Seutter; Seyter; Syder), Austrian painter and draughtsman, active in Italy, where he was called Cavalier Daniele or Daniele Fiammingo). He brought an art combining the influences of Johann Carl Loth, Pietro da Cortona and Carlo Maratti to the Savoy court in Turin."
4545,"SELLAER, Vincent","(active 1538-1544, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sellaer/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter who lived in Flanders in the 16th century, and specialized in the painting of nude women, such as Cleopatra, Suzanna, Leda and Judith. Van Mander referred to a painter in Mechelen named Vincent Geldersman who painted a half-length figure of Leda, a Susanna, a Cleopatra with the asp and 'other such things of which very many copies are to be seen'. Contemporary inventories confirm the identification of Geldersman with Sellaer. It is probable that two, possibly three, generations of painters bore the name and are traceable in the documentation."
4546,"SEMENTI, Giovanni Giacomo","(b. 1583, Bologna, d. ca. 1638, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sementi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Giovanni Giacomo Semenza. He was a pupil of Denis Calvaert, then of Guido Reni. He was inspired by Reni and imitated his work with great skill. This is possibly a contributory factor in his success. He executed numerous works in the churches of Bologna, in particular a Marriage of St Catherine, and a Christ the Redeemer (in Santa Caterina)."
4547,"SEMITECOLO, Nicoletto",(active 1353-1370),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/semiteco/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is first recorded in a Venetian document of 1353, and he may have had some initial training in Venice. An unsigned panel of the Coronation of the Virgin (1355; Madrid, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza) has been cited as evidence of the formative impact of Paolo Veneziano although it reflects neither Paolo's nor Semitecolo's own later style."
4548,"SEMPER, Gottfried","(b. 1803, Altona, d. 1879, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/semper/biograph.html,"
German architect. He studied in Rome, Munich and Paris. In 1826 he went to France to work under the architect François Chrétien Gau (1790-1853) and in Paris he witnessed the July Revolution of 1830. Between 1830 and 1833 he studied the architecture of Greece and Italy in those countries, including a four month study of the Acropolis in Athens."
4549,"SENGHER, Filippo",(active 1675-1704 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sengher/biograph.html,"
Filippo Sengher of Bavarian origin (Philip Senger) was the court-turner of ivory for the Medici in Florence. He introduced the Grand Prince Ferdinando de' Medici himself to the art of ivory turning, training him in the time-consuming work.



"
4550,"SERAFINI, Serafino","(b. ca. 1324, Modena, d. ca. 1393, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serafini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was born into a Modenese family of brick and terracotta manufacturers. Although associated with the brother of the artist Tommaso da Modena as early as 1346, he appears to have been involved with terracotta manufacture in the 1350s, a medium already associated with relief sculpture in Emilia. By 1361 he had moved to Ferrara, ruled, like Modena, by the Este family. By 1375 he was working at their court in Ferrara, whence he was summoned to work for the Gonzaga family in Mantua. For them he painted most of the frescoes of the Life of St Louis of Toulouse and the Passion (San Francesco, Mantua), although they were probably designed by Tommaso. The expressively characterized faces and plasticity of the figures clearly show Tommaso's inspiration, and the influence of the illuminator Niccolò di Giacomo da Bologna can also be seen.



"
4551,"SERGEL, Johan Tobias","(b. 1740, Stockholm, d. 1814, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sergel/biograph.html,"Swedish sculptor, active mainly in Stockholm. His early works are in the French Rococo style, but he abandoned this during the period he spent in Rome (1767-78) and became the leading Swedish exponent of Neoclassicism. He was a much livelier artist than many Neoclassical sculptors, however, and although his mature work has impressive clarity of form, it also possesses warmth and vitality.

"
4552,"SERLIO, Sebastiano","(b. 1475, Bologna, d. ca. 1554, Fontainebleau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serlio/biograph.html,"

4553,"SERMARTELLI, Bartolomeo",(active 1563-1600 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sermarte/biograph.html,"
Italian printmaker and publisher. He run a printshop (the Stamperia del Sermartelli) in Florence. He was the son of Michelangelo de' Libri; he added to his name the last name of his patron, who belonged to the Martelli family."
4554,"SERODINE, Giovanni","(b. 1600, Ascona, d. 1630, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serodine/biograph.html,"Italian painter, born at Ascona in the Ticino, he was a solitary and eccentric figure on the post-Caravaggio scene. Like so many from his part of the world, he left the Lombard valleys to find work in Rome where he arrived in about 1615. Rather than following in the footsteps of his father and brother, both famous plaster-decorators, Serodine tried instead to make a name for himself as a painter. His temperament was diametrically opposed to the classical school and it was not long before he found himself marginalized. He only obtained a handful of commissions (including The Charity of St Lawrence in the abbey at Casamari). These all illustrate his harsh, dramatic style, which was even more direct and brutal than Caravaggio's. He worked with rapid brushstrokes, as if wielding a saber, far removed from the polished grace of the Emilian school.

"
4555,"SÉROUX D'AGINCOURT, Jean-Baptiste","(b. 1730, Beauvais, d. 1814, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seroux/biograph.html,"
French art historian, collector, and author. Born in Beauvais, he was a descendant of the counts of Namur, and in his youth served as an officer in a regiment of cavalry. Finding it necessary to quit the army in order to take charge of his younger brothers who had been left orphans, he was appointed a farmer-general by Louis XV. In 1777 he visited England, Germany and the Dutch Republic; and in the following year he travelled through Italy, with the view of exploring thoroughly the remains of ancient art. He afterwards settled in Rome and devoted himself to preparing the results of his researches for publication."
4556,"SEROV, Valentin","(b. 1865, St. Petersburg, d. 1911, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serov/biograph.html,"
Russian painter, graphic artist and stage designer. As a child he lived in St Petersburg, but he made frequent trips abroad. In 1874 he travelled to Paris with his mother and frequented the studio of the Russian Realist painter, Ilya Repin. In 1875 the art patron Savva Mamontov invited Serov and his mother to settle at Abramtsevo outside Moscow, where he again had the opportunity to study under Repin and to meet other artists in the Mamontov circle. The Symbolist paintings of Mikhail Vrubel' and the late Impressionist landscapes and figure studies of Konstantin Korovin he saw at Abramtsevo had a lasting influence on the young Serov."
4557,"SERPOTTA, Giacomo","(b. 1652, Palermo, d. 1732, Palermo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serpotta/biograph.html,"
Sicilian sculptor in stucco. He was the greatest of all virtuosi in his medium and with the exception of Antonello da Messina, the most distinguished artist to come from Sicily. Unlike Antonello, he spent almost all his life on the island (although he may have trained in Rome) and his work is mainly found in the churches of his native Palermo."
4558,"SERRA, Jaume",(d. after 1405),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serra/jaume/biograph.html,"
Serra Jaume (d. after 1405) and Pere (active 1363-1399), the most important Catalan painters of the late 14th century. They continued the Sienese tradition introduced by Ferrer Bassa. Pere's altarpiece The Holy Spirit in Manresa cathedral is a fine example of their work.

"
4560,"SERRES, Dominic","(b. 1722, Auch, d. 1793, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serres/biograph.html,"
French marine painter, part of a family of painters and draughtsmen, active in England. Dominic Serres had at least five children: three daughters, all of whom were amateur painters (mostly in watercolours), and two sons, also painters: Dominic M. Serres (c. 1761-after 1804) and John Thomas Serres (1759-1825)."
4561,"SÉRUSIER, Paul","(b. 1864, Paris, d. 1927, Morlaix)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serusier/biograph.html,"
French painter, who was a pioneer of abstract art and an inspiration for the avant-garde movement Les Nabis, Synthetism and Cloisonnism. In the summer of 1888 he travelled to Pont-Aven and joined the small group of artists centred there around Paul Gauguin, whose style he adhered to, particularly in his paintings of Breton landscapes. With Maurice Denis, Sérusier was a founder and spokesman of the Nabis. Sérusier had a highly methodical approach to art; he expressed his theories in ABC de la peinture (1921).



"
4562,"SERVANDONI, Giovanni Niccolò","(b. 1697, Firenze, d. 1766, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/servando/biograph.html,"
French architect, painter and stage designer. He was born either in Florence or Lyon, to an Italian mother and a French father, who was a coach driver between the two cities. He began his career as an artist c. 1715 in Rome, where he knew the vedute painter Giovanni Paolo Pannini, and he was taught drawing and perspective by the architectural engraver Giuseppe Ignazio Rossi (d. before 1739)."
4563,"SERWOUTERS, Pieter","(b. 1586, Antwerpen, d. 1657, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/serwoute/biograph.html,"
Flemish engraver. He worked in Amsterdam from 1622 and died there in 1657. He was a skilful engraver who not only worked after designs by other artists such as David Vinckboons and Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne, but also after his own designs. His portraits are, in particular, very fine.



"
4564,"SEURAT, Georges","(b. 1859, Paris, d. 1891, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seurat/biograph.html,"
French painter. A key Post-Impressionist painter, Georges Seurat moved away from the apparent spontaneity and rapidity of Impressionism and developed a structured, more monumental art to depict modern urban life. For several of his large compositions, Seurat painted many small studies."
4565,"SEYBOLD, Christian","(b. ca. 1690, Mainz, d. 1768, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seybold/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Austria. He went to Vienna in his youth and, apparently self-taught, became a portrait-painter. His earliest known work, surviving only in an engraving (1728) by Andreas Schmutzer and Josef Schmutzer, is a portrait of Graf Johann Adam Questenberg in the formal Baroque style. Subsequently, under the influence of Balthasar Denner, he turned to a more intimate style of representation, mainly in simple half-length or head-and-shoulders portraits. He was influenced by Rembrandt both directly through the study of his works and also through Jan Kupecky who worked in Vienna for a time.



"
4566,"SEYMOUR, James","(b. ca. 1702, London, d. 1752, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/seymour/biograph.html,"
English painter and draughtsman. The son of James Seymour (d. 1739), a dealer in pictures and precious metals, Seymour was among the first English painters to specialize exclusively in sporting subject-matter. Though he possibly received some informal drawing instruction from the topographer Francis Place, Seymour was essentially a self-taught artist whose education was based on the study of pictures that passed through his father's hands; one of his earliest known works is a sketch of a horse's head after van Dyck."
4567,"SFERINI, Carlo Leopoldo","(b. 1652, d. 1698, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sferini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, called Carlo Tedesco, probably of German origin, active in Verona. He was long considered as a quadratura painter and a painter of figural frescoes working in churches and villas in the Veneto, particularly in Verona and its surroundings. He was also acknowledged as a skilled draughtsman. A trompe-l'oeil still-life assigned to him was first published in 1989, and it served as the starting point for identifying other still-lifes by him. It is now clear that alongside Domenico Remps, also of northern origin and active in the Veneto, Sferini was the earliest exponent of the independent trompe-l'oeil genre in Italy.

Russian sculptor. The son of an Imperial Guardsman, he studied from 1764 to 1772 at the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg under Nicolas-François Gillet. After winning a scholarship he continued his training in France and Rome, including a period of study in Paris (1775-84) under Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain. Early in his career he progressed from a Baroque style (e.g. Marsyas, bronze, 1776) to a mixture of Baroque and classical (e.g. Endymion Sleeping, bronze, 1779), becoming predominantly Neo-classical only from the 1790s (e.g. Venus, marble, 1792; all St Petersburg, Russian Museum)."

Painter, part of a Russian family of artists, son of Feodosy Shchedrin, a well-known sculptor, professor and assistant rector of the Academy of Arts. His uncle Semyon, a professor of landscape painting, gave the young Silvestr his first lessons. He studied at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, and in 1811 graduated with a gold medal."
4572,"SHEE, Sir Martin Archer","(b. 1769, Dublin, d. 1850, Brighton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/shee/biograph.html,"
Irish painter and writer, active in England. He received a Classical education before entering the Drawing Academy of the Royal Dublin Society, where his master was Francis Robert West (1749-1809). After leaving the Academy he practiced as a portrait painter in oil and pastel, taking his sitters from Dublin society. In 1788, on the advice of the American portrait painter Gilbert Stuart, Shee travelled to London where, despite useful introductions, he was reduced to making engraved copies for Thomas Macklin, the publisher."
4574,"SHUBIN, Fedot Ivanovich","(b. 1740, Techkovskaya, d. 1805, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/shubin/biograph.html,"
Russian sculptor. He came from peasant stock and in his youth he produced bone carvings. In 1759 he went to St Petersburg, first serving as a stoker at the Tsar's court, and then (1761-67) studying at the Academy of Arts, where he worked under Nicolas-François Gillet. Between 1767 and 1773 he worked in Paris and Rome on a grant from the Academy of Arts, also visiting London. During these years he produced a portrait bust of the Empress Catherine II (marble, 1771; London, Victoria and Albert Museum); and on his return to St Petersburg in 1773 he continued with such work, creating a portrait gallery of contemporary men and women, usually from aristocratic circles. Examples include the portrait busts of Pyotr Aleksandrovich Rumyantsev-Zadunaysky (marble, 1778), Grigory Aleksandrovich Potyomkin, Count of Tauris (1791), Aleksandr Andreyevich Bezborodko (1799) and the Tsar Paul I (1800; marble or bronze, St Petersburg, Russian Museum)."
4575,"SIBERECHTS, Jan","(b. 1627, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1703, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/siberech/biograph.html,"
Flemish landscape painter who settled in England in the early 1670s. His landscapes are somewhat Rubensian, but he is best known for his ""portraits"" of English country houses, done in a simple, rather archaic manner; two views of Longleat, Wiltshire (1675 and 1676), are still preserved in the house. He was the first professional exponent of the genre.



"
4576,"SIBILLA, Gijsbert Jansz.","(b. 1598, Weesp, d. 1655, Weesp)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sibilla/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the burgomaster of Weesp. He was a Dutch Reformed Protestant, but this did not prevent him from painting an Entombment for the Catholic church in Weesp. He painted church interiors but did not specialise in this genre, several portraits and various biblical scenes by him, dating between 1635 and 1654, are known. However, the combination of a church interior, group portrait, and genre scene is unique in his oeuvre.

Italian painter. He was born in the medieval hill-town of Sermoneta, south of Rome, and his career and fortunes were shaped by the life-long patronage he received from the Lords of Sermoneta, the Caetani Family."
4578,"SICKERT, Walter Richard","(b. 1860, München, d. 1942, Bathampton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sickert/biograph.html,"
English painter, printmaker, teacher and writer of German birth. Sickert was one of the most influential British artists of this century. He is often called a painter's painter, appealing primarily to artists working in the figurative tradition; there are few British figurative painters of the 20th century whose development can be adequately discussed without reference to Sickert's subject-matter or innovative techniques. He had a direct influence on the Camden Town Group and the Euston Road School, while his effect on Frank Auerbach, Howard Hodgkin and Francis Bacon was less tangible."

Spanish sculptor. After staying in Valladolid, he settled in Medina de Rioseco. Among his four sculptor sons who dedicated themselves to polychromy or assembly of altarpieces, Pedro de Sierra (1702-before 1760) was a notable artist in the Spanish Rococo.



"
4580,"SIGNAC, Paul","(b. 1863, Paris, d. 1935, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/signac/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker and writer. He came from a well-to-do family of shopkeepers. A visit to the exhibition of Claude Monet's works organized by Georges Charpentier at the offices of La Vie moderne in 1880 decided him on an artistic career and encouraged him to try painting out of doors."
4581,"SIGNORELLI, Luca","(b. ca. 1450, Cortona, d. 1523, Cortona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/signorel/biograph.html,"Italian painter from Cortona, active in various cities of central Italy, notably Arezzo, Florence, Orvieto, Perugia, and Rome. According to Vasari, Signorelli was a pupil of Piero della Francesca and this seems highly probable on stylistic grounds, for his solid figures and sensitive handling of light echo the work of the master. Signorelli differed from Piero, however, in his interest in the representation of action, which put him in line with contemporary Florentine artists such as the Pollaiuolo brothers. The Scourging of Christ (c. 1480), a signed processional banner for the church of Santa Maria del Mercato at Fabriano, reveals his developed handling of anatomy. Between 1477 and 1482 he decorated the Sacristy of St John in the Santuario della Santa Casa (Sanctuary of the Holy House) at Loreto.

"
4582,"SIGNORELLI, Francesco","(b. ca. 1495, Cortona, d. 1553, Cortona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/signorex/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, Luca Signorelli's nephew and artistic heir, Francesco Signorelli, who was active in his native Cortona and Umbria. He was the pupil of Luca, he collaborated with him, and he executed works in his uncle's late style in the decades following Luca's death in 1523.



"
4583,"SIGNORINI, Telemaco","(b. 1835, Firenze, d. 1901, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/signorin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, writer, critic, illustrator, etcher and teacher. He was a major figure of the Macchiaioli group, painting primarily landscapes, seascapes and street scenes in towns and villages in Tuscany and Liguria. As with many of the Macchiaioli, he did not always date his paintings, and their chronology must be deduced from exhibition catalogues and other contemporary sources. As a writer and critic he was the most ardent spokesman for, and promoter of, the Macchiaioli and wrote with insight and cutting wit about the art world of the second half of the 19th century.



"
4584,"SILO, Adam","(b. ca. 1674, Amsterdam, d. 1772, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silo/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, etcher, mezzotint engraver, draughtsman, instrument maker, modeller, goldsmith, shipbuilder and writer. Silo worked as a master shipbuilder and sea captain until he was 30, but by c. 1694 or shortly after he had learnt how to paint from Theodor van Pee (c. 1668-1746)."
4585,"SILOÉ, Diego de",(c. 1495-1563),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/siloe/diego/biograph.html,"
Diego de Siloé, Spanish architect and sculptor, was one of the leading figures in the transition from Gothic to Renaissance in Spanish art. He was the son and pupil of Gil de Siloé, a sculptor of uncertain origin (both Orleans and Antwerp are suggested as his native cilty). Diego formed his style in Italy where he collaborated with Bartolomé Ordoñez. By 1519 he returned to Burgos where he carried out several important commissions in the cathedral. It was as an architect rather than as a sculptor that he emerged as one of the great figures of Spanish arts. His masterpiece is Granada Cathedral, where he took over as architect in 1528.



"
4586,"SILOÉ, Gil de","(d. ca. 1501, Burgos)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/siloe/gil/biograph.html,"
Sculptor of uncertain origins (contemporary references suggest both Orleans and Antwerp as his native city). He settled in Burgos and is regarded as the outstanding Spanish sculptor of the 15th century and the last great exponent of the Gothic tradition. Gil's extant work includes two royal tombs (1489-93) in the monastery of Miraflores, Burgos: the first of John II of Castile and his wife Isabel of Portugal, the second of their son Prince Alfonso."
4587,"SILVANI, Gherardo","(b. 1579, Firenze, d. 1675, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silvani/gherardo/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, part of a family of artists, father of Pier Francesco Silvani. He was active mainly in Florence and other sites in Tuscany."
4588,"SILVANI, Pier Francesco","(b. 1620, Firenze, d. 1685, Pisa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silvani/pier/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and designer, active in Florence and other sites in Tuscany. He was part of a family of artists of Sienese origin. Following the confiscation of goods decreed in 1536 by Cosimo (later Cosimo I, Duke of Florence and Grand Duke of Tuscany), Francesco Silvani was obliged to pursue a modest commercial career. He had three sons, Silvano Silvani, Salvatore Silvani and Gherardo Silvani. At the beginning of the 17th century the Silvani were considered one of the rising Florentine families, due in particular to the professional success of Gherardo, whose own son, Pier Francesco Silvani, carried on the successful career of his father."
4589,"SILVESTRE, Israël","(b. 1621, Nancy, d. 1691, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silvest/israel/biograph.html,"
French engraver and draughtsman, member of a family of artists. About 1634 or 1635 he arrived in Paris, where his uncle Israël Henriet taught him to draw and engrave and published his prints. Between 1638 and 1641 Silvestre travelled in Italy; records show that he was there again c. 1643 and in 1653. After the second visit, his Vues d'Italie (Faucheux, no. 10) appeared, followed by Vues de Paris et des environs (1645; F 50); Ports de mer (1648; F 15 and 1650-51); Paysages (1654); a second set of Vues d'Italie and prints of the Ballet Royal's Noces de Tétis (1655; F 207); and Vues de châteaux (F 62) dedicated (1658) to Louis XIV."
4590,"SILVESTRE, Louis de","(b. 1675, Sceaux, d. 1760, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silvest/louis/biograph.html,"
French painter, the son of Israël Silvestre. He was first apprenticed to his father, going on to study under Charles Le Brun and then Bon Boullogne. In 1694 he competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome but left nevertheless for Italy. In Rome he met Carlo Maratti; he also visited Venice and Piedmont."
4591,SILVESTRO DELL'AQUILA,(active 1471-1504 in Central Italy),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/silvestr/biograph.html,"

Italian sculptor and painter. He was probably the son of the goldsmith Giacomo di Paolo Sulmona, recorded as resident in L'Aquila by 1467. Silvestro is first documented in 1471, sharing a workshop with Giovanni Biascuccio, and again at the end of the decade in partnership with the Florentine Francesco Trugi. The earliest documented work by the sculptor is a tabernacle with St James (untraced) commissioned by the ecclesiastical authorities of Tornimparte on 12 February 1476. In 1476 he was also commissioned to execute, in L'Aquila Cathedral, a funerary monument (damaged 1703) to Amico Agnifili, Bishop of L'Aquila (reg. 1431-76). A contract for materials dated 15 September 1476 allows a partial reconstruction of the original form of the marble monument. The surviving sepulchre with an effigy of Agnifili was flanked by niche figures (untraced) of St George and St Maximian. The lunette sculpture specified in the document can perhaps be identified with a relief of the Virgin and Child (L'Aquila, S Marciana). Agnifili's tomb was close in type to Florentine models such as Desiderio da Settignano's tomb of Carlo Marsuppini (Florence, Santa Croce). The familiarity with contemporary Florentine sculpture suggests a period of residence in Tuscany, and Silvestro may have been in Florence in the late 1460s or early 1470s.



"
4592,SIMON VON TAISTEN,"(b. ca. 1455, Taisten, d. ca. 1530)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simon/biograph.html,"
Tyrolean painter (Simone da Tesido in Italy), active in the province of Welsberg-Taisten in the southern Tyrol. He was influenced by his Tyrolean contemporaries Michael and Friedrich Pacher. By 1484 he was the head of a flourishing and highly active workshop, capable of executing large scale altarpieces and fresco cycles. One such fresco cycle, and perhaps his most ambitious, is that depicting scenes from the life of Saint Christopher, and the Crucifixion in the Church of St. Nicholas in Obertilliach.



"
4593,SIMÓN DE COLONIA,(c. 1445-c. 1511),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simon_c/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect and sculptor, son of architect Juan de Colonia and father of architect and sculptor Francisco de Colonia (c. 1470-1542)."
4594,SIMONE MARTINI,"(b. 1280/85, Siena, d. 1344, Avignon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simone/biograph.html,"
Sienese painter, the pupil of Duccio, who developed the use of outline for the sake of linear rhythm as well as the sophisticated colour harmonies implicit in Duccio. He was also deeply influenced by the sculpture of Giovanni Pisano, and even more by French Gothic art."
4595,"SIMONE CAMALDOLESE, Don",(active 1378–1405 in Florence),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simone_c/biograph.html,"
Italian illuminator. He was a Camaldolese monk of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence, the scriptorium of which was an important centre of manuscript production. Documented there between 1378 and 1389, he was a slightly younger contemporary of Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci, and he was probably the teacher of Lorenzo Monaco. His signature Simon de Senis in an Antiphonary completed in 1381 (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana) indicates that he was from Siena, although his work shows both Florentine and Sienese stylistic traits. His sweet, lyrical colour range of pale straw-yellows and lively turquoise shades shows knowledge of such Sienese artists as Lippo Vanni, while the ponderous forms are typical of the prevalent style practiced by such artists as Andrea and Jacopo di Cione Orcagna and Giovanni del Biondo in mid-14th-century Florence.



"
4596,SIMONE DEI CROCEFISSI,"(b. ca. 1330, d. 1399, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simone_d/biograph.html,"
Simone dei Crocefissi (also known as Simone di Filippo) was an Italian painter, active in Bologna. He belonged to the school of Vitale da Bologna. In the later fourteenth century several painters left Bologna for other centres and were more or less absorbed into the patterns of their adopted territories. Simone dei Crocefissi is the most important and prolific of the panel painters who maintained the Bolognese tradition in Bologna, and the clear colours of his fundamentally calm art link him closely to the miniaturists, the predominant artists among the painters in Bologna."
4597,"SIMONINI, Francesco","(b. 1686, Parma, d. ca. 1755, Venezia, or Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simonini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His date of birth is recorded in the register of the baptistery at Parma (no. 246), so correcting that (1689) given in all the earliest sources. He trained under Francesco Monti (1646-1712) and Pier Ilario Spolverini (1657-1734) in his home town and became a successful painter of battle scenes. It is probable that the young painter soon moved to Florence, where he studied the paintings of Jacques Courtois and copied 24 of his battle scenes. Later it is said that Simonini visited Rome. He certainly worked in Bologna, where he was documented as the 'painter of the most eminent Cardinal Ruffo, Papal ambassador in Bologna', a post the Cardinal held from August 1721 to August 1727."
4598,"SIMONIS, Eugène","(b. 1810, Liège, d. 1882, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/simonis/biograph.html,"
Belgian sculptor. He started his career at the Liège École de Dessin between 1825 and about 1826, when he was taught by François-Joseph Dewandre (1758-1835). Receiving a grant to continue his studies, he went to live in Rome (1828-35), where he was a pupil of Mathieu Kessels and Carlo Finelli. The influence of their mildly Neo-classical style is evident in his early works. After his return to Brussels he exhibited Innocence, depicting a young girl playing with a viper (marble, 1839; Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels)."
4599,"SINGLETON, Henry","(b. 1766, London, d. 1839, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/singleto/biograph.html,"
English painter and illustrator. His father died when he was young, and he was brought up by his uncle, the miniature painter William Singleton (d 1793). In 1782 he entered the Royal Academy Schools in London and in 1784 won a silver medal for a drawing from life, exhibiting at the Royal Academy for the first time the same year. He showed considerable promise and in 1788 won a gold medal for a painting inspired by John Dryden's ode Alexander's Feast that was especially praised by Reynolds. In 1793 Singleton was commissioned by the Royal Academy to paint the group portrait the Royal Academicians Assembled in their Council Chamber (London, Royal Academy). He soon became noted for his paintings inspired by the Bible and from literary sources, among them Manto and Tiresias (London, Tate Gallery) from John Dryden's Oedipus, and for his depictions of contemporary historical events, of which the watercolour Design Commemorative of the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1807; London, British Museum) is an example."
4600,"SIRANI, Elisabetta","(b. 1638, Bologna, d. 1665, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sirani/elisabet/biograph.html,"
Italian woman painter, daughter of Giovanni Andrea Sirani, who had been the principal assistant of Guido Reni. Her talent was encouraged by the writer Malvasia, who later wrote an adulatory biography of her in his 'Felsina Pittrice' (1678)."
4601,"SIRANI, Giovanni Andrea","(b. 1610, Bologna, d. 1670, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sirani/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher, who served a brief initial apprenticeship with Giacomo Cavedone before entering the school of Guido Reni, whose most devoted pupil and assistant he became. His work closely follows the late works of Reni; through whom he received much prestige. His paintings can be found in the local churches: the Presentation at the Temple in the Oratorio dei Preti, the Virgin in the Church of San Giorgio, the Crucifixion in the church of San Benedetto, the Last Supper in the Church of San Girolamo della Certosa."
4602,"SISLEY, Alfred","(b. 1839, Paris, d. 1899, Moret-sur-Loing)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sisley/biograph.html,"
French/British impressionist landscape painter, born in Paris to English parents. He studied under Corot, Gleyre, and Courbet and was (1873) a founding member of the Impressionist group. After 1871, Sisley lived modestly at Moret-sur-Loing and painted subtly shimmering small-town landscapes that reveal a wistful, lyrical sensibility. Influenced by his friends Renoir and Monet in his selection of colours, Sisley was less daring than Monet in his use of the ""rainbow palette"" and closer to the Barbizon School tradition."
4603,"SITTOW, Michel","(b. ca. 1468, Reval, d. 1525, Reval)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sittow/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter of Estonian birth. His career is well documented, though only a few securely attributed paintings survive. His work as a painter of portraits and small devotional works for princely patrons represents an international and courtly extension of the early Netherlandish school.

"
4604,"SKARBINA, Franz","(b. 1849, Berlin, d. 1910, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/skarbina/biograph.html,"

Danish painter, part of a family of painters. He was a landscape painter who continued the tradition of his short-lived friends Købke and Lundbye, becoming Denmark's leading landscapist in the 1850s and 1860s. He was a realist, and his paintings are characterized by cool clarity and architectural composition."
4606,"SKOVGAARD, Joakim","(b. 1856, København, d. 1933, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/skovgaar/son/biograph.html,"
Danish painter, part of a family of painters, son of Peter Christian Skovgaard. He was trained in drawing and painting by his father in the Danish Golden Age tradition. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1871 to 1876 and attended Léon Bonnat's school in Paris in the winter of 1880-81 where he was influenced by the trend towards Realism. In the 1880s, he travelled to Italy and to Greece, where he was accompanied by Kristian Zahrtmann, developing an interest in Symbolism. In Rome, he was influenced by the Impressionist approach to painting taken by Theodor Philipsen."
4607,"SLAUGHTER, Stephen","(b. 1697, London, d. 1765, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slaughte/biograph.html,"
English painter. In 1712 he joined Sir Godfrey Kneller's Academy, London, where he studied alongside Bartholomew Dandridge and Marcellus Laroon (1679-1772). He may also have attended the St Martin's Lane Academy in 1720. He was abroad in Flanders and Paris in the 1720s and 1730s, returning to London probably in 1733."
4608,"SLAVÍÈEK, Antonín","(b. 1870, Praha, d. 1910, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slavicek/biograph.html,"
Czech landscape painter, a founder of the Modern School of Czech painting, noted for his expressive landscapes and city scenes. Slavíček was born in Prague and from 1887 to 1889, and again 1894-1899, studied at the Academy of Graphic Arts under Julius Mařák (1832-1899), who considered him his most gifted pupil. He inherited his teacher's studio after Mařák's death in 1899, but soon closed shop to pursue his own creative paths. He was a member of the Mánes Union of Artists and took part in their exhibitions from 1898. He later developed a style derived from Impressionism."
4609,"SLAVONA, Maria","(b. 1865, Lübeck, d. 1931, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slavona/biograph.html,"
Maria Slavona (pseudonym of Maria Schorer), German Impressionist painter. She attended the women's art schools of Munich and Berlin. She was a student of Käthe Kollwitz (1867-1945). "

Polish painter. He was born into the gentry and administered his estate in Poland before travelling to Paris in 1888. Once there he studied at the Académie Colarossi where he met Gauguin. The impression this encounter made on him and Gauguin's encouragement prompted Ślewiński to dedicate himself to art. He submitted to Gauguin's artistic and personal influence, spending time with him in Paris and, from 1889, in Pont-Aven and Le Pouldu in Brittany. Seascapes painted during this period include Cliffs in Brittany (Upper Silesian Museum, Bytom). In 1891 Gauguin painted a portrait of Ślewiński (National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo) and presented it to him."
4612,"SLINGELANDT, Pieter Cornelisz. van","(b. 1640, Leiden, d. 1691, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slingela/biograph.html,"
It was during the 1660s, the decade immediately following his tenure in Dou's studio - he presumably studied with the master during the late 1650s - that van Slingeland produced his best work. Like Dou, and undoubtedly inspired by him (and by the impetus of the art market), van Slingelandt painted numerous images of domestic virtue which feature meticulously painted interiors filled with a profusion of household motifs. Van Slingelandt's use of chiaroscuro and the general disposition of space are analogous as well."
4613,"SLODTZ, Paul-Ambroise","(b. 1702, Paris, d. 1758, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slodtz/paul_amb/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, son of Sébastien Slodtz (1655-1726). He frequently collaborated with his elder brother Sébastien-Antoine (1694-1754), whom he succeeded in the office of Dessinateur de la Chambre et du Cabinet du Roi in 1754. In 1743 he was received as a member of the Académie Royale with a marble statue of the Fall of Icarus (Louvre, Paris), a work of considerable distinction in conception and execution. However, his work, apart from that on which he collaborated with Sébastien-Antoine, is not extensive. It included a marble statue of Joan of Arc as Pallas Athena (1753-5; destroyed), made for the city of Rouen, where he was a member of the Académie. His charming bas-relief Angels in the graceful Communion Chapel at Saint-Merry, Paris are effective and completely uniform in style - although separated in execution by more than a decade. In the porch at Saint-Sulpice the bas-reliefs are more serious and less purely charming."
4614,"SLODTZ, René-Michel","(b. 1705, Paris, d. 1764, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/slodtz/rene_mic/biograph.html,"
French sculptor (also called Michel-Ange Slodtz), member of a family of sculptors, designers, and decorators. He was the son of Sébastien Slodtz (1655-1726), who was Flemish by birth. In 1724 and 1726 he won second place in the Prix de Rome competitions but nevertheless was sent to study at the Académie de France in Rome in 1728; he soon attracted the attention of the director Nicolas Vleughels, of whom he carved a lively bust (marble, 1736, Jacquemart-André, Paris) and whose tomb he later made (marble, after 1737, S Luigi dei Francesi, Rome). One of his tasks as a student was to carve a marble copy (1731-36) of Michelangelo's Christ in S Maria sopra Minerva, which earned him his nickname. He stayed at the Académie until 1736, considerably longer than was usual, but eventually set up his own studio in Rome, and he quickly became one of the most important sculptors in the city. He was in Rome from 1728 to 1747."
4615,"SLUTER, Claus","(b. ca. 1350, Haarlem, d. 1406, Dijon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sluter/biograph.html,"
Influential master of early Netherlandish sculpture, who moved beyond the dominant French taste of the time and into highly individual monumental, naturalistic forms. The works of Claus Sluter infuse realism with spirituality and monumental grandeur. His influence was extensive among both painters and sculptors of 15th-century northern Europe."

Italian architect, active in Venice, also known as Il Fracà. He was the proto (main architect) in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, and in that capacity he provided design for the altar of the Chapel of SS Sacramento in the church. He is responsible for the construction of the façade of the church San Pietro in Castello, the high altar of the church Santa Maria Formosa and the restoration of the Palazzo Corfù on the Grand Canal.

4618,"SMEYERS, Egide","(b. 1634, Mechelen, d. 1710, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/smeyers/biograph.html,"
Egide (Egidius, Gillis) Smeyers was a Flemish painter. He belonged to a family in Mechelen which counted many artists among them. He studied under his father Nicholas, later under Jan Verhoeven. In friendship for his companion and master Lucas Franchoys the Younger he finished many of the latter's incomplete works after his death. Many of Smeyers's works are at the Sint-Janskerk in Mechelen."
4619,"SMIRKE, Robert the Younger","(b. 1781, Wigton, d. 1867, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/smirke/biograph.html,"
English architect, born into a family of artists. He studied the Neoclassical style with Sir John Soane. In 1796, he entered the Royal Academy of London and traveled across Europe for several years before establishing his architectural career in London. Some of his major commissions include the Royal Mint in London, moved from the Tower of London to its new location in 1809, and the central façade of the British Museum from 1823 to 1831."
4620,"SMIT, Aernout","(b. ca. 1641, Amsterdam, d. 1710, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/smit/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the pupil of Jan Theunisz. Blanckerhoff (1628-1669). His early works are characterized by light grey tonalities and a very good perspective. Later he became strongly influenced by Ludolf Backhuysen, the most important Dutch marine painter of the later part of the 17th century. Under his influence his marine paintings became more colourful. The majority of his marine paintings was executed between 1667 and 1678."
4621,"SMITH, George","(b. ca. 1714, Chicester, d. 1776, Chichester)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/smith/biograph.html,"
English painter, one of three brothers who were all artists in their native town of Chichester in the mid-18th century, and amongst the first native practitioners of the pure landscape. Their style derives ultimately from the exemplars of Claude Lorraine, but with a curiously English air. They enjoyed a great popularity during the third quarter of the 18th century. Of the three, George was the most prolific and successful, and exhibited frequently at the annual exhibitions of the Society of Artists from 1760 until two years before his death, in Chichester."
4622,"SMYTHSON, Robert","(b. ca. 1534, Crosby Ravensworth, d. 1614, Wollaton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/smythson/biograph.html,"
English architect, mason by training. Little is known about his birth and upbringing - his first mention in historical records comes in 1556, when he was stonemason for the house at Longleat, built by Sir John Thynne. He later designed Hardwick Hall, Wollaton Hall, Burton Agnes Hall, and other significant projects. Historically, a number of other Elizabethan houses, such as Gawthorpe Hall have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds."
4623,"SNAYERS, Pieter","(b. 1592, Antwerpen, d. 1667, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/snayers/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The son of a city messenger for Antwerp, he was an apprentice of Sebastiaen Vrancx, although he is not listed as such in the records of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He became a master of the Guild in 1612-13. The paintings of his early Antwerp period adopt the style and subject-matter of his master: scenes of skirmishes and robberies on country roads, represented as lively and colourful events. Snayers married a niece of the painter Cornelis Schut on 25 September 1618 and continued to live in Antwerp until the second half of the 1620s. Until 1625-26 he regularly paid his dues to the Guild. Shortly afterwards he moved to Brussels."
4624,"SNELLINCK, Jan I","(b. ca. 1544, Mechelen, d. 1638, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/snellinc/biograph.html,"
Flemish draughtsman, painter, tapestry designer and art dealer. He was a blood relation of the Brueghel family (through his mother, Corneila Verhulst), and his two marriages connected him with other artists of Antwerp. In 1574 he married Helena de Jode, daughter of the engraver and publisher Gerard de Jode (1509/17-1591). Snellinck worked for his father-in-law producing designs for prints. In 1586 Snellinck was married again to Paulina Cuypers, who was a relative of Van Dyck's mother, Maria."

4627,"SOANE, Sir John","(b. 1753, Goring, d. 1837, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/soane/biograph.html,"
English architect and collector, notable for his original, highly personal interpretations of the Neoclassical style. He is considered one of the most inventive European architects of his time."
4628,"SODOMA, Il","(b. 1477, Vercelli, d. 1549, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sodoma/biograph.html,"
Il Sodoma (originally Giovanni Antonio Bazzi), Italian painter, whose work bridges the High Renaissance and Mannerist styles. He was active chiefly in and around Siena, where he settled in 1501. Vasari, who disliked him, explains the origin of his nickname  - 'the sodomite' - in this fashion: 'His manner of life was licentious and dishonourable, and as he always boys and beardless youths about him of whom he was inordinately fond, this earned him the nickname of Sodoma; but instead of feeling shame, he gloried in it, writing stanzas and verses on it, singing them to the accompaniment of the lute.' (Sodoma, who was married and had children) himself used the name in his signature, and Vasari's story has been questioned. Vasari also tells us that Sodoma kept a menagerie of strange animals 'so that his home resembled a veritable Noah's ark.'

"
4629,"SØDRING, Frederik Hansen","(b. 1809, Aalborg, d. 1862, Hellerup)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sodring/biograph.html,"
Danish landscape painter. He spent some time living in Norway with his parents before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen beginning in 1825. There he initially studied under Jens Peter Møller (1783-1854), but his greatest influence was from Johan Christian Dahl. For his debut at Charlottenborg in 1828 Sødring presented two copies after Dahl, and in the years that followed the Norwegian painter's views on art and artistic principles came to be of crucial importance to Sødring's own work."
4630,"SOEST, Gerard","(b. ca. 1600, d. 1681, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/soest/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in England. He is traditionally stated to have come from Soest in Westphalia but was almost certainly Dutch by birth and training. He probably came to England in the late 1640s, and his earliest works show some influence from William Dobson. His earliest dated work was painted in 1646. Although he had a respectable practice he never established himself in the most fashionable circles in London and was never employed at the court."
4631,"SOGLIANI, Giovanni Antonio","(b. 1492, Firenze, d. 1544, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sogliani/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained with Lorenzo di Credi, to whom he remained closely attached; he is recorded as an executor of Lorenzo's will in 1531. After collaborating on works in the style of Lorenzo, from 1515 he had an independent shop and began to develop his own style. In the St Martin for Orsanmichele in Florence, for example, he complemented his master's manner with a sfumato reflecting contemporary Florentine painting. The attribution of another work of this period, the Last Supper in the convent of S Maria di Candeli, Florence, has been disputed, but it is certainly characteristic of Sogliani. The remarkable altarpiece of the Martyrdom of St Acazio (Florence, S Lorenzo) of 1521 reflects the work of Andrea del Sarto. Vasari recorded that Sogliani was a follower of Fra Bartolommeo, and this is confirmed by the style of the monumental figures in such works as St Bridget Imposing the Rule (1522) and the Trinity with SS James, Mary Magdalene and Catherine (both Florence, Museo S Salvi), as well as the Allegory of the Immaculate Conception (Florence, Accademia) and the altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with SS Jerome and Anselm for S Maria at Ripa, near Empoli."

4633,"SOHLBERG, Harald","(b. 1877, Christiania, d. 1935, Oslo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sohlberg/biograph.html,"
Norwegian painter and printmaker. Sohlberg decided to be a painter when young, but his father wished him to follow a thorough training as a craftsman. Sohlberg therefore enrolled at the Royal School of Drawing in Kristiania (Christiania until 1877, now Oslo) in 1885 under the interior designer Wilhelm Krogh (1829-1913) and stayed at the school until 1890. Subsequently, he attended night classes under the graphic artist and painter Johan Nordhagen (1856-1956) both in the autumn of 1906 and also from 1911 to 1917, when he concentrated on printmaking."

Russian painter. He studied at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg from 1800 to 1810 and continued to live there until 1846, when he moved to Moscow. He was the first Russian master to paint portraits only in watercolours (without the use of bodycolour), a technique that supplanted the miniature portrait during the period 1820-50."
4635,"SOLA, Antonio","(b. 1787, Barcelona, d. 1861, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sola/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He was the most important Spanish sculptor working in the Neoclassical style, though his work eventually took him to Italy. He began his studies at the Academia de La Lonja in Barcelona. He received a grant from the Junta de Comercio there to continue his studies in Rome, and from there he sent back work to the Junta including his study for the Dying Gladiator (untraced). During the Napoleonic period Sola was imprisoned in Rome for refusing to recognize Joseph Bonaparte as Spain's monarch. After the Peninsular War he received a grant in compensation of 3000 reales from Ferdinand VII (restored to the throne in 1814)."

Italian sculptor and architect, called Il Gobbo (the hunchback), part of a family of asrtists, brother of Andrea Solario. He received his early training from his cousin, Pietro Antonio Solari, to whom he was apprenticed for five years from 1483. Cristoforo worked in Venice in the early 1490s, but by 1493 he was back in Milan, where he was briefly employed by Ludovico Sforza. In 1494 he returned to Venice, probably with his brother Andrea Solario. Although Solari is known to have executed several works during this second Venetian period, none has been identified.

"
4638,"SOLARI, Guiniforte","(b. 1429, Milano, d. 1481, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/solari/guinifor/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, active in Milan, part of a family of artists. He completed the Ospedale Maggiore, Milan, designed by Filarete, in the Gothic style and was responsible for the Gothic nave of Santa Maria delle Grazie in the same city (1463-90) to which Bramante added a domed crossing and choir (from 1493). He also seems to have carried out works at the Duomo, Milan, and at the Certosa, Pavia.


"
4639,"SOLARI, Pietro Antonio","(b. ca. 1445, Carona, d. 1493, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/solari/pietro/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, part of a family of artists, son of Guiniforte Solari. From 1476 he worked with his father in the architectural workshop of Milan Cathedral, but after Guiniforte's death in 1481 he became master builder of all the buildings for which his father had been responsible (although he shared the responsibility with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo at the Certosa di Pavia, and at Milan Cathedral). Three churches in Milan, del Carmine, Santa Maria Incoronata and Santa Maria della Pace, are ascribed on stylistic grounds to Pietro Antonio (together with Guiniforte). The only authenticated sculpture is the tomb of Marco de' Capitani, Bishop of Alexandria (1484; Alessandria Cathedral), with a somewhat crudely executed recumbent effigy."
4640,"SOLARI, Santino","(b. 1576, Verna, d. 1646, Salzburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/solari_s/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and sculptor, active in Austria. In 1612, he was appointed chief architect of Salzburg by the archbishop Markus Sittikus. His work introduced north Italian early Baroque to Austria. His most important work is the Salzburg Cathedral, in which the frescoes were executed by his son Ignazio (active 1632-1650).



"
4641,"SOLARIO, Antonio",(active 1502-1514),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/solario/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is mentioned in a document dated 21 April 1502 at Fermo, as 'magister Antonius Joanis Pieri de Soleriis de Venetiis habitator Firmi', which suggests that he was from Venice and had lived in Fermo for some time. The document refers to the commission to complete a polyptych for San Giuseppe da Copertino (popularly known as San Francesco), Osimo, left unfinished at his death by Vittore Crivelli. This painting, identified as the polyptych in San Francesco, Monte San Pietrangeli, shows no sign of intervention by Solario, however. His altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with Saints, also for San Giuseppe in Osimo (in situ), is documented between 1503 and 1506. On the basis of its similar style, he has also been credited with the Virgin and Child with Sts Bernard, Catherine, Jerome and Lucy in Santa Maria del Carmine in Fermo."
4642,"SOLDANI BENZI, Massimiliano","(b. 1656, Firenze, d. 1740, Montevarchi)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/soldani/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, medalist. Born to an aristocratic cavalry captain from Tuscany, he enjoyed Medici patronage. The finest bronze caster in Europe in the late 1600s, he was reported to have made sculptures as a child based on models from the della Robbia workshop. He entered the orbit of the Medicis at nineteen, when he attended their drawing school in Florence. Taken with his work, Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici sent Soldani Benzi to Rome to further his artistic education and in particular to learn coin-making. His study at the Florentine Academy in Rome under Ferrata brought him into contact with the circle of Queen Christina of Sweden and foreign artists such as his exact contemporary the Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723). During his four years in Rome, Soldani Benzi's medallion portraits attracted the attention of the abdicated Queen of Sweden, but Cosimo prohibited him from accepting her commissions."
4643,"SOLDI, Andrea","(b. ca. 1703, Firenze, d. 1771, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/soldi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in England. George Vertue, the only source for Soldi's earliest years, described him in 1738 as a Florentine aged 'about thirty-five or rather more' who had been in England 'about two years'. He had previously been in the Middle East, where he painted some British merchants of the Levant Company who had advised him to go to London. Two three-quarter-length portraits called Thomas Sheppard (1733 and 1735-36; private collections) belong to this period."

Giovanni Gioseffo first apprenticed with Domenico Maria Canuti, and then in 1672, he entered the Roman studio of Lorenzo Pasinelli. He painted frescoes in the cupola of Santa Maria dei Poveri in Bologna, and an altarpiece of the Trinity (1700) for the chiesa del Suffragio in Imola. He is said to have collaborated with Giuseppe Maria Crespi."

Italian architect and painter. He studied at the academy of Bologna and in Rome (1770-83) where he was influenced by Pompeo Batoni's classicism and painting. He returned to Modena in 1784 and directed the academy and taught architecture. He became a court architect in 1786 and worked on the completion of the Ducal Palace. His most important work is the new wing of the Procuratie Nuove on Piazza San Marco in Venice (begun 1810).

4646,"SOLIMENA, Francesco","(b. 1657, Nocera dei Pagani, d. 1743, Barra)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/solimena/biograph.html,"
Solimena was the leading Neapolitan painter of the first half of the 18th century. In a long and extremely productive career he painted frescoes in many of the great churches in Naples, and he became one of the wealthiest and most famous European artists of his day. His vigorous style, often marked by dramatic lighting, owed much to the example of such Baroque artists as Luca Giordano (his outstanding predecessor in Naples), Lanfranco, and Preti, but it also has a firmness of structure and a clarity of draughtmanship that shows his allegiance to the classical tradition of Raphael and Annibale Carracci. Solimena's paintings were in demand all over Europe, and his international influence was spread also by his celebrity as teacher. Ramsay was among his pupils and Fragonard copied his work in San Paolo Maggiore.

He was obliged to sell illustrations to periodicals to make a living, contributing, among others, to Charge, Cravache, L'Inutile, Chronique parisienne and Courier français. His drawings were spirited, but because their humour often relied on topicality his fame was short-lived."

The biographical information pertaining to Sormani remains incomplete, but it is suggested that he worked as an apprentice in his father's workshop in Carrara after spending his early childhood in Savona. Sormani worked in Rome from 1551 until his death, remaining there except for a brief return visit to Carrara in 1561-62, possibly concerning the death of his father."

In 1738 he returned to Lyon to practice as an architect. The simplicity, spaciousness, and archaeologically accurate classical details of the principal works of his Lyon period, the extension of the Hôtel-Dieu (begun 1741) and the Loge des Changes (1751-52), presaged the movement of French taste away from the Rococo and toward Neoclassicism."

He was the companion, and, according to contemporaries, the assistant of Caravaggio, and he underwent his influence. He continued his development alongside of Dentone and Brizio, while at the same time gravitating increasingly towards the Carracci Academy. There he fell under the influence of Lodovico Carracci, whose stylistic tendencies remained a constant in all of Spada's subsequent production.

4663,"SPADARINO, lo","(b. 1585, Roma, d. 1652, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spadarin/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born Giovanni Antonio Galli. He was the son of a swordsmith or frabbricante di spade, earning him the moniker, ""Spadarino"", or roughly ""Little Sword"". His family were from Florence, and he has previously been confused with his brother, Giacomo Galli, a picture-framer, painter and engraver about whom little is known.  He was recorded alongside Bartolomeo Manfredi, Jusepe de Ribera, Cecco del Caravaggio and Carlo Saraceni as one of the closest of Caravaggio's followers c. 1620."
4664,"SPADINO, Bartolomeo","(b. 1696, Roma, d. 1738, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spadino/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Bartolomeo Spadino (Bartolomeo Castelli the Younger), Italian painter, son of Giovanni Paolo Spadino. Little is known about his life. His compositions are more archaising than those of his father's, they are not so much inspired by the exuberant works of Abraham Brueghel and Christian Berentz - both of whom influenced his father - as they are by the more restrained paintings of Michelangelo Pace, called Michelangelo del Campidoglio.



"
4665,"SPADINO, Giovanni Paolo","(b. 1659, Roma, d. ca. 1730, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spadino/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also known as Giovanni Paolo Castelli, part of a family of painters. He was active in Rome painting still-life paintings of bowls of fruit and flowers. Over half a dozen works are collected in the Pinacoteca Civica Fortunato Duranti, Montefortino. His son, Bartolomeo Spadino, was also a painter.

4666,"SPAENDONCK, Cornelis van","(b. 1756, Tilburg, d. 1840, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spaendon/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, brother of Gerard van Spaendonck. After an apprenticeship with Guillaume-Jacques (Willem) Herreyns at Antwerp, he left for Paris in 1773 to join his brother, as pupil and collaborator. Between 1785 and 1800, Cornelis was director at the Sèvres porcelain factory, but his administrative skills did not equal his abilities as an artist and he lost this appointment, though he continued as a designer there until 1808. In 1789 he became a member of the Académie and made his Salon début, establishing himself in his own right, and, unlike Gerard, he painted and exhibited throughout his life; his contributions to the Salons continued until 1833. He concentrated on oil and gouache rather than watercolour and was a successful artist at the height of his career. At his death there were 29 paintings and several oil studies in his studio; these were auctioned in February 1840.



"
4667,"SPAENDONCK, Gerard van","(b. 1746, Tilburg, d. 1822, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spaendon/gerard/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and engraver, brother of Cornelis van Spaendonck. His father was the steward of the seignory of Tilburg, belonging to the Prince of Hesse-Kassel, and the Prince had one of the finest gardens in the area, designed in the latest French style; the garden surely influenced Gerard at a young age. When Gerard went to Paris in 1769, flower painting left its traditional centre in the Low Countries for the first time."
4668,"SPANZOTTI, Giovanni Martino","(b. ca. 1456, Casale Monferrato, d. ca. 1528, Chiavasso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spanzott/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in northern Italy. Little is known of his life. Born into a family of painters from Varese, he likely apprenticed with his father, Pietro. He appears to have had contacts with either Francesco del Cossa or his works. Other influences are Zanetto Bugatto (1433-1476), and Vincenzo Foppa."
4669,"SPAVENTO, Giorgio","(b. ca. 1440, Venezia, d. 1509, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spavento/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and engineer, active in Venice. Projects he was associated with include repairs to the campanile of San Marco (1489); the new east wing of the Doge's Palace (1496); the restoration of the Palazzo della Ragione in Vicenza; repairs to the old, wooden Rialto Bridge in Venice and the Ponte delle Navi in Verona (1502); the Lidi (coastal defences) of Venice; the church of San Niccolò di Castello (consecrated 1503, demolished c. 1810); the rebuilding of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi; and the church of San Salvator. The last two projects are considered his most important surviving works although they were largely executed by others."
4670,"SPECCHI, Alessandro","(b. 1668, Roma, d. 1729, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/specchi/biograph.html,"
Italian architect and printmaker. He trained as an architect under Carlo Fontana. He also specialized as an engraver and made a well known series of plates for prints of vedute or views of Rome."
4671,"SPECKAERT, Hans","(b. ca. 1540, Bruxelles, d. 1577, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/speeckae/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, one of several Northern Mannerist painters working in Rome in the sixteenth century. He belonged to a group of artists including Bartholomew Spranger, Karel van Mander and the sculptor Hans Mont of Ghent, who spent varying lengths of time in Rome studying the art of classical antiquity and the work of great Renaissance masters like Raphael and Michelangelo. He was a friend of the engraver Cornelis Cort, who was famed for his faithful reproductive prints. Speckaert painted Cort's portrait and was made his heir. They worked together on an engraving after Raphael's fresco of The Victory of Constantine over Maxentius. The engraving was still unfinished on Cort's death."
4672,"SPEECKAERT, Michel Joseph","(b. 1748, Leuven, d. 1838, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/speeckaf/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He studied painting at the Academy of Antwerp, but he worked the major part of his life in Brussels, except for the period 1824-1835 when he settled in Mechelen."
4673,"SPEETH, Peter","(b. 1772, Mannheim, d. 1831, Odessa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/speeth/biograph.html,"
German architect. He worked in Frankfurt from 1788-94 under Nicolas de Pigage (1723-1796), in Heidelberg from 1797, and from 1804 at Amorbach for the Prince of Leiningen. In 1807 he moved to Würzburg in the service of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, where he designed the Women's Penitentiary (1811), an early and striking Neo-Renaissance design, as well as the Zeller Torhaus guard house (1814) which resembles Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's barrières for Paris, and the Gerichtsdienerhaus (House of the Court Usher, 1811-13)."
4674,"SPELT, Adrian van der","(b. ca. 1630, Leiden, d. 1673, Gouda)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spelt/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He joined the Guild of St Luke in Leiden in 1658. Later, he became court painter to the Great Elector in Berlin. Then he returned to his native town of Gouda. He was specialized in flower still-lifes.


"
4675,SPERANDIO SAVELLI,"(b. ca. 1425, Mantova, d. ca. 1504, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sperandi/biograph.html,"
Sperandio di Bartolommeo Savelli, Italian medallist, architect, sculptor, painter, bronze and cannon caster. He was the son of a Roman goldsmith, Bartolommeo di Sperandio Savelli. In c. 1437 the family left Mantua to settle in Ferrara, where Sperandio was probably trained in goldsmithing by his father. Sperandio is first mentioned as a goldsmith at Ferrara in 1445 and again in 1447. He appears to have returned to Mantua at some point and to have been employed by Borso d'Este, Marquess of Ferrara, by the early 1460s. His medals of Giovanni II Bentivoglio, Prince of Bologna, Bartolommeo Pendaglia, merchant at Ferrara, Giustiniano Cavitelli, jurisconsult at Cremona, and Antonio Sarzanella de' Manfredi of Faenza have been assigned to the early years of his first period in Ferrara (1462-77). The medal depicting Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan (c. 1466), shows the sitter in three-quarter view (the only en face medallic work by Sperandio). It does not appear to have been executed from life, but from a painting or drawing."
4676,"SPIEGLER, Franz Joseph","(b. 1691, Wangen im Allgäu, d. 1756, Konstanz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spiegler/biograph.html,"
German painter. He is best known for his frescoes, which decorate many of the churches and monasteries along the Upper Swabian Baroque Route. The frescoes in the Zwiefalten Abbey are considered his masterpiece."
4677,"SPIERINCKX, Pieter","(b. 1635, Antwerpen, d. 1711, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spierinc/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and tapestry designer. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1655 and was active there until 1660. He went to Italy, Lyon and Paris where he worked for the French king Louis XIV for whom he painted landscapes. These landscapes were influenced by Salvator Rosa and Paul Bril. He was back in Antwerp in 1666."
4678,"SPIERING, François","(b. ca. 1549, Antwerpen, d. 1631, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spiering/biograph.html,"
François Spiering (also spelt Spierincx) was a Flemish weaver, active in Delft. He arrived in Delft 1591, became member of the Guild in 1613. In his successful tapestry workshop he produced figurative (pictorial) tapestries. He was visited in 1598 by the diarist Aernout van Buchell (1565?-1641) who in his diary raved about the pictorial quality and colour which was - he wrote - nearly as good as that of oil paints."
4679,"SPINAZZI, Innocenzo","(b. 1726, Roma, d. 1798, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spinazzi/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. Son of a silversmith, he became the leading sculptor in Enlightenment Florence. In the tradition of Gianlorenzo Bernini, he often supplemented his marble works with accoutrements in bronze and other materials. He was trained by Giovanni Battista Maini in Rome, where his works include a statue of St Joseph Calasanctius (1755) in St Peter's."
4680,"SPINELLI, Giovanni Battista",(active in Naples from ca. 1630; d. ca. 1660),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spinelli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. He painted altarpieces and history paintings, in a highly original style that united the ambiguous and refined sensuality of late Mannerism with the naturalistic light and more balanced compositions of 17th-century painters. His family settled in Chieti, and Spinelli was active in the Abruzzi and in Naples; his biography was written by Bernardo de Dominici, who records that he was a pupil of Massimo Stanzione, that he gave up painting for alchemy, and died in 1647 during an alchemical experiment. It seems, however, that Spinelli received his early training in the late 1620s in the workshop of a Bergamese painter, Domenico Carpinoni (1566-1658), who throughout his life was dedicated to the study of prints by artists from northern Europe."
4681,"SPINELLI, Parri","(b. 1387, Arezzo, d. ca. 1452, Arezzo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spinello/parri/biograph.html,"
Parri Spinelli [Guasparri di Spinello], Italian painter, draughtsman and goldsmith, part of the Spinelli family, son of Spinello Aretino. Although many of his frescoes are lost, an impressive number of drawings has survived. He is first recorded in Siena, once in 1405 as recipient of a payment made to his father for work in the cathedral, and again in 1407, when he was named as an assistant in Spinello Aretino's contract for the frescoes in the Sala dei Priori (Sala della Balia) in the Palazzo Pubblico. His idiosyncratic style and eccentric figures, which appear to be in a state of frenzied animation, bear little or no relation to Spinello's sober, more monumental approach, although both painters had the same delicacy of handling. However, he derived gothicizing elements from his father and developed them to an exaggerated degree."
4682,"SPINELLI, Niccolò di Forzore","(b. 1430, Firenze, d. 1514, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spinello/spinelln/biograph.html,"
Niccolò di Forzore di Niccolò di Luca Spinelli (Niccolò Fiorentino), Italian medalist, born in Florence (therefore his name 'the Florentine') on 23 April 1430 into a family of goldsmiths. His great-uncle was the painter Spinello Aretino. Part of his life and career can be traced by references in contemporary documents: his work as a seal-engraver for Charles the Bold, the duke of Burgundy, in 1468, his marriage to Alessandra di Lionardo di Lorenzo de' Paolo in 1471, his knowledge of Flanders mentioned by Leonardo da Vinci. He fathered at least six children. On 26 May 1484 Niccolò was paid to repair and re-cut the great silver seal of the Arte de' Giudici e Notai [Guild of Justices and Notaries] of Florence. He signed five portrait medals, of which two have been dated (1485 and 1492). More than 160 other pieces have been attributed to him, or his school or circle. Niccolò died before 23 April 1514 and was buried in Santa Maria Novella in Florence.

4683,SPINELLO ARETINO,"(b. ca. 1345, Arezzo, d. 1410, Arezzo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spinello/spinello/biograph.html,"

Spinello Aretino (Spinello di Luca Spinelli), Italian painter and draughtsman. He came from Arezzo (hence the name Aretino) and probably trained in Florence, perhaps under Agnolo Gaddi. He was the most prolific muralist of his time and undertook large fresco cycles all over Tuscany. His last series was the cycle devoted to the Sienese pope Alexander III in Siena Town Hall (1408-10). He also painted altarpieces. Spinello borrowed ideas freely from other painters, notably Giotto, but his style was sturdy and vigorous. Several fresco fragments by Spinello are in the National Gallery, London.

"
4684,"SPITZWEG, Carl","(b. 1808, München, d. 1885, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spitzweg/biograph.html,"
German painter and graphic artist, active in his native Munich. He began his career as a pharmacist, and turned fairly late to art, first as a newspaper caricaturist, then as a painter. Although he travelled widely (England, France, Italy, and elsewhere), he was provincial in his choice of subjects and is an outstanding representative of the Biedermeier style. His pictures are generally small, humorous in content, and full of lovingly depicted anecdotal detail {The Poor Poet, Neue Pinakothek, Munich, 1839, and other versions). He also painted excellent landscapes that show a debt to the Barbizon School.



"
4685,"SPRANGER, Bartholomaeus","(b. 1546, Antwerpen, d. 1611, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/spranger/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter from Antwerp who worked in Paris (c.1565) at the same time as Primaticcio and Niccolo dell' Abbate, and in Rome (c.1567-75) as an assistant to Taddeo Zuccaro, and in Vienna, for the Emperor Maximilian II, in 1575. He later worked for Rudolf II in Prague, where he died."
4686,"SQUARCIONE, Francesco","(b. 1397, Padova, d. 1468, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/squarcio/biograph.html,"Italian painter, active in Padua. He is an enigmatic figure, who is important in terms of the pupils he trained, rather than for his own work. A Paduan writer of 1560 patriotically described him as a famous and benevolent master, with many pupils (according to Vasari, he trained 137) and a large collection of antique sculpture gathered on youthful journeys through Greece and Italy. More recent research, however, gives a picture of a tailor who, turning painter in his middle thirties, was for many years discreditably involved in a series of lawsuits with pupils, who resentful of his exploitation of their talents, had broken their apprenticeships with him (Mantegna was the most famous litigants). No traces of his collection remain, but it is likely that something of the antiquarian erudition of the university town of Padua rubbed off on the young men who spent time in his workshop.

"

Flemish painter and etcher. After the fall of Antwerp (1585) his Protestant family emigrated to Middelburg, but Adriaen later returned to Antwerp. His first dated work is a Landscape with Hunters (1604; Private collection). In 1609 or 1610 he became a master; he trained three apprentices. In 1633-04 he spent ten months in England, where, among other work, he painted two views of Greenwich (e.g. View of Greenwich with King Charles I, Queen Henrietta Maria and the Court, Royal Collection, Windsor). As well as landscapes, he also painted religious, mythological and allegorical scenes and was an etcher."
4688,"STALBURCH, Jan van",(active 1555-1562 in Leuven),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stalburc/biograph.html,"

Austrian sculptor. He may have been the son of Johann Georg Stämel, and was a pupil of Johann Jakob Schoy (1686-1733). His principal work was produced in Admont in Austria. After an Italian sojourn from 1718 to 1725, Stammel remained in Admont until his death, working as collegiate sculptor. In addition to such structures as the high altar in St. Martin near Graz, which was constructed between 173 and 1740, he carried out a lot of work for the abbey of Admont, including the sculptural work for the ornate collegiate library in 1750s.

Giovanni Stanchi (called Giovanni Stanchi dei Fiori), was an Italian still-life painter in Rome, specialised in flower pieces. His younger brothers Niccolò (1611-1680) and Angelo (1626-1673) were also still-life painters who collaborated with Giovanni.



"
4691,"STANFIELD, Clarkson","(b. 1793, Sunderland, d. 1867, Hampstead)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stanfiel/biograph.html,"
English painter and scenographer. The son of Mary Hoad and James Field Stanfield, an Irish actor and author, he was apprenticed to a heraldic coach painter at the age of 12, but in 1808 he abandoned this and went to sea in a collier. In 1812 he was press-ganged and spent two years on HMS Namur, the guard-ship at Sheerness. After being discharged as the result of an injury in 1814, he joined the merchant navy, sailing to China in the Indiaman Warley in 1815. Soon after his return in 1816 he missed his ship and became a scene painter, first at the Royalty Theatre, Stepney, and then at the Royal Coburg, Lambeth. There he was later joined by David Roberts, who became a lifelong friend, and in 1822 both men were employed as scene painters at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane."

Polish painter and printmaker. He came from a Polish family that had settled in the Ukraine after having been deported to Russia as punishment for the patriotic activities of the artist's father Antoni Stanisławski, a lawyer, poet and translator. In 1879 Jan Stanisławski came to Warsaw and, after completing his higher studies in mathematics, started to study painting (probably in 1881) under Wojciech Gerson (1831-1901) at the Warsaw School of Drawing, continuing in 1883-84 under Władysław Łuszczkiewicz (1828-1900) at the School of Fine Arts in Kraków. Under Gerson's influence Stanisławski chose landscape as his main and almost only subject."
4693,"STANLEY, Carl Frederik","(b. 1738, Westminster, d. 1813, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stanley/biograph.html,"
English-born Danish sculptor, a leading proponent of early Neoclassicism in Denmark. He was the son of Simon Carl Stanley (1703-1761), a sculptor of English descent who had been born in Denmark but moved to England. In 1746 the family returned to Denmark.
 
After first training with his father, Carl Frederik Stanley became one of the first students to enter the new Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1755. In 1758 he won the Academy's large gold medal for the sculpture Noah's Sacrifice. The gold medal was accompanied by a six-year travel scholarship and the following year he went abroad to further his education. He first settled in Paris, where he studied under the sculptor Guillaume Coustou II. In 1762 he moved to Rome, where he studied and made copies of Classical sculptures, before returning to Denmark in 1766."
4694,"STANZIONE, Massimo","(b. 1585, Orta di Antilla, d. 1656, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stanzion/biograph.html,"One of the leading Neapolitan painters of the Caravaggio School. He was working in Rome by 1617 where he would have seen the Farnese Gallery by Annibale Carracci. His style is similar to that of Saraceni in that it is a more graceful and elegant form of Caravaggism than that practised by his fellow Neapolitan Ribera, although Ribera exerted some influence on him. Stanzione has been called the Neapolitan Guido Reni which aptly summarizes his semi-Bolognese classicism (e.g. his signed picture in San Francisco). He may have died in the great plague of 1656 in Naples. Most of his pictures are in Naples, but there are others in Dresden, Florence, Frankfurt, Kansas City, London, Manchester, New York and Sarasota Fla.

Russian architect and urban planner. He was one of the first graduates of the Moscow University College (1755-58) and of the Imperial Academy of Arts (1758-62). He continued his education in Paris (1762-67) and Rome (1767-68), becoming apprenticed to Charles de Wailly and other fashionable architects of his day. Back in Russia, he delivered lectures in the Academy of Arts, which nominated him academician (1769) and professor (1785). Starov held the post of the principal architect of St. Petersburg between 1772 and 1774. "
4697,"STARR, Sidney","(b. 1857, Kingston-upon-Hull, d. 1925, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/starr/biograph.html,"
English genre, portrait, landscape and decorative painter. He studied at the Slade School under Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) and Legros, winning a Slade Scholarship 1874. Starr spent the first half of his artistic career in Britain and Europe, before moving to New York. He became a member of the Society of British Artists (SBA) in 1886, in the year of Whistler's presidency. Whistler's plans to reform the Society, which received a Royal charter in 1887, were poorly received and he was forced to resign in 1888. He took a large group of followers with him, including Starr, Frances Bate, Frederick Brown, Francis James, Paul Maitland, Theodore Roussel, Philip Wilson Steer, George Thomson, Bernhard Sickert and Walter Sickert. This group, headed by Walter Sickert, took control of the New English Art Club from 1888. They exhibited as the 'London Impressionists' at the Goupil Galleries in December 1889 and in Sickert's Chelsea studio, receiving support from two new periodicals, the Whirlwind and Art Weekly."

Italian sculptor and restorer, also called Cristofano da Bracciano. He was a little-known sculptor who also worked on the restoration of marble works excavated from archaeological sites. He trained in Florence in the circle of Bartolomeo Ammanati and Giambologna. This provided a Mannerist environment in which Stati acquired a good command of his craft and a certain elegance of style."
4699,"STAZIO, Abbondio","(b. 1663, Massagno, d. 1757, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stazio/biograph.html,"
Italian stuccoist. After a period of training as a stuccoist in Rome, he worked mainly in Venice, where his first work was connected with the decoration of the halls of the Palazzo Albrizzi (1690-1710). This work shows the profusion of decorative and figurative elements treated in extremely plastic and vigorous late Baroque manner. An entirely different spirit is the decoration of the Palazzo Sagredo on the Grand Canal at S. Sofia, executed with the help of his pupil, Carpoforo Mazzetti, known as Tencalla (signed and dated 1718), where the stucco is lighter and minute. In design and workmanship, the ornate bedroom, consisting of an antechamber with a bed alcove, is one of the finest of its period. It is currently preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.



"
4700,"STEEN, Jan","(b. 1626, Leiden, d. 1679, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He is best known for his humorous genre scenes, warm hearted and animated works in which he treats life as a vast comedy of manners. In Holland he ranks next to Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Hals in popularity and a 'Jan Steen household' has become an epithet for an untidy house. But Steen, one of the most prolific Dutch artists, has many other faces. He painted portraits, historical, mythological, and religious subjects (he was a Catholic), and the animals, birds, and still-lifes in his pictures rival those by any specialist contemporaries. As a painter of children he was unsurpassed."
4701,"STEEN, Jan van der",(1635-1700),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steen_j/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, pupil of Artus Quellinus II. He designed an altar and a tribune in the Cathedral of Mechelen. The Church of the Beguinage in Mechelen contains by him the main altar and two white marble angels as part of a holy-water font.

Dutch painter. Harmen Steenwijck and his painter brother Pieter were the sons of a spectacle and lens maker who lived in Delft from 1590s to 1654. Both sons became pupils of their relative David Bailly who lived and worked in Leiden. Harmen studied there between 1628-1633. He moved from Leiden to Delft in 1628 and shared a studio with his brother. In 1654 he traveled to the East Indies, returning to Holland the following year. He worked in a luminous and illusionistic manner, resembling that of Bailly, Dou and Lievens.

Flemish painter. According to van Mander, he was a pupil of Hans Vredeman de Vries in Antwerp. In 1570 he followed his master to Aachen, where he stayed for several years, in 1573 marrying Helena, the daughter of Marten van Valckenborch, who had also left Antwerp for Aachen."
4706,"STEENWYCK, Hendrick van the Younger","(b. ca. 1580, Antwerpen, d. 1649, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steenwyc/hendric2/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, son of Hendrick van Steenwijk the Elder. He was trained by his father, and close stylistic similarities make it sometimes difficult to distinguish between their works. His earliest known painting represents St Jerome (1602; Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena). It is likely that he spent several years in Antwerp, although apparently he was not enrolled in the Guild of St Luke there. The fact that he collaborated with Frans Francken I, Jan Brueghel I and other painters living in Flanders who added figural staffage to his paintings, and that he exerted a strong influence on Peeter Neeffs I, seems to confirm this assumption."
4707,"STEENWIJK, Susanna van","(b. 1580s, d. ca. 1653, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steenwyc/susanna/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter (born Susanna Gaspoel), wife of Hendrick van Steenwijk the Younger. She is known for her paintings of architectural exteriors, one of her best-known being The Lakenhal (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal, Leiden), a depiction of the cloth hall (now the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal) in Leiden. The painting, commissioned from her in 1642, illustrates her simplified, almost naive technique, in which attention is given to such significant details as the sculptured plaques on the building's exterior that portray the clothmaking process so important to Leiden's prosperity."
4708,"STEER, Philip Wilson","(b. 1860, Birkenhead, d. 1942, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steer/biograph.html,"
English painter of landscape and occasional portraits and figure studies. He was a leading figure in the Impressionist movement in Britain. "
4709,STEFANO DA ZEVIO,"(b. ca. 1375, Verona, d. 1451, Verona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stefano/biograph.html,"
Stefano (di Giovanni) da Verona (Stefano da Francia; Stefano da Zevio), Italian painter. He was the son of Jean d'Arbois. Vasari first called him Stefano da Verona; in documents he appears as Stefano di Giovanni. The name da Zevio (Stephanus de Gebeto), adopted by local historians, arose from a confusion with Altichiero. Local historians, probably because of Vasari's chronological incoherence in calling him a student of both Agnolo Gaddi and Liberale da Verona, were also responsible for the creation of other apocryphal Stefanos (Stefano jr, Stefano sr, Vincenzo di Stefano).

Stefano da Verona was the principal Veronese painter in the International Gothic style. He was much influenced by Gentile da Fabriano and was probably the master of Pisanello, continuing a sort of proto-Pisanello style as late as 1435 in his signed and dated Adoration of the Magi (Milan, Brera); on the other hand, the Madonna of the Quail (Verona) may be by him or by Pisanello. Most of his works are in Verona (museums and churches).



"
4710,STEFANO DI SANT'AGNESE,(active second half of 14th century),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stefanos/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Venice and documented in Friuli in 1382, this painter is known as Stefano Plebanus (""parishioner"") di Sant'Agnese from the indication in the signature of the Coronation of the Virgin (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice, 1381). Anticipating the courtly taste for naturalistic art, he adopted a soft, sinuous line and delicate colours. He stands out from other painters of his generation for his particular expressive vibrancy.



"
4711,"STEINBACH, Erwin von","(b. ca. 1244, d. 1318, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinbac/biograph.html,"
German architect. The designation ""von Steinbach"" comes from an inscription probably set up at the beginning of the 15th century on the north portal of the façade of Strasbourg Cathedral. Over the centuries Erwin has come to be the archetype of the medieval architect. The whole façade of Strasbourg Cathedral has been attributed to him although his actual work is difficult to determine. It is generally accepted that Erwin headed the façade workshop ca. 1285 and was probably responsible for façade Plan C and Plan D. In 1316 he was building the Virgin Chapel (destroyed 1682) in the nave, on the north side of the choir screen. 



"
4712,"STEINFELD, Franz","(b. 1787, Wien, d. 1868, Pisek)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinfel/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter, son of the sculptor Franz Steinfeld the Elder and father of the painter Wilhelm Steinfeld. From 1802-1812, he studied at the Vienna Academy under Lorenz Janscha (1749-1812), Martin von Molitor (1759-1812) and Albrecht Christoph Dies (1755-1822). He traveled to Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where he studied the seventeenth-century landscape painters. Between 1815 and 1835 he was court painter of Archduke Anton Victor; from 1845 professor at the Vienna Academy."
4713,"STEINL, Matthias","(b. ca. 1644, Salzburg, d. 1727, Dorotheerhof)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinl/biograph.html,"
Matthews Steinl (also Steindel, or Stinle), Austrian sculptor, architect, and engineer. He was one of the country's best known Baroque sculptors, and, together with Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his rival Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, he may be considered one of the most influential architects to introduce the High Baroque style to Austria."
4714,"STEINLE, Edward Jakob von","(b. 1810, Wien, d. 1886, Frankfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinle/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna from 1823, where he was taught by Vincenz Georg Kininger and Leopold Kupelwieser. His training under the latter had a lasting influence on his work, for it was during this period (1826-28) that he learnt about Italian painting of the Quattrocento. In 1828 he went to Rome, where he joined the Nazarenes (Philipp Veit, Friedrich Overbeck and Joseph Führich). He sketched a Visitation, and an Annunciation for the church of Trinità dei Monti in Rome; these were painted as frescoes by his friend Josef Tunner. He worked with Overbeck on the Portiuncula Chapel in Assisi."
4715,"STEINLEN, Théophile Alexandre","(b. 1859, Lausanne, d. 1923, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinlen/biograph.html,"
French painter, born in Switzerland. He studied art at Lausanne and later became active as a textile designer in Mulhause. In 1882 he arrived in Paris where he worked as an illustrator for journals, producing over four hundred lithographs. Besides illustrating advertisements for a variety of products, Steinlen was famous for his posters of cabaret and music hall performers. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is one done for the French singer Yvette Guilbert's performances at the cabaret Les Ambassadeurs, executed in 1894. Guilbert preferred Steinlen's posters to another famous version, done by Toulouse-Lautrec. The two artists are often compared, although Steinlen's poster art, drawn with the same bold simplicity as Lautrec's, is marked by an air of sweetness and a quieter mood. However, his later work for the journals, like that of Lautrec, became increasingly satirical and critical of society."
4716,"STEINMEYER, Johann Gottfried","(b. ca. 1780, Mühlhausen, d. ca. 1851, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steinmey/biograph.html,"
German architect. He grew up in Berlin, where he learned the profession of carpenter. He was trained as an architect at the Bauakademie in Berlin and also worked as a builder in Berlin. Since his legacy was almost completely lost, little is known about his life and origin. A close friendship connected him to Karl Friedrich Schinkel, whom he accompanied on his first trip to Italy in 1803-05."
4717,"STELLA, Jacques","(b. 1596, Lyon, d. 1657, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stella/biograph.html,"
French painter. Stella is an example of a painter who enjoyed great esteem in his lifetime, both as an artist and a patron (of Nicolas Poussin), but whose work is no longer appreciated. Most of the early part of his career was spent in Italy, both in Florence and Rome, and he must have been strongly influenced by the small Madonnas of Raphael. He became a friend of Poussin in Rome and acquired numerous pictures by him, including the Venus and Aeneas now at Rouen. Poussin influenced Stella's sweetly decorative style (which is similar in scale and charm to that of Lubin Baugin) to the point where his pictures became cold and hard and lacking in sentimentality. Unusually for a Frenchman, Stella sometimes painted on a precious ground such as lapis-lazuli or marble, allowing the pattern of the stone to form part of the composition.



"
4718,"STELLA, Fermo da Caravaggio","(b. ca. 1490, Caravaggio, d. ca. 1562, Caravaggio)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stella_f/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and sculptor, active in Lombardy and Piedmont. He was a pupil or a follower of Gaudenzio Ferrari. They collaborated probably as early as 1510; documents show they worked together in Morbegno in 1522."
4719,"STELLA, Paolo","(d. 1552, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stella_p/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, born in Melide, Ticino, active in Bohemia. He was commissioned by Ferdinand I, King of Bohemia (Holy Roman Emperor, 1556-1564), to design the Summer Palace (Belvedere) in the formal gardens of Hradcany Castle and prepared a model of it in Genoa in 1537. The Belvedere was the most important Renaissance building of its time in Central Europe. The expressive and Mannerist traits of this building are evidence against the identification of Paolo Stella with another sculptor known as Paolo Stella Milanese, who in 1525-29 created important works in Venice and Padua."
4720,"STERN, Ignaz","(b. 1679, Mauerkirchen, d. 1748, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stern/ignaz/biograph.html,"
Painter, part of a family of artists and architects of German origin, active in Italy. (In Italy he is known as Ignazio Stella.) He trained under Carlo Cignani in Forlí before settling in Rome in 1701. He returned c. 1713 to Forlí, where he produced many altar and easel paintings for private and monastic patrons in the Emilia-Romagna region."
4721,"STERN, Ludovico","(b. 1709, Roma, d. 1777, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stern/ludovico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists and architects of German origin, active in Italy, son of Ignaz Stern. Ludovico Stern was a prolific portrait and history painter in the circle of Anton Raphael Mengs.
"
4722,"STERN, Raffaele","(b. 1774, Roma, d. 1820, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stern/raffaele/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, part of a family of artists, grandchild of Ludovico Stern."
4723,"STETTER, Wilhelm","(b. ca. 1487, d. 1552, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stetter/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was known as the 'Master W.S. with the Maltese Cross' when his paintings were first grouped together in 1930 but was properly identified in 1952. Stetter was both a religious painter and a Catholic priest (ordained in Basle, 1512). He entered the order of the Knights of St John in Strasbourg c. 1509-10, became the custodian of the order in 1522 and remained there until his death. Inventories suggest that many of Stetter's paintings were created for this order."
4724,"STEVENS, Alfred","(b. 1817, Dorset, d. 1875, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steven_a/biograph.html,"
English sculptor, designer, and painter, the son of a decorator. He was encouraged by a clergyman who lent him things to copy, so that at 15 he was a competent portraitist in the Reynolds tradition. His patron collected £60 and approached Landseer, but Landseer's premium for an apprenticeship was £500, so in 1833 the boy was put on a ship for Naples. No arrangements had been made for him and no further funds were provided; he knew no Italian, got involved in political intrigues, and fell among thieves. He spent eighteen months in and around Naples, and in 1835 walked to Rome, keeping himself by painting and drawing portraits."
4725,"STEVENS, Alfred","(b. 1823, Bruxelles, d. 1906, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/steven_b/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter and lithographer. Born in Belgium, Stevens chose to spend his adult life in Paris where he was a comrade of the French Impressionists. Though never actually one of them, he embraced many of their artistic innovations, including the broken brushwork, dark swaths of background colour, and Japanese elements evident in this painting. He became famous for his society portraits of beautiful aristocratic women and fairly early in his career, became 'hors concours,' an honour which meant his automatic acceptance at every exhibition of the Paris Salon."
4726,"STEVENS, Pieter","(b. ca. 1567, Mechelen, d. after 1624, Prague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stevens/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in Bohemia. He was a free master in Antwerp in 1589. The hypothesis that Stevens visited Italy in the early 1590s cannot be proved; it is based only on a series of small, rather primitive drawings dated 1590 or 1591 (Vienna, Akademie der Bildende Kunst), representing mainly ancient monuments in the vicinity of Rome and Naples. These drawings, however, are probably copies by Stevens, possibly after Jan Breughel the Elder. The earliest original works by Stevens are four drawings dated 1592."
4727,"STEVENSON, David Watson","(b. 1842, Ratho, d. 1904, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stevenso/biograph.html,"
Scottish sculptor, one of the leading sculptors in Scotland during the Victorian era. He trained in Edinburgh under the prominent sculptor William Brodie (1741-1788) and at the Royal Scottish Academy. Success came early to Stevenson, he was awarded the commission for the groups of Labour and Learning for the Prince Consort Memorial in Edinburgh in 1868 and went on to create the monumental statue of William Wallace for the Wallace Monument in Stirling."
4728,"STIELER, Karl Joseph","(b. 1781, Mainz, d. 1858, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stieler/biograph.html,"
German painter. In 1798 he studied under Christoph Fesel (1737-1805) in Würzburg and in 1800 with Heinrich Füger in Vienna, where his style was strongly influenced by English portraiture. After he studied in Paris (1807-08) with François Gérard the influence of Neoclassicism became apparent in his work. He visited Italy in 1809, 1810 and 1812 to do commissioned portraits for various patrons, among them Prince Eugene de Beauharnais (1809; Munich, Bayerische Nationalmuseum) and Joachim Murat, King of Naples (reg 1808-15). In 1812 he went to Munich where he did work for middle-class clients, the nobility and the royal family of Bavaria (e.g. the portrait of Maximilian I Joseph, 1816; Ellingen, Schloss). In 1820 he was appointed court painter to Ludwig I, King of Bavaria (reg 1825-48), and painted several portraits of him. In 1823 he helped co-found the Kunstverein in Munich."
4729,"STIMMER, Tobias","(b. 1539, Schaffhausen, d. 1584, Strasbourg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stimmer/biograph.html,"
Swiss draughtsman, part of a family of artists. Christoph Stimmer I (c. 1490-1562) worked in Konstanz as a schoolmaster from 1520 to 1532, but was also a calligrapher and painter. There are glass paintings (14 panels, 1524-25) signed with his name in Pfullendorf Town Hall, and he also used contemporary prints by such artists as Hans Leu II, Niklaus Manuel and Hans Holbein the Younger as models for his compositions. In 1532 he moved to Schaffhausen, where he became a citizen and a member of the guild in 1535, and worked as a bookbinder in 1558. Of his 11 children, Tobias Stimmer was the most famous, and at least five of his other sons were also artists. Christoph Stimmer II (c. 1522-c. 1562) was a calligrapher, Abel Stimmer (1542-c. 1606) was a painter and etcher, Gideon Stimmer (1545-1577) was a painter and designer of stained glass, Hans Christoffel Stimmer (1549-c. 1578) was a pattern-cutter and Josias Stimmer (1555-after 1574) was a painter."
4730,"STOCK, Andries Jacobsz.","(b. ca. 1580, Antwerpen, d. after 1648, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stock/biograph.html,"
Andries Jacobsz. Stock (Andreas Stockius) was a Dutch printmaker, draftsman, and publisher. He was active in The Hague from 1614 to 1648, but he was in Amsterdam in 1626 where he was imprisoned for alleged counterfeiting. He is known for title pages, portrait prints and illustrations.



"
4731,"STOCKT, Vrancke van der",(c. 1420-1495),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stockt/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The anonymous Brussels painter named the Master of the Prado Redemption after the key painting attributed to him was subsequently identified as Vrancke van der Stockt. He became a master in the Brussels Guild of St Luke in 1445 and in the same year inherited the workshop of his father, Jan van der Stockt (d. after 23 May 1444), where he had doubtless trained. In 1453 he witnessed a deed in the house of Rogier van der Weyden, which suggests that the two were friends and possibly collaborators. Van der Stockt succeeded van der Weyden as official painter to the town on the latter's death in 1464; in 1468 he worked in Bruges on the decorations for the wedding of Margaret of York and Charles the Bold."
4732,"STOFFE, Jan Jacobsz. van der","(b. ca. 1611, Leiden, d. 1682, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stoffe/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He is documented in Leiden between 1644, when he became member of the Painters' Guild, and his death. In 1669 he was dean of that Guild. His earliest painting dates from 1635. His battle scenes were influenced by Esaias van de Velde and by Palamedes Palamedesz."
4733,"STOM, Matthias","(b. ca. 1600, Amersfoort, d. after 1650, Sicily)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stom/biograph.html,"
Matthias Stom (Stomer), Dutch painter, active in Italy. A document was discovered that firmly located Stom's birth in Amersfoort, but his family could have come from the southern Netherlands where the name Stom is fairly common. Although he is referred to as Stomer in art-historical literature, his few signed pictures bear some form of the name Stom, which form also appears in the few documents concerning the artist. It is often stated that he was a student of Gerrit van Honthorst in Utrecht, but this is unlikely since Stom must have started his training before 1620, the year in which van Honthorst returned from Italy."
4734,"STOM, Antonio","(b. 1688, Venezia, d. 1734, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stom_a/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters who between 1680 and 1700 worked in Venice, specializing in the production of battles scenes. The first generation, formed by brothers Matteo and Giovanni (""Zuanne""), was replaced by a second with Antonio (""Tonino"") who carried on the family business. The role played by Antonio Stom within the pictorial Venetian culture in the early decades of the eighteenth century was quite surprising. In fact, he was the author of numerous vedute ""taken from life"" or ""capricci,"" fancy architecture with Roman ruins and obelisks at the edge of sea bays, similar to the Carlevarijs models."
4735,"STONE, Nicholas the Elder","(b. 1586, Exeter, d. 1647, Exeter)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stone/biograph.html,"
British mason-sculptor and architect, trained under Hendrick de Keyser in Amsterdam. and appointed master mason to James I (1619). He worked on the Banqueting House, Whitehall, where he began an association with Inigo Jones. He is best known for his tombs, which include that of Francis Holles (Westminster Abbey) based on Michelangelo's tomb of Giuliano de Medici, and that to John Donne (made from Donne's own design, St Paul's Cathedral).

4736,"STOOP, Dirck Willemsz.","(b. ca. 1618, Utrecht, d. 1686, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stoop/dirck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and etcher. He was the son of Willem Jansz. Stoop (fl. 1633-44, d. 1646), a stained-glass artist with whom he probably trained. Dirck or possibly his brother Maerten Willemsz. was an apprentice in the Utrecht Guild of St Luke in 1638. Dirck probably travelled to Italy in 1635-45, where he may have painted Rest during the Hunt (1643; Copenhagen, Nationalmuseum). Between 1647 and 1652 he was back in Utrecht.  Later he worked at the court in Lisbon.

4737,"STOOP, Maerten","(b. 1620, Rotterdam, d. 1647, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stoop/maerten/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. His father was the glass painter Willem Jansz. van Stoop and his brother Dirck was also a painter. Only some twenty paintings by him are known, surviving works are limited by the brevity of his career. He specialised in genre painting and in particular guardroom subjects, portraying off-duty officers in scenes of relaxation and merriment.

There are no surviving works by the eldest son, Johannes (c. 1630-1673). Abraham Storck, the youngest, was the best known of the three artists. He was a versatile artist, renowned for his marine paintings, topographical views and Italianate harbour scenes. His brother Jacobus Storck painted similar subjects, but his works are fewer and less accomplished. Both brothers' pictures are mainly of a modest size and painted on canvas more often than on panel."

English silversmith, the son of Thomas Storr, a silver chaser. He was apprenticed in 1785 to Andrew Fogelberg. In 1792 he entered his first mark in partnership with William Frisbee but within months registered his own hallmark, and by 1796 he had set up a workshop in Air Street, London. His earliest works were in a restrained neoclassical style, but such was the quality of his work that soon after 1800 he began working, apparently exclusively, for Rundell Bridge and Rundell - the royal goldsmiths, after which his work was executed in the firm's elaborate house style."

Tobias Stranover (Stranovius), one of the leading decorative painters working in England in the early part of the 18th-century, was born in Nagyszeben, Hungary (now Sibiu, Romania). He was the son of the local painter Jeremias Stranover (?-1702). His elder brother, Jeremias Stranover was also a painter in Nagyszeben, just like his father-in-law, Jacob Bogdani (Jakab Bogdány). Stranover travelled to Germany and England and settled in London where he married Elizabeth Bogdani, daughter of Jacob Bogdani. It is thought that the two artists collaborated together, painting exotic birds and wild life. Together with Bogdani, Stranover was one of the foremost decorative painters working in England in the early part of the 18th century. They specialized in the painting of exotic birds and wildlife, their work brought a lightness and exoticism to English still-life and animal paintings which were missing in the early English works of Marmaduke Craddock and Francis Barlow."
4749,"STRAUB, Johann Baptist","(b. 1705, Wiesensteig, d. 1784, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/straub/biograph.html,"
Bavarian Rococo sculptor. He studied tan years at the Academy in Vienna with Georg Raphael Donner. From 1737 court sculptor in Munich. Beside Egid Quirin Asam he was the leading sculptor of the South-German Rococo. His works include the high altar, St Michael's church, Berg-am-Laim, Munich, and altars in the monastic churches of Ettal and Schäftlarn. Günther was his pupil.

Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, the son of Juriaen van Streeck. After learning to draw from his father, he studied sculpting with Willem van der Hoeven. In 1683 he married Maria van Hokkum. When his father died in 1687, Hendrick was advised by Melchior de Hondecoeter to stick to painting, and so he became a student of Emmanuel de Witte. He learned to paint church interiors so well that his art was hard to tell apart from De Witte's."

4752,"STRÉSOR, Henri","(b. ca. 1613, Paris, d. 1679, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/stresor/biograph.html,"
French painter. Very little is known about the life of this artist. Said to be of German extraction and to have lived in Paris from 1644. Having embraced Catholicism, Strésor became a portrait painter at the French Court, executing  portraits in the 1650s and 1660s of Louis XIV, the Marquis d'Aguilar, Pierre Seguin and Monteil de Grignan, the Archbishop of Arles, some of which were engraved. During the 1640s and 1650s, he also seems to have painted genre paintings in the manner of the Le Nain, which show the influence of the French Caravaggistes."
4753,"STRIGEL, Bernhard","(b. 1460, Memmingen, d. 1528, Memmingen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/strigel/bernhard/biograph.html,"
German painter, son or nephew of Hans Strigel II. His training with Hans Striegel II shows stylistically in his early works in the canton of Grisons, e.g. the Last Judgement (1486; Brigels, pilgrimage chapel of St Eusebius) and an altarpiece at Disentis (1489; St Johann Baptist). In the 1480s and 1490s he also worked in the studio of Ivo Strigel (1430-1516). Motifs in his pictures stem from engravings by Martin Schongauer and from Ulm book woodcuts. He met Bartholomäus Zeitblom as a fellow worker on the high altar (1493–94) of Blaubeuren Abbey, both being influenced by Netherlandish art: Zeitblom by Rogier van der Weyden but Strigel primarily by Dieric Bouts. This influence is also seen in his Adoration of the Magi altarpiece (c. 1500; Memmingen, Städtmuseum). The altar of the Virgin for the monastery at Salem (1507–08; Salem, Schloss) has links with Dürer's graphic work: an increasing three-dimensionality and monumentalization of the objects and figures, and their disposition in space. Through the influence of Hans Holbein the Elder and of Augsburg portraiture his work achieved a stabilization of form c. 1517–20. In the Crucifixion (after 1515; Prague, National Gallery) the influence of Lucas Cranach becomes apparent."

He entered the Capuchin Order in about 1597, hence his nicknames, Il Prete Genovese (the Genoese priest) and Il Cappuccino (the Capuchin). In about 1610 he was allowed to leave his community to look after his sick and widowed mother, and after she died in 1630 he is said to have been pressurized to return, this accounting for his move in 1631 to Venice where he spent the rest of his life).

Italian painter who came from a side-branch of one of the most important Florentine families. He was a pupil and employee of many years of Fra Angelico on whom he was stylistically dependent. Vasari remembers him as one of the first and most faithful followers of Fra Angelico and indeed he is documented several times in Angelico's workshop, in the convent of San Domenico in Fiesole, during the 1430s.

American portrait painter. With Copley he was the outstanding American portraitist of his period and he is regarded as the creator of a distinctively American style of portraiture. Much of his early career was spent in Scotland (c. 1771-72). England (1775-87), and Ireland (1787-92). After he settled permanently in America in 1792, he worked briefly in New York City, then moved to Philadelphia, and finally settled in Boston in 1805. He quickly established himself as the outstanding portraitist in the country and painted many of the notables of the new republic. His portraits of George Washington are his most famous works - he created three types, all of which were endlessly copied: the 'Vaughan' type (National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1795), the 'Lansdowne' type (Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, 1796), and the 'Athenaeum' type (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1796), which is one of the most famous images in American art, being used on the country's one-dollar bill."

Proving a talented artist while his family was in poverty, he was apprenticed to a fan painter to support the family financially. However, in around 1742, he was able to travel to Italy (albeit on foot) for his artistic improvement, working there as a cicerone and a painter, learning Latin, Italian and Greek, and studying Italian and Roman art and architecture. There he met Nicholas Revett (1720-1804), a young East Anglian nobleman and amateur architect on his Grand Tour."

German draughtsman, illustrator, printmaker, decorative artist, painter, sculptor and architect. He was noted for his treatment of erotic and comic aspects of mythological themes. He drew eagerly as a child, soon becoming a gifted caricaturist. From 1878 to 1881 he attended the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich, where he received particular encouragement from Ferdinand Barth (1842-1892). From 1881 to 1885 he studied at the Munich Akademie, where he was taught by Wilhelm Lindenschmit (1829-1895) and Ferdinand Löfftz (1845-1910)."

After travelling to France and Italy together with Eduard Knoblauch (1801-1865) in 1829 and 1830 and to Russia together with Heinrich Strack in 1831, Stüler became Hofbauinspektor (Royal Buildings Inspector), Hofbaurat (Royal privy councilor for buildings) and director of the commission for the building of the Berliner Stadtschloss in 1832."
4771,"SUBLEYRAS, Pierre","(b. 1699, Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, d. 1749, Rome)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/subleyra/biograph.html,"
French painter who settled permanently in Rome after winning the Prix du Rome in 1727. He painted a variety of subjects, including portraits and still-lifes, but he is most highly regarded for his religious paintings, which are much more serious in spirit than most French work in the Rococo period. His most famous work is the Mass of St Basil, painted for the St Peter's, but now in the Santa Maria degli Angeli. This huge picture was highly acclaimed when it was unveiled in 1748, but Subleyras died before he could follow up his success. He has subsequently been something of an underrated figure, but a major exhibition of his work in Paris and Rome in 1987 did much to establish his reputation as one of the outstanding French painters of his period.

American architect, writer and draftsman. He was the leading force of progressive architecture in Chicago at its most formative period in the 1890s. He is known for his tall office buildings, skyscrapers, and department stores, often executed with his partner Dankmar Adler. While Sullivan embraced the new concept of industrialized architecture and steel frame construction, he covered his buildings with delicate ornament, often with organic or plant motifs.

4773,"SULLY, Thomas","(b. 1783, Horncastle, d. 1872, Philadelphia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sully/biograph.html,"
The preeminent American portrait painter of his period, active mainly in Philadelphia. He was born in England, but went to America as a child. Subsequently he made two visits to England, in 1809, when he studied with West, and in 1837-38, to paint Queen Victoria for the St George Society of Philadelphia (a preliminary version is in the Wallace Collection, London). His style, distinguished by fluid, glossy brushwork and romantic warmth and dash, reveals his great admiration for Lawrence. In his later work, however, he tended towards a genteel sentimentality. Sully was highly successful and extremely productive. He is said to have painted some 2,000 portraits (he also made miniatures), but his best-known work is probably one of his (also very numerous) history paintings - Washington Crossing the Delaware (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1819).

He trained with Bernard Picart, whom he followed to the Netherlands in 1710. He returned to France in 1715, to combine his work as a printmaker with publishing and selling prints. In 1730 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale, and on 30 July 1735 was received (reçu) on presenting as morceaux de réception engraved portraits of the painters Joseph Christophe after François-Hubert Drouais, and Louis de Boullogne the younger after Antoine Mathieu. In the same year he purchased the post of Contrôleur Général des Rentes at the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. He contributed to most of the engraved collections which appeared during his lifetime. He engraved both portraits and genre scenes, and was sought after for his careful style and his firm and precise lines. He owned a considerable collection of prints, which were sold by Pierre-François Basan in November 1769."

He lived in The Hague in 1640, when he was mentioned in a document together with the painter Johan Pietersz. Schoeff (c. 1608-1666). Shortly after its establishment in Dordrecht he became a member of the painting fraternity. Documents of creditors seem to indicate that Susenier had regular financial difficulties."
4778,"SUSINI, Antonio","(b. before 1580, Firenze, d. 1624, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/susini/antonio/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, member of a family of sculptors and bronze-founders, and one of Giambologna's most important assistants. He specialized in the production of bronze statuettes, many of which were reproductions either of antique statues or of Giambologna's original designs, but he also produced work on his own account. He appears to have been active in Giambologna's Borgo Pinti workshop by 1580, where he remained until 1600, at which point he set up his own studio in the Via de' Pilastri. Giambologna gave Antonio a considerable number of his own working models, and the latter continued to cast statuettes from these long after Giambologna's death, which has complicated the attributional problems associated with the production of Giambologna's workshop.

Italian sculptor, nephew of Antonio Susini. He studied in his uncle's workshop, becoming a highly skilled bronze-caster: his first documented commission, in 1614, is for a bronze altar frontal (untraced) for the Pitti Palace. But he also worked in marble, and the marble Dissimulation (Florence, Pitti) - in Giambologna's idiom, but with gestures derived from the Antique - may be his earliest surviving work. He travelled to Rome c. 1624-26, making copies of newly discovered antique works such as the Hermaphrodite (Paris, Louvre) for casting as bronze statuettes."
4780,"SUSTERMANS, Justus","(b. 1597, Antwerpen, d. 1681, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/susterma/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. During his lifetime Giusto Suttermans (as he signed his name), court painter to the Medici, was considered the foremost portrait painter in Italy, the peer of van Dyck, Rubens or Holbein. His best works show that he deserved his contemporaries' esteem, but time, the extinction of the Medici family and the failure of art historians to recognize the difference between his autograph works and those by his workshop, copyists and contemporary Florentine painters have all contributed to tarnish his once high reputation.

Painter, draughtsman and designer, son of Lambert Sustris. He was presumably first taught by his father. Records show that Friedrich Sustris was probably in Rome in 1560 and certainly in Florence from 1563 to 1567, where he participated in the decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio and worked on Michelangelo's catafalque under the direction of Vasari (1564). In the following year he drew cartoons for Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici's tapestry works and became a member of the Accademia del Disegno."

Painter, part of a family of artists of Dutch descent, active in Italy and Germany. Lambert Sustris was a follower of Titian, and was influenced by Venetian and Florentine Mannerism. He trained in Amsterdam and by the early to mid-1530s was in Rome; a graffito with his signature is in the Domus Aurea next to that of Maartin van Heemskerck, who was there in 1532–36. He was probably in Venice c. 1535, in the studio of Titian. His characteristic thin, dry handling can be seen in the landscape of Titian’s Presentation of the Virgin (1539, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). There is a similar landscape in the Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) now attributed to Sustris. His presence in Titian's workshop in this period is supported by his Venus (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), a copy of Titian’s Venus of Urbino (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), which left Venice in 1538."

Flemish painter from Bruges. He was always referred to by Jacques-Louis David as 'l'ignare Suvée', and was, like David, a pupil of Vien, and David's lifelong rival for the leadership of Neoclassicism in France. He came from Bruges to Paris and won the Prix de Rome against David in 1771, spending a year at the École des Élèves protégés, and then going to Rome 1772-78, after which he returned to Paris and became  Agréé (1779) and Member of the Academy (1780) and Painter to the King. He returned to Rome as Director of the French Academy there, in 1792, but lost his job when David became dictator of the arts. He was imprisoned (like David) under the Terror. 1794-95, but was reappointed to Rome by Napoleon in 1801 and remained there until his death. His works are now largely forgotten, but there are several in Bruges and others in French provincial museums, including Besançon and Lille.

During his stay in Rome he became a protégé of King William I of the Netherlands. In 1817 he settled in Amsterdam and worked as an architect for the Dutch Crown.

From c. 1565 until his death he worked in Leiden, except for a brief interval in 1573-74. From 1576 he was a member of the city council and between 1586 and 1607 was alderman on 13 occasions and burgomaster of Leiden 5 times. In addition, he was active as a painter of narrative pieces and portraits and was also a designer of prints, stained-glass windows, silver, seals and wall hangings, most of which work was commissioned by the city of Leiden and his fellow regents. His Self-portrait (1568; Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal, Leiden) is one of the most important north Netherlandish self-portraits of the 16th century and bears evident traces of his training in Antwerp. In his later portraits a more provincial style emerged."
4790,"SWANENBURG, Willem Isaacsz. van","(b. 1580, Leiden, d. 1612, Leiden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/swanenbu/willem/biograph.html,"
Dutch engraver, son of Isaac Claesz. van Swanenburg. He trained as a painter with his father and also assisted him later in executing commissions. He also learnt the art of engraving, possibly from Jacques de Gheyn, and became one of the best young Dutch engravers of the early 17th century. His work includes prints after work by Joachim Wtewael, Abraham Bloemaert and Peter Paul Rubens. An early death cut short his promising career.

4791,"SWANEVELT, Herman van","(b. ca. 1600, Woerden, d. 1655, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/swanevel/biograph.html,"Dutch painter who probably was born in about 1600 at Woerden, near Utrecht. By 1623 he was in Paris, and in the following year he was in Rome. There is no evidence to support the tradition that he lived in Rome about 1627/28 in the same house as Claude Lorrain, but it is certain that he had contact with other French artists as well as Netherlandish ones in the city.

"
4792,"SWART VAN GRONINGEN, Jan","(b. ca. 1500, Groningen, d. ca. 1560, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/swart/biograph.html,"
Northern Netherlandish printmaker, painter and designer of stained glass. Van Mander recorded that Swart spent several years in Gouda (probably c. 1522-3), where he was the teacher of Adriaen (Pietersz.) Crabeth (d 1553), brother of the famous stained-glass designers Dirk and Wouter Crabeth. From van Mander it is also known that Swart travelled to Italy. He may have gone from Venice to Constantinople, before he designed another work mentioned by van Mander, the Procession of Turkish Riders, a set of five woodcuts (1526) depicting Sultan Suleyman the Great and his entourage and executed by Willem Liefrinck (1490-1542). Van Mander did not know any paintings by Swart, but he reported that he did paint landscapes and figures, according to him, in the style of Jan van Scorel.


"
4793,"SWEERTS, Michiel","(b. 1624, Bruxelles, d. 1664, Goa)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/sweerts/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, an enigmatic and exceedingly attractive artist. Nothing is known of his training or early career. From about 1646 to about 1656 he was in Rome, where he came into contact with the Bamboccianti. He painted genre scenes in their manner, but his work is in a class apart because of the quiet, melancholy dignity of his figures and his exquisite silvery tonality. His other pictures in Rome included views of artists' studios (an example dated 1652 is in the Detroit Institute of Arts). By 1656 Sweerts had returned to his native Brussels, where in 1659 he became a member of the painters' guild."
4794,"SWOBODA, Rudolph Der G.","(b. 1859, Wien, d. 1914)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/swoboda/biograph.html,"
Austrian painter. He studied under Leopold Carl Müller (1834-1892), and voyaged with him to Egypt in 1880. He was a well-known Orientalist."
4795,"SWOL, Ambrosius van",(active 1640-1680 in Utrecht),https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/swol/biograph.html,"
Dutch sculptor, carver and frame-maker whose activity is documented between 1643 and 1679 in Utrecht. This less-known artist worked in the style of Albert Vinckenbrinck. He must have had something of a reputation in his day as a carver of picture frames and figures.



"
4796,"SYRLIN, Jörg the Elder","(b. 1420s, Ulm, d. 1481, Ulm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/syrlin/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. He was resident in Ulm from 1449 to 1491; his family were joiners from the nearby town of Söflingen. In 1456 he owned a house in the Ulmer Gasse and by then was probably running a workshop for which a number of sculptors worked on a temporary basis from the end of the 1460s. He himself probably carved only the minor sculptures in his works of joinery. His art-historical status rests mainly on whether or not busts at the ends of the Ulm Minster choir-stalls can be attributed to him. If they can, he was one of the best sculptors of German Late Gothic, but if not, his oeuvre amounts to no more than some pieces of joinery, some large joinery commissions (executed by his collaborators) and possibly some sculptures of average quality.



"
4797,"SZÉKELY, Bertalan","(b. 1835, Kolozsvár, d. 1910, Budapest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/szekely/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter, an outstanding personality of Hungarian romantic painting, one of the most important exponents of Hungarian history painting. Between 1851 and 1855 he studied at the Academy of Vienna, then in Munich Székely's name became inseparable from Hungarian history painting. He depicted chapters from the stormy past of the Hungarian nation, but in the same time he always had something genuine to say to the people of his own time. The Discovery of Louis Il's Dead Body, Women of Eger, Mohács, King László V and Ulrik Cillei are among the most important of his history paintings."
4798,"SZINYEI MERSE, Pál","(b. 1845, Szinyeújfalu, d. 1920, Jernye)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/s/szinyei/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He began his studies at the Munich Academy in 1864; between 1867 and 1869 he was a pupil of Karl Piloty's. Szinyei's early sketches already revealed his search for new ways of expression. His friendship with his master, as well as that with Wilhelm Leibl and Hans Makart, left no mark on his plein-air painting. The sketches made in 1869 for The Swing and Clothes Drying (Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest) are the earliest examples of Hungarian and Central European Impressionism."
4799,"TACCA, Pietro","(b. 1577, Carrara, d. 1640, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tacca/father/biograph.html,"
Florentine sculptor in bronze, the chief pupil and follower of Giambologna. After the latter's death Tacca completed a number of his works and succeeded him as sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany. It was his technical and stylistic acumen in bronze, however that gained him the patronage of the Medici Dukes. He was granted the use for his lifetime of Giambologna studio by Cosimo II in 1616 and later served Ferdinand II as court artist in Spain."
4800,"TACCA, Ferdinando","(b. 1619, Firenze, d. ca. 1688, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tacca/son/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and scenographer, son of Pietro Tacca. He applied his artistic and engineering talents to a variety of projects. Trained as a sculptor, he also designed theaters, stage sets, machinery, and court spectacles. He received his first training from his father and in 1640 also assumed his father's position at the Medici court as sculptor to Ferdinand II, grand duke of Tuscany. As director of the sculpture workshop and foundry in Borgo Pinti, which he inherited from his father, Tacca produced large bronze equestrian monuments, figural groups, and smaller-scale works for the Medicis in the 1640s."

Sienese painter, active in Pisa, Perugia, San Gimignano, and Volterra, his native city. He was the son of the barber Bartolo di Mino, and he was under 25 in 1386 when he was first recorded, painting statuettes of angels for the new choir-stalls in Siena Cathedral. In 1388–89 he was a counsellor to the Cathedral Works and in 1389 he was first listed as an independent painter."

Italian architect and sculptor, part of a family of artists. Three members of the family were active in Florence in the 14th century: Francesco Talenti and his son Simone Talenti were both involved in works on the cathedral, while Fra Jacopo Talenti, presumed to be Francesco's brother, worked at the monastery of Santa Maria Novella. Another of Francesco's sons, Piero, mentioned on 5 May 1379 in connection with the building of the Loggia dei Lanzi, is otherwise unknown."
4804,"TALENTI, Simone","(b. ca. 1330, d. after 1383)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/talenti/simone/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor and architect, part of a family of architects and sculptors, son of Francesco Talenti. He was one of the foremost sculptors and architects of his day in Florence, participating in the building of the cathedral, Orsanmichele and the Loggia dei Lanzi. Simone probably served his apprenticeship in Florence, but details of this are not known. His sculpture shows the influence of Orcagna, suggesting that he may have been involved in work on Orcagna's tabernacle in Orsanmichele (1352-59) at the start of his career.



"
4805,"TALPA, Bartolo",(active c. 1495 in Mantua),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/talpa/biograph.html,"
Italian medalist. He is possibly identical with an artist named Bartolino Topino, called the Philosopher. Little is known about his life and career except that he worked for the Gonzaga court in Mantua and was a pupil of Andrea Mantegna."
4806,"TAMAGNI, Vincenzo","(b. 1492, San Gimignano, d. 1530, San Gimignano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tamagni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Sodoma, whom he assisted on the frescoes in the monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, near Siena. In 1510-12 he executed frescoes of the Virgin and Child with Saints and Others in the ex-pharmacy of the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Croce at Montalcino (Siena) and these show clearly the influence of Sodoma. He then moved to Rome, where he entered the shop of Raphael and probably worked on the decoration of the Loggetta of Cardinal Bernardo Bibbiena in the Vatican; his frescoes of 1516 in the apse of Santa Maria at Arrone (Terni) reflect contemporary Roman ideas, in particular from Raphael's Vatican Stanze and from Baldassare Peruzzi. He then assisted in the decoration of the Vatican Logge, where, on the basis of the frescoes at Arrone, several scenes can be attributed to him, including the Anointing of David, the Adoration of the Magi and the Last Supper. According to Vasari, he also decorated façades (destroyed) of numerous Roman houses."
4807,"TAMM, Franz Werner von","(b. 1658, Hamburg, d. 1724, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tamm/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Italy and Austria. He was first trained in Hamburg by Dietrich von Sosten (fl 1669; d 1695) and Johann Joachim Pfeiffer (1662-1701). Although he initially leant towards historical painting, later he painted only still-lifes. Resident in Rome from 1685 to 1695, he was introduced into the city's Flemish/Italian circle of artists by Gaspar van Wittel. He worked occasionally with Pieter van Bloemen and Carel van Vogelaer (1653-95), then became a follower of Carlo Maratti, who painted the figures in his still-lifes. Through Maratti he gained commissions from the Roman patrician families, and their patronage made him known in Spain, France, England and Germany.

French painter, part of a family of artists. Between 1732 and 1750 he was in Stockholm with his father, Guillaume-Thomas Taraval, who was also his first teacher. At his father's death he went to Paris and entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Pierre. In 1756 he won the Prix de Rome with Job Reproached by his Wife (Marseille, Musée des Beaux-Arts), and then spent the years 1756-59 at the Ecole des Elèves Protégés. From 1759 to 1763 he was at the Académie de France in Rome."

American painter, illustrator and teacher. He attended drawing lessons at the Normal Art School, Boston, MA, and art classes with W. A. G. Claus. From 1877 to 1880 he was apprenticed to a lithographic company in Boston. In 1879 Tarbell entered the School of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where he was a pupil of Otto Grundmann (1844-90), a former student of Baron Hendrik Leys in Antwerp."
4813,"TARCHIANI, Filippo","(b. 1576, Firenze, d. 1645, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tarchian/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was a pupil of Gregorio Pagani. He spent seven years in Rome (from 1601-1607). Upon his return to Florence, Tarchiani began to work in a more naturalistic idiom, undoubtedly also influenced by the Neapolitan painters of the Gentileschi family as well as by Battistello Caracciolo, who also worked at the grand ducal court. "
4814,"TARDIEU, Nicolas-Henry","(b. 1674, Paris, d. 1749, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tardieu/biograph.html,"
French engraver. He was the son of a master coppersmith. He received his initial training as an engraver in Jean Le Pautre's studio, before going to the workshop of the Audran family. There he learnt the free traditions of French engraving, in which etching played a leading role, the burin being used only for finishing the plate. Tardieu intended to complete his education in Italy but instead took employment in Lyon with Germain Audran (1631-1710) and worked there for several years."
4815,"TARGONE, Cesare",(active 1575-1590),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/targone/biograph.html,"
Italian goldsmith. He was born probably in Venice but was active primarily in Rome and Florence during the late 16th century. The style of his work suggests that he was probably trained in Rome. Supporting this conjecture is a document indicating that in 1582 he was a member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon (Assembly of Illustrious Artists), one of the most prestigious artists' organizations in Rome. In 1585 records show that he was in Florence working with Antonio Susini on Giambologna's gold reliefs for the studiolo of the Medici Duke Ferdinando I, but Targone's role in this project is not specified.



"
4816,"TARSIA, Antonio","(b. ca. 1662, Venezia, d. 1739, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tarsia/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He was one of the most active Venetian sculptors at the beginning of the 18th century and must have been well known by 1705, the first year from which documentation relating to him survives, since he was entrusted with important figures for the Valier mausoleum (c. 1705; Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice). For this he sculpted the figure of Doge Silvestro Valier, an allegory of Richness and a relief representing Peace. These works show the influence of Filippo Parodi's dynamism, combined with classical accents that link him with Pietro Baratta (who also worked on the Valier mausoleum) and with Giuseppe Torretti."
4817,"TARUFFI, Emilio","(b. 1633, Bologna, d. 1696, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/taruffi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and copyist. He was a pupil of Francesco Albani, whose influence is apparent in his early altarpiece of St Lawrence (c. 1654; Ravenna, Santa Maria in Porto). He may subsequently have studied with Carlo Cignani, with whom he collaborated on frescoes (e.g. Francis I ) in the Sala Farnese, Palazzo Pubblico, Bologna (1658-60; in situ), and, later, on frescoes representing scenes from the Life of St Andrew in Sant'Andrea della Valle, Rome (1662-65; in situ). His few surviving works also include two undated altarpieces: SS John Abbot and Maurice (Parma, San Giovanni Evangelista) and the Virgin with SS Martin, Agnes and Christina (Casalvecchio di Reno, nr Bologna, parish church). The Virgin Appearing to St Peter Celestine (1682; San Giovanni Battista dei Celestini, Bologna) is his best-known painting. It exhibits his familiarity with the works of Annibale Carracci and Guercino, and is notable for its stylish incorporation of the classical conventions of Bolognese painting.

The son of a furrier named Domenico Tassi, Agostino Tassi, who aspired to nobility, invented the story of his adoption by the Marchese Tassi. When still young he left Rome for Tuscany where he was employed by the Medici perhaps briefly in Florence and for many years in Livorno. In all likelihood his long stay there, interrupted by visits to Rome in 1599 and to Genoa in 1606, was at least in part dictated by punishment for a crime. Little is known of his artistic formation, which probably included contact with Paul Bril and Giulio Parigi."
4823,"TAUNAY, Nicolas Antoine","(b. 1755, Paris, d. 1830, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/taunay/biograph.html,"
French painter, illustrator, teacher. He began his studies in painting in Paris, in 1768, in the studios of François Bernard Lépicié, Nicolas Guy Brenet and Francisco Casanova. At the age of 17, he dedicated himself to landscape painting. From 1777 onwards, he exhibited at the event known as 'Jeunesse' and at the Salon de la Correspondance, both of which were non-official. In 1784, he was accepted as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This title allowed him to participate in official events, and also led to the award of a three-year pension at the Academy of the Palazzo Mancini, in Rome."

Flemish painter, active in England. She was the eldest daughter of Simon Bening, the leading illuminator of the Ghent-Bruges school. She came to England c. 1545 with her husband, George Teerlinc of Blankenberge, and in 1546 was appointed royal 'paintrix' to Henry VIII, perhaps to help to fill the gap left by the recent deaths of Hans Holbein the Younger and Lucas Horenbout. Her annuity of £40 was larger than theirs. Teerlinc was employed as a gentlewoman in the royal households of both Mary I and Elizabeth I and her husband as a Gentleman Pensioner."

Hungarian painter. Telepy, a pupil of Miklós Barabás, studied in Munich and at the Venice Academy in 1852-57. He visited Rome in 1857. Initially, he painted portraits in Barabás's style, but he also did some altar pictures.  His later academic-romantic landscapes were inspired by his experiences abroad (Swiss Landscape, and Rome) and in Hungary (Ruins of Diósgyõr Castle, Dévény"", Lake Balaton at Aliga, Mátraszentkereszt etc.). From 1861 until his death, he was the secretary of the Art Society in Budapest. In this capacity he played an important role in the art life of his time.

Italian architect, civil engineer and art historian. As an architect he is best known for the small neo-Palladian church of Santa Maria Maddalena (La Maddalena) in Venice; as an art historian he is acclaimed for his Vite dei piu celebri architetti e scultori veneziani che fiorirono nel secolo decimosesto (Lives of the most famous Venetian architects and sculptors who flourished in the sixteenth century). He lived and worked almost entirely in Venice and was a member of the circle of artists and intellectuals who frequented the house of the British consul and connoisseur Joseph Smith.

4827,"TEMPEL, Abraham van den","(b. 1622/23, Leeuwarden, d. 1672, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tempel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the son of the Frisian painter and Mennonite minister Lambert Jacobsz.. He received his training in Amsterdam from Jacob Backer c. 1642-6, after which he took up residence in Leiden. He married there in 1648. The influence of Backer is evident in several of his early biblical and allegorical paintings, for instance in three allegories, including the Maiden of Leiden Crowned by Minerva, which he painted in 1650-51 for the Lakenhal (the Cloth Hall) in Leiden (all Leiden, Stedelijk Museum Lakenhal). He later turned primarily to portrait painting, of which there are several dozen surviving works dating from 1660, when he moved to Amsterdam, until his death. Good examples are the pendant portraits of the Leiden cloth-manufacturer Pieter de la Court and his second wife Catharina van der Voort (1667; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum)."
4828,"TEMPESTA, Antonio","(b. 1555, Firenze, d. 1630, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tempesta/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Enrolled at the Accademia del Disegno in Florence on 8 December 1576, he was a pupil of Santi di Tito, then of Joannes Stradanus, with whom he worked under Giorgio Vasari on the interior decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. He then went to Rome, where he again had links with artists from the Netherlands. He and Matthijs Bril were commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII to paint the Transfer of the Relics of St Gregory of Nazianzus (1572) and other religious scenes in the loggias on the third floor of the Vatican Palace. In Tempesta's frescoes in the Palazzina Gambara at the Villa Lante in Bagnaia (1578-09), the hunting and fishing scenes, sweeping landscapes and urban backdrops again reveal the influence of Netherlandish art. From 1579 to 1583 Tempesta participated in the decoration of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, notably of the Scala Regia. He is also known to have collaborated on the frescoes in the Villa d'Este at Tivoli."

Italian sculptor. From 1803 he trained under Lorenzo Bartolini at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Carrara, where he was also influenced by his uncle, Pietro Marchetti (active 1789-1850), the professor of sculpture, and by the French painter Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Desmarais (1756-1813). In 1813 he won a scholarship to study in Rome and moved there in 1814. He visited art exhibitions and museums, took lessons in painting the nude at the Académie de France and attended the studio of Gaspare Landi. As a fundamental test for all aspiring sculptors, he copied one of The Dioscuri, colossal Roman statues of Castor and Pollux located on Monte Cavallo (now Piazza del Quirinale), though he destroyed his copy."

Their son Mattheus Gansneb Tengnagel later made his name as a poet. Jan Tengnagel's only recorded pupil was Laurens Heinrich Hellewich. In 1618 Tengnagel was referred to as a famous painter in Theodore Rodenburgh's poem eulogizing the city of Amsterdam. Before 1619 he was an officer of the Guild of St Luke in Amsterdam, and later he held high office on Amsterdam's governing bodies."
4831,"TENIERS, Abraham","(b. 1629, Antwerpen, d. 1670, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/teniers/abraham/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, part of a family of painters. He was the son of David Teniers the Elder, and the brother of David Teniers the Younger. He was devoted to painting genre scenes, especially those designed for tapestry cartoons. He trained with his brother David, reached the master's degree in 1645-1646, when he entered the Guild of St Luke in Antwerp. He painted popular genre scenes similar to those by his brother David, but of much lesser quality. The difference with his brother is based on the use of more metallic colour gradations. However, he maintained a certain quality in his work, as evidenced by the fact that the Archduke Leopold William appointed him as a painter.

4832,"TENIERS, David the Elder","(b. 1582, Antwerpen, d. 1649, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/teniers/jan1/biograph.html,"
David Teniers the Elder (David I) was a Flemish Late Mannerist painter, mainly of religious subjects, who worked in Antwerp. He may have been associated with Rubens before going to Rome, where he worked in the Elsheimer circle, c. 1600-05. He became a master in Antwerp in 1606, but was constantly in debt and was active mainly as a dealer in his last years. The working lives of David the Elder and his son David the Younger (David II) - by far the most famous of the family - overlapped in the 1630s, and it is not clear who painted certain pictures in that period; what is clear that many of the paintings ascribed to David I in the 19th century are by David II.

"
4835,"TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick","(b. 1588, Deventer, d. 1629, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/terbrugg/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, one of the earliest and finest exponents of Caravaggism in northern Europe. Born into a Catholic family, he grew up in Utrecht, studied there with Bloemaert, then spent about a decade in Rome (c. 1604-1614). On his return to the Netherlands he became with Honthorst the leader of Caravaggism associated with the Utrecht school. A second journey to Italy (c. 1620) has been postulated, as his later works are generally more thoroughly Caravaggesque than his earlier ones.

"
4836,"TERILLI, Francesco",(active 1610-1630),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/terilli/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. His signature is often accompanied by the adjective 'Feltrensis', which suggests that he was a native of Feltre, although there is no documentary evidence of this. However, numerous works either signed by or attributed to the sculptor are scattered throughout the Feltre district, for example the Redeemer, St Peter and St Prosdocimus (all Feltre Cathedral), and a bronze door-knocker with a Blessed Bernardino (Feltre, Museo Civico). He was influenced by the work of Alessandro Vittoria, and his sculptures, such as the bronze pair of John the Baptist and the Redeemer (1610; Venice, Chiesa del Redentore) and the wooden equestrian monument of Pompeo Giustiniani (Venice, SS Giovanni e Paolo), erected in 1616-17 at the request of the Venetian senate, are characterized by both delicacy and restraint."
4837,"TERRENI, Giuseppe Maria","(b. 1739, Livorno, d. 1811, Livorno)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/terreni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and printmaker. He was particularly active in his hometown where he painted many frescoes which were destroyed in World War II. In 1766 he was introduced to the grand ducal court in Florence, and later painted a room in the Palazzo Pitti. In 1773-78 he painted frescoes in the Medici Villa Poggio Imperiale. Between 1783 and 1785, he executed panoramic views of Livorno and its port in which the influence of Giuseppe Zocchi and Jakob Philipp Hackert can be seen."
4838,"TERZIO, Francesco","(b. ca. 1523, Bergamo, d. 1591, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/terzio/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. His date of birth is deduced from his will, drawn up in 1551, in which he gave his age as around 28 years. He presumably trained in Bergamo during the 1530s and 1540s. In 1550 he painted a large canvas of the Crucifixion for SS Bartolomeo e Stefano, Lallo, near Bergamo, in which the style is close to the late work of Lorenzo Lotto. A letter from Terzio to Pietro Aretino, written in Milan and dated 11 July 1551, contains many allusions to an otherwise undocumented sojourn in Venice. Shortly afterwards Terzio went to Vienna, where he joined the court of Ferdinand I, King of Hungary and Bohemia, later Holy Roman Emperor."
4839,"TESSIN, Nicodemus the Elder","(b. 1615, Stralsund, d. 1681, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tessin/elder/biograph.html,"
Swedish architect. He was born in Stralsund in Pomerania and came to Sweden as a young man. There he met and worked with the architect Simon de la Vallée (active c. 1633-1642 in Sweden). He worked for the Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna and was appointed court architect in 1649. Shortly after this he undertook a fairly long journey to see the major architectural works of Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands. The impressions he brought back with him were to be endlessly represented in his architecture."
4840,"TESSIN, Nicodemus the Younger","(b. 1654, Nyköping, d. 1728, Stockholm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tessin/younger/biograph.html,"
Swedish architect, son of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. He showed artistic talents at an early age and was given an education in mathematics and language at Uppsala. Like his father, he too had completed study tours throughout Europe. In Rome he had close connection with Bernini and Carlo Fontana, whose architecture had a decisive influence on his own creative output."
4841,"TESTA, Pietro","(b. 1611, Lucca, d. 1650, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/testa/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver and painter active in Rome. He trained with Domenichino and was employed by Nicolas Poussin's patron Cassiano dal Pozzo to make antiquarian drawings, but his bizarre imagination brings him closer in spirit to his more Romantic contemporaries such as Castiglione and Rosa. His paintings are rare and he is better known as an etcher. Testa died by drowning, and it was rumoured that he killed himself.

Gilles Testelin (1589 or 1592-1632), painter to Louis XIII, was the father of Louis Testelin (1615-1665) and Henri Testelin, both of whom studied painting with Simon Vouet and in 1648 were among the founders of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture."

4845,"TEYLER, Johannes","(b. 1648, Nijmegen, d. before 1709, Nijmegen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/teyler/biograph.html,"
Dutch etcher, engraver, draughtsman, inventor and professor of philosophy and mathematics. From 1679 he travelled in Italy, Egypt, the Holy Land and Malta, where he drew 'modern' fortifications. After a journey to Berlin in 1683, he probably settled in the province of Holland. The main subjects of his works were flowers, fruit and city views."
4846,"THAULOW, Fritz","(b. 1847, Oslo, d. 1906, Volendam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thaulow/biograph.html,"
Norwegian painter and engraver. Originally wanting to become a marine painter he studied at the art academy in Copenhagen (1870-73) as well as with the Danish marine specialist Carl Frederik Sørensen (1818-1879). He spent two winters at Karlsruhe (1873-74, 1874-5) as the pupil of Hans Gude (1825-1903) and then went to Paris, where he spent much of the period 1875-79. His marines and coastal pictures, some of which were accepted at the Paris Salon, were only moderately successful, but he acquired a fair knowledge of contemporary French Realist art and felt that Norwegian artists should learn from it. He admired in particular Jules Bastien-Lepage."
4847,THEOPHANES the Greek,"(b. ca. 1340, Constantinople, d. ca. 1410, ?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/theophan/biograph.html,"
Theophanes the Greek (in Russian Feofan Grek), painter from Constantinople, active mainly in Russia. He is said to have been a prolific decorator of churches, but only one fresco cycle survives that is certainly from his own hand, in the church of the Transfiguration at Novgorod (1378). This is one of the outstanding monuments of Russian medieval art, showing the highly personal version of the Byzantine style that Theophanes brought to Russia; his figures are vigorous and strongly characterized, and his brushwork has an almost impressionistic freedom and dash."
4848,THEOPHANES the Cretan,(active 1527-1559),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/theophax/biograph.html,"
Greek monk and painter. He worked mainly on Mt Athos, particularly at the monasteries of Lavra (c. 1535-40) and Stavronikita (1545-06), and also at Karyes, the administrative centre of Athos. His earliest known works are the wall paintings at the monastery of St Nicholas Anapafsas at Meteora (1527). Among his most outstanding works are the Massacre of the Innocents (Lavra), the Transfiguration (Lavra), the Last Supper (Stavronikita) and the Great Deësis (Karyes), which set an example for later painters of the Eastern Church. The most prominent representative of the Cretan school of wall painting in the 16th century, he had little Italian influence and preserved the traditions of the 15th-century Palaiologan and Cretan schools, thus helping to maintain a high standard of painting in Greek lands under Turkish rule.



"
4849,"THEOTOKOPOULOS, Jorge Manuel","(b. 1578, Toledo, d. 1631, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/theotoko/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and architect. He was trained by his father EL Greco, and it is practically impossible to distinguish their painting. Theotokopoulos is documented as a painter in 1603. The single signed work (c. 1595; Madrid, Prado), a copy of El Greco's Disrobing of Christ, shows him as a rather inept follower of his father, although his treatment of figures is much harder and more angular; they are almost caricatures. Of more interest is his altarpiece (1607-09) for the church of La Magdalena, Titulcia, Madrid."
4850,"THEVET, André","(b. 1516, Angoulême, d. 1592, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thevet/biograph.html,"
French cosmographer to the royal court. He was one of the great travelers of the sixteenth century, publishing illustrated accounts of trips to the Middle East and Brazil. On his travels he gathered portrait images of famous personages of history, which he published in 1584 in a luxurious edition with annotated biographies.



"
4851,"THIELE, Johann Alexander","(b. 1685, Erfurt, d. 1752, Dresden)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thiele/biograph.html,"
German Baroque painter and etcher. From 1729 he was court painter in Arnstadt, then from 1738 court painter in Dresden. He specialized in landscape painting. The invention of pastel has frequently been accredited to him, but the claim cannot be substantiated, as drawing in coloured chalks had been practiced long before. Thiele was perhaps the first to carry the art to perfection in Germany.



"
4852,"THIELEN, Jan Philip van","(b. 1618, Mechelen, d. 1667, Booischot)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thielen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter.  He was the son of a minor nobleman by the name of Liebrecht van Thielen. Jan Philip would eventually assume his father's title of Lord of Couwenberch. His mother was Anna Rigouts or Rigouldts. He signed some of his paintings with his mother's name."
4853,"THIENEN, Renier van",(active 1465-1498 in Brussels),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thienen/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. His first recorded commission was for a bronze lectern in the form of a pelican for the church of St James, Coudenbourg, in Brussels in 1465. The lost work probably resembled the bronze lectern sometimes attributed to van Thienen in the church of St Germain, Tirlemont. In 1468 van Thienen provided copper buttons for the coach of the Duchess of Burgundy, and three years later he delivered six bronze candlesticks (destroyed) for the Chambre de Comptes of Brussels. He was a respected Brussels citizen and held several civic offices in 1477-91."
4854,"THIERRY, Jean","(b. 1669, Lyon, d. 1739, Lyon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thierry/biograph.html,"
French sculptor, the son of a Lyonnaise sculptor, Jean Thierry. He moved to Paris as a young man with the support of Antoine Coysevox and Nicolas Coustou. He started working at Marly producing plaster casts after models for the marble groups. He was made an Academician in 1717. He was invited by Philip V of Spain to work with René Frémin on the palace of La Granja. He returned to Lyon at the end of his life.

Pieter Thijs (Thys), Flemish painter. In 1644-45 he became a master in Antwerp's Guild of St Luke and from c. 1647 worked for Archduke Leopold William in Brussels and the House of Orange in The Hague. He executed allegorical and mythological compositions for both courts and was also active as a portrait painter (e.g. Archduke Leopold William, Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum). Later in his career Thijs concentrated mainly on religious compositions for Antwerp monasteries and numerous churches in smaller towns and villages in Brabant and East Flanders (e.g. Sacrifice of Isaac, Antwerp, S Jacob). In addition, he painted mythological scenes and portrait commissions for individuals and the art trade in Antwerp."
4856,"THIRIOT, Jean","(b. ca. 1590, Vignot, d. 1647, Yerres)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thiriot/biograph.html,"
French architect and engineer. He came from a family of masons in Lorraine and settled in Paris. He worked on the châteaux of Chessy (Seine-et-Marne; 1614; destroyed), La-Grange-du-Milieu (Essonne; 1617), Bois-le-Vicomte (Seine-et-Marne; 1619; destroyed) and Chilly-Mazarin (Essonne; 1627-33; destroyed), the latter two to designs by Salomon de Brosse and Clément Métézeau II respectively. He collaborated with Métézeau on the construction of the dam (1627-28) across the harbour at the siege of La Rochelle. He was in charge of construction of the châteaux commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu from Jacques Lemercier at Rueil (from 1633; destroyed 1817) and Richelieu (from 1631; destroyed 1805), and the church of Sainte-Ursule de la Sorbonne, Paris (1635-59), as well as the Palais du Luxembourg (from 1615), commissioned from Salomon de Brosse by Marie de' Medici. In addition, he participated in the building of fortifications at Oléron and Brouage (Charente-Maritime)."
4857,"THIRY, Léonard","(active 1536, Fontainebleau, d. 1550, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thiry/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in France. He worked as Rosso Fiorentino's assistant in the Galerie François I at the château of Fontainebleau, and later under Francesco Primaticcio. It is impossible to identify his contribution to the paintings in the gallery, but he was active as a designer of prints in the 1540s. The Livre de la conqueste de la toison d'or engraved by René Boyvin (not published until 1563) is his most important work, but two sets of prints with twelve sheets each, etched by Léon Davent, are more interesting because the style is less strictly dependent on Rosso. One set represents the Story of Calypso, the other the Loves of Pluto and Proserpina, but the figures are small-scale, and the main interest is in the landscapes."
4858,"THIVAERT, Daniel Janszoon","(b. ca. 1613, Amsterdam, d. 1657, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thivaert/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam. This Italianate painter probably spent some of his productive years in Italy, enthralled by the Italian landscape. He was influenced by Leonaert Bramer and Willem de Poorter. He painted mythological and religious scenes, and a vanitas painting by him is also known.

German painter, printmaker and museum director. He was the son of a miller, craftsman and smallholder and studied briefly as a lithographer in Basel in 1854 before being apprenticed to a watchcase painter in Furtwangen. Returning home the same year, he started to draw and paint in his spare time. In 1859 he enrolled at the Kunstschule in Karlsruhe, where he studied until 1866 with Ludwig Des Coudres (1820-78) and the landscape painter Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863), by whom he was especially influenced."
4860,"THOMAS, Gabriel-Jules","(b. 1824, Paris, d. 1905, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thomas/biograph.html,"
French sculptor and painter. In 1841 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Augustin-Alexandre Dumont was one of his teachers. In 1848 he won the Prix de Rome in the sculpture category with his Philoctete partant pour le siege de Troie (""Philoctetes Leaves for the Siege of Troy"") in plaster. His marble statue of Virgil (Musée d'Orsay, Paris), executed after his return from Rome, shows his classicism."
4861,"THOMAS VAN YPEREN, Jan","(b. 1617, Antwerpen, d. 1678, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thomas_j/biograph.html,"

4862,"THOMASSIN, Philippe","(b. 1562, Troyes, d. 1622, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thomassi/biograph.html,"
French engraver and publisher. He was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Troyes in c. 1577. He emigrated to Rome where he is first documented in 1585. He initially worked for the French publishers Claude Duchet (Claudio Duchetti), Lorenzo Vaccari and Marcello Clodio. He subsequently collaborated with Antonio Tempesta on the Vita et miracula Divi Bernardi Clarevalensis Abbatis which was published in 1587."
4863,"THOMIRE, Pierre-Philippe","(b. 1751, Paris, d. 1843, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thomire/biograph.html,"
French bronze caster and sculptor. Although trained as a sculptor, Pierre-Philippe Thomire decided to follow his father into the potentially more lucrative profession of bronze caster, becoming the most important one of the late 18th century. Before setting up his own establishment in 1775, Thomire trained in the workshop of Pierre Gouthière."
4864,"THOMON, Thomas de","(b. 1754, Nancy, d. 1813, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thomon/biograph.html,"

He settled in Russia in the 1790s and was appointed court architect to Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1802. He remained in Russia until his death in 1813."
4865,"THON, Konstantin Andreyevich","(b. 1794, St. Petersburg, d. 1881, St. Petersburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thon/biograph.html,"
Russian architect. He studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1803-15) under the Empire Style architect Andrey Voronikhin, best remembered for his work on the Kazan Cathedral, situated right in the middle of the Nevsky Prospekt. He studied Italian art in Rome from 1819 to 1828, and on his return home was admitted to the academy as its member (1830) and professor (1833). In 1854, he was appointed rector of the architectural division of the academy."
4866,"THORNHILL, Sir James","(b. 1676, Melcombe Regis, d. 1734, Weymouth)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/thornhil/biograph.html,"
English decorative painter. He was the only British painter of his day successfully to emulate the European formulas for wall and ceiling painting and to challenge on their own ground the many foreign decorative painters then at work in England. His two finest works are the grisaille paintings on the Life of St Paul (1716-19) in the dome of the St Paul's Cathedral, London (he beat Pellegrini and Sebastiano Ricci in the competition for the commission), and the Painted Hall at Greenwich Hospital, on which he worked intermittently from 17708 to 1727. Thornhill was appointed History Painter to George I in 1718 and Serjeant-Painter in 1720, was knighted in 1722, and elected Member of Parliament in the same year. Hogarth was his son-in-law.

Danish sculptor, next to Canova the most celebrated sculptor of the Neoclassical movement. After five years at the Academy in his native Copenhagen, he reached Rome in 1797 on 3 March, a day which he henceforth considered as his birthday. He made his name with the statue Jason (Thorvaldsens Museum, Copenhagen, 1802-03), which was based on the Doryphoros of Polyclitus, and his growing reputation resulted in so many commissions that by 1820 he had forty assistants in his Roman workshop. In that year, when visiting Copenhagen, he began planning the decoration of the newly built church of Our Lady with marble statues and reliefs, a scheme which was to be his principal task for several years. His other major works include the tomb of Pius VII at St Peter's in Rome (1824-31) and a monument to Lord Byron (Trinity College, Cambridge, 1829)."

English patron, amateur architect. One of an able group of administrators associated with the Protestant cause during the minority of Edward VI, Thynne rose from comparatively humble origins to become steward to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. In this role he was responsible for supervising Somerset's many building projects and seems to have been fired by the enthusiasm for Classical architecture that was shared by other members of the same political circle."
4872,"TIARINI, Alessandro","(b. 1577, Bologna, d. 1668, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tiarini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and draughtsman. His mother died when he was a child, and he was raised by an aunt, and early on they tried, unsuccessfully to guide him towards becoming a cleric. He was the godson of painter Lavinia Fontana and initially apprenticed in Bologna under her father Prospero Fontana. After an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Carracci Academy, he studied for a brief period with Bartolommeo Cesi. Forced to flee from Bologna, due to a quarrel leading to the death of the other party, he moved to Florence, where he is documented between 1599 and 1606. In Florence he painted frescoes, façade decorations, and altarpieces including an Adoration of the Shepherds (Pitti Palace) which reveals a wide range of stylistic influences, not only from Tuscany but also from Venice and Bologna. He mainly worked under Domenico Passignano, but also Bernardino Poccetti and Jacopo da Empoli."
4873,"TIBALDI, Pellegrino","(b. 1527, Puria (Valsolda), d. 1596, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tibaldi/biograph.html,"
Italian Mannerist painter, part of a family of artists. His early paintings show the influence of Bagnacavallo and of other Bolognese followers of Raphael, but his actual teacher is unknown. Vasari's claim that his own works in S Michele in Bosco, Bologna, formed Tibaldi's artistic education is hardly borne out by the latter's first efforts. The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (c. 1545; Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale) is, in its classical, hierarchical simplicity, clearly inspired by Raphael's manner as interpreted by his Bolognese imitators; although it also bears delicate marks of Parmigianino's grace, the power of its expressive dignity and the architectural background hint at Tibaldi's future development. Tibaldi's Adoration of the Shepherds (c. 1546; Cento, Pinacoteca) shows an attempt at more elaborate composition, but its overtly Mannerist elements - perhaps derived from Vasari, as well as from Parmigianino - were not sufficiently digested to be fully integrated into the design."

Johannes Tielius (Jan Tilius), Dutch painter. He was on of the last of the 'fine' painters to emulate Gerrit Dou's delicate, porcelain-like brushwork. He was born in s-Hertogenbosch and worked in the 1690s in The Hague. His teacher may have been Pieter van Slingeland. He was probably also aware of the work of Adriaen van der Werff and Willem van Mieris. Tielius spent the last years of his life in London.

The greatest member of the family was Giambattista Tiepolo, the sixth and last child of Domenico Tiepolo, a merchant, and Orsetta, whose maiden name is not known. He was baptized Giovanni Battista after his godfather, Giovanni Battista Dorià, a Venetian nobleman, on 16 April 1696 in S Pietro di Castello, the family's local church and at that time the cathedral of Venice. Although their name belonged to one of the oldest and most distinguished of Venetian patrician families, this Tiepolo family did not claim noble lineage. However, perhaps through business connections, not only Giambattista but some of his siblings acquired highborn godparents. Domenico died about a year after Giambattista's birth, and it is possible that Orsetta brought up her children - all under ten at the time of their father's death - in straitened circumstances. In 1719 Giambattista married Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of the painters Giovanni Antonio and Francesco Guardi. Of their ten children, four daughters and three sons survived to adulthood. One of the sons, Giuseppe, entered the priesthood and the other two, Giandomenico Tiepolo and Lorenzo Tiepolo, became painters and assistants to their father.

A number of drawings (Würzburg, Wagner-Museum) has been attributed to him from these apprentice years. In 1753 the family returned to Venice."
4880,"TIETZ, Adam Ferdinand",(1708-1777),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tietz/biograph.html,"
Adam Ferdinand Tietz (also Dietz), Austrian sculptor. He first worked in the workshop of his father who was sculptor of Prince Lobkowitz. Later on, he most probably went to Vienna and was influenced by the work of the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Mattielli (c. 1682-1748), who supplied statuary for palaces and churches."
4881,"TIFFANY, Louis Comfort","(b. 1848, New York, d. 1933, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tiffany/biograph.html,"
American painter and designer, son of the famed jeweler Charles Lewis Tiffany. He is best remembered for his remarkable work with decorative iridescent glass. He began experimenting with stained glass in 1875, and co-founded a glass-making company in New York City in 1878. When disagreements between Tiffany and his partners caused the business to close in the mid-1880s, Tiffany started his own firm (later named Tiffany Studios). In the early 1890s, he created a type of glass known for its iridescent colouring, called ""Favrile,"" helping him secure his status as a world leader in glass production. He died in New York City in 1933.

4882,"TILBORGH, Gillis van","(b. ca. 1625, Bruxelles, d. ca. 1678, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tilborgh/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He is said to have learnt to paint from his father, then studied with David Teniers the Younger. In 1654 he became a member of the painters' guild in Brussels, and from then ran a busy studio, although few of his pupils can be identified. His paintings are mostly signed with the monogram TB and dated between 1650 and 1671. He painted genre scenes of peasant life, such as kermesse and tavern scenes, in the manner of his master and of Joos van Craesbeeck. Van Tilborgh's use of colour is lively, with reds and blues reminiscent of Teniers."
4883,"TILGNER, Victor Oskar","(b. 1844, Pressburg, d. 1896, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tilgner/biograph.html,"
Austrian sculptor. He was born in Pressburg (now Bratislava), but the family moved to Vienna when he was a child. His talent was recognized early by the sculptor Franz Schönthaler (1821-1904), who became his first teacher. Then, at the Academy of Fine Arts, he studied under Franz Bauer (1798-1872) and Josef Gasser (1816-1900). Later, he was attracted to engraving and worked with the medalist Joseph Daniel Böhm (1794-1865)."
4884,"TILLEMANS, Peter","(b. ca. 1684, Antwerpen, d. 1734, Norton)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tilleman/biograph.html,"
English painter of Flemish birth. Trained in the Netherlands, Tillemans and his brother-in-law, Peter Casteels, went to England in 1708 to work for a picture dealer named Turner as copyists of Old Master paintings. He did well copying landscapes and made his own compositions. By 1711 he seems to have established his own painting practice and in that year became a founder-member of the Great Queen Street Academy, where he declared his speciality as 'landskip'. From 1708 until his death he lived and worked in England. Alongside John Wootton and James Seymour, he was one of the founders of the English school of sporting painting.



"
4885,"TILLOT, Charles Victor","(b. 1825, Rouen, d. 1895, Rouen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tillot/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon of 1846. From 1851 he was also an art critic. He bought a house in Barbizon in 1860 and studied with Millet and Théodore Rousseau. He became friend of Degas and the Rouart brothers, and collected Japanese prints. Between 1876 and 1886 he exhibited at all the Impressionist exhibitions except the 1st and the 7th, mainly landscapes and sea scenes in the style of the Barbizon school.


"
4886,TINO DA CAMAINO,"(b. ca. 1285, Siena, d. ca. 1337, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tino/biograph.html,"
Sienese Sculptor, chiefly of tombs, active in Pisa, Florence, and Naples, as well as his native city. He probably trained with Giovanni Pisano, but his style was more calm and reserved, with an imposing block-like massiveness. His early career was spent in Pisa and Siena, but his chief works are in Florence (where he worked 1321-24) and Naples (where he worked from 1324 until his death). In Florence his work included the tomb of Bishop Orso in the cathedral - possibly the earliest example of the seated effigy. In Naples, where he is known to have been in touch with Giotto, who was court painter there at the time, and with the Sienese painter Pietro Lorenzetti, his work included tabernacled tombs for the Angevin court (e.g. for Queen Mary of Hungary in Santa Maria Donnaregina). He somewhat modified his own rigorous style in the direction of the more decorative grace of the Gothic style, but none the less his influence was significant as one of the Tuscan artists who carried the new northern developments to the southern parts of Italy.



"
4887,"TINTORE, Simone del","(b. 1630, Lucca, d. 1708, Lucca)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tintore/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He trained at the painting academy opened in Lucca by Pietro Paolini in the mid-17th century and was acknowledged to be an excellent painter of still-lifes. He bequeathed to his third wife, Caterina del Testore, 13 paintings, almost all of them of religious subjects, which may represent evidence of a still unknown aspect of Simone's painting. There are numerous records of still-lifes by him in collections in Lucca: fruit, fungi, flowers, animals, fish and kitchens are among the most common subjects."
4888,TINTORETTO,"(b. 1518, Venezia, d. 1594, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tintoret/biograph.html,"Venetian painter, originally named Jacopo Robusti. His nickname derives from his father's profession of dyer (tintore). Although he was prolific and with Veronese the most successful Venetian painter in the generation after Titian's death, little is known of his life. He is said to have trained very briefly with Titian, but the style of his immature works suggests that he may also have studied with Bonifacio Veronese, Paris Bordone, or Schiavone. Almost all of his life was spent in Venice and most of his work is still in the churches or other buildings for which it was painted. He appears to have been unpopular because he was unscrupulous in procuring commissions and ready to undercut his competitors. By 1539 he was working independently, but the little that is known of his early work suggests that he was not precocious.

German painter and architect. First recorded in Augsburg in 1531, marrying the daughter of Jörg Breu the Elder, he became a master painter in 1532. He collaborated on work, including murals at the Weberhaus, Augsburg, with his father-in-law and the latter's son, Jörg Breu the Younger (c. 1510-1547), developing no separate artistic identity. In 1542 he was appointed to the Augsburg building committee, and afterwards he worked almost exclusively as an architect and commissioner of art."
4891,"TIRONI, Francesco","(b. ca. 1745, Venezia, d. 1797, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tironi/biograph.html,"

German painter and graphic artist, part of a family of artists, the nephew of Johann Heinrich Tischbein I. He painted landscapes and animals, and after a longer stay in Holland he settled down in Kassel, where in 1775 he became inspector of the gallery there especially famous for its Netherlandish paintings. He loved the hunt almost  passionately and practiced it besides his art for relaxation and amusement. His hunting scenes were praised by connoisseurs.

James (originally Jacques Joseph) Tissot, French painter, printmaker and enamellist. He grew up in a port, an experience reflected in his later paintings set on board ship. He moved to Paris c. 1856 and became a pupil of Louis Lamothe and Hippolyte Flandrin. He made his Salon début in 1859 and continued to exhibit there successfully until he went to London in 1871."
4897,"TITO, Santi","(b. 1536, Sansepolcro, d. 1602, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tito/santi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, draughtsman and architect. His art is of fundamental importance to the history of Florentine painting in the transitional period between Mannerism and Baroque. He rejected the virtuosity of Mannerist painters and returned to an earlier Renaissance tradition that emphasized clear narrative and the expression of a purer, more genuine religious sentiment. His most important works are altarpieces and frescoes; his private commissions included devotional paintings, mythological scenes and portraits. Although he was less important as an architect, here too he upheld an ideal of purity and simplicity that parallels the style of his paintings."
4898,"TITO, Tiberio di","(b. 1578, Firenze, d. 1637, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tito/tiberio/biograph.html,"

4899,"TIVOLI, Serafino de","(b. 1826, Livorno, d. 1892, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tivoli/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. After initial study of Literature at a religious private school in Florence, he began his artistic training under Károly Markó the Elder. He met Vito D'Ancona during the mid-1840s, and joined him in painting landscapes en plein air. In 1848 he fought as a Tuscan volunteer for Garibaldi in the Risorgimento. In 1855 his paintings, exhibited at the Florentine Promotrice exhibition, brought him to the attention of the artists who frequented the Caffè Michelangiolo in Florence (including those who would later become known as the Macchiaioli). In that same year he traveled to Paris, where he was greatly impressed by the paintings of the Barbizon school. He saw in their realism and powerful chiaroscuro a means of renewing art in the modern age. Upon his return to Florence he conveyed this new enthusiasm to his friends, who quickly adopted his ideas. In recognition of the influence he had on his fellow Florentine artists, Telemaco Signorini called him ""the father of the macchia""."
4900,TIZIANO Vecellio,"(b. 1490, Pieve di Cadore, d. 1576, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tiziano/biograph.html,"The greatest painter of the Venetian School. The evidence for his birthdate is contradictory, but he was certainly very old when he died. He was probably a pupil of Giovanni Bellini, and in his early work he came under the spell of Giorgione, with whom he had a close relationship. In 1508 he assisted him with the external fresco decoration of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, Venice, and after Giorgione's early death in 1510 it fell to Titian to complete a number of his unfinished paintings. The authorship of certain works (some of them famous) is still disputed between them.

French portrait painter who was the pupil and son-in-law of Nattier (who was good at painting pretty women, while Tocqué was happier with plain ones). He admired Rigaud and Largillierre and adapted their styles, and Nattier's, to the requirements of his own time. He worked in Paris except for a trip to St Petersburg and Copenhagen (1756-59) and a second trip to Copenhagen in 1769.

Lodewijk Toeput (Lodovico Pozzoserrato, Pozzo da Treviso), Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. He was apparently a pupil of Marten de Vos and went to Italy probably after 1573. In Venice he presumably joined Tintoretto's workshop. Toeput may have witnessed the event he commemorated in his Fire in the Doge's Palace (1577; Treviso, Museo Civico Bailo). Either before or after this commission, he made six landscape frescoes (c. 1575 or 1577-79) for the abbey of Praglia, which reveal a strong adherence to Flemish conventions. Some years later he painted three frescoes in the church of S Giustina in Padua. He was in Florence in the late 1570s and visited Rome in 1581; by February 1582 he is documented in Treviso, near Venice, where he settled."

Russian sculptor, medallist, painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He came from a distinguished family, and in 1802 he finished his studies in the Naval Cadet Corps in St Petersburg. In the same year he entered the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg as an occasional student and soon began a career as a professional artist. Most surviving examples of his early work are wax reliefs, such as the portrait of I. I. Golovin (c. 1805-10; St Petersburg, Russian Museum) and the Self-portrait with Family (1812; Moscow, Tretyakov Gallery), and drawings."
4906,"TOMA, Gioacchino","(b. 1836, Galatina, d. 1891, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/toma/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He was orphaned at the age of six and spent an unhappy childhood and adolescence in convents and poorhouses; these experiences would later provide subjects for his paintings. He was first taught drawing at the art school in the hospice for the poor in the Adriatic town of Giovinazzo, but in 1855 he moved to Naples, where he worked for an ornamental painter named Alessandro Fergola. In 1857 he was mistakenly arrested for conspiracy and exiled to Piedimonte d'Alife, 60 km from Naples, where he was initiated into the secret society of the Carbonari by some local liberal aristocrats who also became his first patrons. His paintings for them were mainly still-lifes, largely in the traditional Neapolitan style."
4907,"TOMÉ, Narciso","(b. 1694, Toro, d. 1742, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tome/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect, sculptor and painter. He came from a family of architects and sculptors, which included his father Antonio Tomé (1664-1730) and his two brothers, Andrés Tomé (1688-1761) and Diego Tomé (1696-1732). The family was active in Castile at the beginning of the 18th century; they are first recorded in 1715 as sculptors of the portal of the Universidad de Valladolid, in which a giant order, crowned with statues, dominates the plain façade. The Tomé family was called to Toledo in 1720 to work on the Transparente of the 13th-century cathedral; Narciso appears to have designed the work before his departure on 6 June 1721, when the contract for its execution was issued. He returned to Toledo on 27 October 1721 and was appointed Maestro Mayor of the cathedral. Work was completed by 9 June 1732, when the altar was consecrated."

At the end of the 1870s, at the Tommasi's estate at Bellariva, he got to know Silvestro Lega, who taught Adolfo's younger cousins Angiolo and Ludovico and spent a great deal of time with the Tommasi family."
4909,TOMMASO DA MODENA,(c. 1325-1379),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tommaso/biograph.html,"Italian painter, one of the leading artists of his day in northern Italy. His earthy, humane, and naturalistic style is well seen in his series of frescos of famous Dominicans (signed and dated 1352) in the Chapter House of S. Niccolò in Treviso. The saintly figures are shown meditating, writing, and reading (the first dated example of spectacles being worn appears here) and Tommaso shows a remarkable ability to depict intellectual activity. His reputation was such that work was commissioned from him by the emperor Charles IV in Bohemia, and two panels by Tommaso are still in Karlstein Castle, near Prague. It is unlikely that he visited Bohemia, but there is some kinship between his work and that of his leading Bohemian contemporary, Master Theoderic.

Swiss painter, caricaturist and engraver. He trained as an engraver in Lausanne and while there illustrated Horace-Bénédict de Saussure's Voyage dans les Alpes (Geneva, 1779) in 1786. He studied under Joseph-Benoit Suvée in Paris (1789-91) and was influenced by Jean-Louis Demarne. On his return to Geneva Töpffer went on painting expeditions with Pierre-Louis De La Rive; these studies of the environs of the city inspired his best work. In 1796 he exhibited caricatures at the Salon in Geneva and from 1804 to 1807 was in Paris, where he was Drawing Master to Josephine Bonaparte. From 1810 he concentrated on painting such scenes from local village life as Open-air Sermon (c. 1810; Geneva, Musée Rath). His anecdotal, animated landscapes were very popular not only in Switzerland but also in France, where he exhibited at the Salons of 1804 and 1812 in Paris. He won a gold medal at the latter Salon for the contemporary history painting Re-establishment of Religion in France after the Revolution (1811; Geneva, Musée d'Art et d'Histoire), a subject he had first treated in 1803 (versions, Geneva, Musée Rath; Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts)."

Italian painter, called Il Moro. According to Vasari he was taught by Giorgione. He moved from Venice to Verona around 1500 and was certainly trained in the workshop of Liberale da Verona. In 1514 he is recorded as living with the noble Giusti family in Verona. The Portrait of a Young Man with a Rose (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), signed and dated 1516, displays a soft finish and dreamy countenance, and the Portrait of a Man and Woman (private collection) has similar Giorgionesque qualities. The signed Portrait of a Man (c. 1520; Milan, Brera) is more tightly painted, recalling Lorenzo Lotto rather than Giorgione. In the Virgin and Child with Five Saints (c. 1520; Verona, San Zeno) the more finished forms, bright colour and twisting poses reveal an interest in Mannerism; the same characteristics are evident in the altarpiece depicting the Virgin in Glory with the Archangel Raphael and St Giustina (1523; Verona, San Fermo)."

Spanish painter. He trained in Seville in the workshop of Juan de Valdés Leal. He probably began to paint c. 1680 yet, despite a long career, very little of his work is known. He must have been known at the court in Madrid, as he is documented there in 1724 and was a friend of the writer and Painter to the King, Antonio Palomino y Velasco.

The first works in marble ascribed to him, such as the altar of the Pietà (Udine, Monte di Pietà) and the altar (Nimis, Udine) made for San Silvestro, Venice, reveal the influence of Arrigo Merengo (Heinrich Meyring). The Holy Family in the church of the Scalzi, Venice, which may be placed among his earliest works, also shows elements of Marengo's style, but Torretti soon moved towards the more classical art of Pietro Baratta."
4923,"TORRICELLI, Giuseppe Antonio","(b. 1659, Firenze, d. 1719, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/torricel/biograph.html,"
Italian craftsman. He came from a dynasty of artisans who had been active for some time in the Medici workshop in Florence; an ancestor called Bartolomeo is mentioned among the craftsmen employed at the Cappella dei Principi, Florence, during the reign of Ferdinand I. According to a manuscript (1739; Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale) by his contemporary, the collector Francesco Maria Nicolò Gabburri, Torricelli studied drawing with Alessandro Rosi (1627-1707) and modelling with Gaetano Zumbo (1656-1701) and was employed by Cosimo III at the Grand Ducal workshop to carve cameos and reliefs. The cameos he created include one of the elderly Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere (London, Victoria and Albert Museum) and another, unusually large, of Cosimo III and Tuscany in front of the Temple of Peace (chalcedony, Florence, Museo dell'Opificio delle Pietre Dure).



"
4924,"TORRIGIANO, Pietro","(b. 1472, Firenze, d. 1528, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/torrigi/biograph.html,"
Torrigiano was a Florentine sculptor, who, in youth, studied under Bertoldo di Giovanni and in a fight broke the nose of Michelangelo and for this has been hated by all Florentines ever since. He was a brilliant and versatile sculptor and also one of the first Italian Renaissance artists to work in France, the Netherlands, Spain and perhaps Portugal. He was in the Netherlands 1509-10. He worked in England 1511-18 on the Tombs of Lady Margaret Beaufort, Elisabeth of York and Henry VII in Westminster Abbey, the latter being his masterpiece. He introduced the pure Renaissance style into England. He went to Seville in 1522. There according to Vasari (who also hated him for breaking Michelangelo's nose), he fell into the hands of the Inquisition and starved himself to death from sheer spleen.



"
4925,"TORRIGIANI, Sebastiano",(active 1573-1596),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/torrigia/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, born in Bologna, a skilful caster of bronzes. He was active in the Roman workshop of Guglielmo della Porta after 1573, and assumed control of the studio after della Porta's death in 1577. He executed bronze sculptures for the Cappella Gregoriana in St Peter's, the Cappella del Presepio in Santa Maria Maggiore, both in Rome, and the Capella del Coro in Sant'Agostino in Bologna. His best-known works are the colossal bronze figures (1585–87) of St Peter and St Paul by Tomaso della Porta, cast for the tops of the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Torrigiani was also responsible for the metal screen in the Sistine Chapel. Perhaps Torrigiani's greatest contribution was in portraiture, notable examples being a bust of Gregory XIII and three busts of Sixtus V.



"
4926,"TORRITI, Jacopo",(active c. 1270-1300),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/torriti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and mosaicist. Nothing is known of his life. Two mosaics in Rome are signed by him: one, on the apse of S. Giovanni in Laterano, that once bore the date 1291 (or, according to some sources, 1290 or 1292); and another on the apse and triumphal arch of S. Maria Maggiore, now replaced by a 19th-century restoration but at one time dated 1295 or 1296. Torriti is also known to have executed a mosaic for Arnolfo di Cambio’s tomb of Pope Boniface VIII (1296; destroyed) in Old St Peter’s, Rome. Torriti was active during the same period as Cimabue and Giotto, Pietro Cavallini and Arnolfo di Cambio, but his fame has been obscured by theirs, no doubt because of his closer links with Byzantine art. He was nevertheless one of the most important artists working in Rome during the papacy of Nicholas IV (1288–92) and was entrusted with some of the most prestigious commissions of the day. He recaptures something of the vitality of late antique mosaics; he was clearly influenced in his choice of colour by the pale delicate harmonies and silvery lights of the 5th-century mosaic on the triumphal arch  of the S. Maria Maggiore. A small series of frescoes in the Upper Church of San Francesco, Assisi, has been attributed to him on stylistic grounds.



"
4927,"TOSCANI, Giovanni di Francesco","(b. ca. 1370, Firenze, d. 1430, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/toscani/biograph.html,"
Giovanni di Francesco Toscani (also Tossicani), Italian painter. He matriculated in the Florentine Compagnia di San Luca in 1424, but it seems that already in 1420 he was inscribed on the rolls of the company.
The name Giovanni di Francesco was virtually unknown in art historical literature until 1917, when a scholar discovered documents from 1458 and 1459 linking Giovanni to payments for a fresco lunette. This lunette, in the Loggia degli Innocenti in Florence, remains his only documented painting."
4928,"TOSINI, Michele","(b. 1503, Firenze, d. 1577, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tosini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, known as Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio. He studied with Lorenzo di Credi and Antonio del Ceraiolo (fl 1520-38) before entering the workshop of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. By 1525 he was frequently collaborating with Ghirlandaio, and their closeness is reflected in Tosini's adopted name."
4929,"TOULMOUCHE, Auguste","(b. 1829, Nantes, d. 1890, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/toulmouc/biograph.html,"
French painter. Toulmouche was a successful genre painter who briefly mentored the young Monet. He exhibited his work at the Salon from 1848 onwards, receiving numerous accolades, including a silver medal at the Salon of 1861 and a bronze medal at the 1878 Universal Exposition. In 1870 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. "
4930,"TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de","(b. 1864, Albi, d. 1901, Château Malromé, Langon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/toulouse/biograph.html,"
French painter and lithographer. He was the son of a wealthy nobleman, a direct descendant of the counts of Toulouse. His eccentric father lived in provincial luxury, hunting with falcons and collecting exotic weapons."
4931,"TOURNIER, Nicolas","(b. 1590, ?, d. ca. 1638, Toulouse)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tournier/biograph.html,"
French painter. Very little is known of his life and most of the attributions to him are speculative, but he seems to have been - with the exception of Georges de La Tour - the most individual and sensitive of French Caravaggesque painters."
4932,"TOURNIÈRES, Robert","(b. 1667, Caen, d. 1752, Caen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tournies/biograph.html,"
French painter. He began his artistic training with the Carmelite Lucas Delahaye, but a decisive influence on his future development was meeting Bon Boullogne, whom Tournières accommodated in his studio in Paris. There Tournières made copies of paintings of the Dutch School. He also worked as a copyist in the studio of France's most successful contemporary portrait painter, Hyacinthe Rigaud.


"
4933,"TOUSSAINT, François Christophe Armand","(b. 1806, Paris, d. 1862, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/toussain/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. He studied under David d'Angers at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris following his admission in 1827 at the age of 21. A skilled sculptor, he received the Grand Prix de Rome four years later with a figure titled Capanée foudroyé sous les murs de Thebes. He exhibited at the Salon between 1836 and 1850, winning a third-class medal in 1839 for his Jésus Christ environné de petits enfants and a second class in 1847 for his Une esclave indienne portant une torche."
4934,"TOVAR, Alonso Miguel de","(b. 1678, Higuera de la Sierra, d. 1758, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tovar/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He trained in Seville under Juan Antonio Ossorio and executed numerous religious paintings, including Our Lady of Consolation with SS Francis, James and a Clerical Donor (1720; Seville Cathedral) and St Francis Receiving the Stigmata (c. 1720; Museo de la Real Academia de San Fernando, Madrid). In both of these the influence of Murillo is discernible: the colouring is vivid and the drawing precise, if slightly rigid, and both works show a gentle and uncomplicated piety."
4935,"TRABALLESI, Bartolomeo","(b. ca. 1540, Firenze, d. 1585, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traball/bartolom/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, active in Florence in a Mannerist style. Although little is known about his personal circumstances, it seems that he was a pupil of Michele Tosini and his brother, Francesco, was also an artist. Furthermore, his contribution to the decoration of the studiolo of Francesco I in the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence (completed 1570-1572) may suggest that he was also a pupil of Giorgio Vasari who supervised the project. For the studiolo, Traballesi painted his dramatic interpretation of the Greek mythological story of Danaë's impregnation by Zeus who comes to her in the form of golden rain."
4936,"TRABALLESI, Francesco","(b. 1544, Firenze, d. 1588, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traball/francesc/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, sculptor and architect. He was active in Rome during the papacy of Pope Gregory XIII (1572-1585). In the Roman church of Sant'Atanasio dei Greci, which was founded by Gregory, there are two altarpieces by Traballesi, an Annunciation, and a Christ among the Doctors, while in the Greek Pontifical College of Saint Athanasius, next to the church, are more of his paintings, with Apostles, Fathers of the Church, and a Crucifixion, which were once parts of the iconostasis of the church itself. In the Town Hall of Tivoli, anciently called Tibur in Latium, are two frescoes painted by Traballesi in 1574, showing scenes of The Mythic Foundation of Tibur."
4937,"TRABALLESI, Giuliano","(b. 1727, Firenze, d. 1812, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traballe/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and engraver. He trained in Florence with Agostino Veracini (1689-1762) and Francesco Conti (1681-1760), and studied architecture and stage design under Antonio Galli-Bibiena. His earliest known painting is a fresco of 1758: Heavenly Father in Glory in the Dominican church in Livorno. He enriched his art by the study of Correggio's works in Parma, and also those of Bolognese painters, making engravings (1764-67) after paintings by Guido Reni, Agostino Carracci, Annibale Carracci, Guercino and others. These were praised in 1765 by Pierre-Jean Mariette and were later collected in an album entitled Venticinque quadri ai maestri eccellenti incisi da Giuliano Traballesi (Milan, 1796)."
4938,"TRAINI, Francesco",(active 1321-1363),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traini/biograph.html,"
Pisan painter. Only one work is certainly known to be by him: the signed polyptych of St Dominic and Scenes from his Life (Muso Nazionale, Pisa). The most important works attributed to him are frescoes in the Campo Santo in Pisa: the celebrated Triumph of Death, with accompanying scenes of the Last Judgment, Hell, and Legends of the Hermits. These, among the outstanding Italian paintings of the 14th century, were badly damaged by bombs in the Second World War, but this brought to light, by way of partial compensation, the beautiful ""sinopie"", which are now shown in the Museo delle Sinopie. The frescoes include many telling details of death's victims and are usually seen as a reflection of the horrors of the black death of 1348. However, since the essay by Luciano Bellosi in 1974 these frescoes are considered the work of Buonamico Buffalmacco.


"
4939,"TRAMELLO, Alessio","(b. ca. 1455, Borgonovo Val Tidone, d. ca. 1528, Piacenza)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tramello/biograph.html,"
Italian architect. He may have trained under Giovanni di Domenico Battaggio, whose style was derived from Donato Bramante; Tramello's own monumental works belong to the same school. Two of his most impressive and original buildings are the Benedictine church of San Sisto (1499-1511) and the Olivetan monastery of San Sepolcro (1513-34), both in Piacenza and both erected by Tramello to his own designs."
4940,"TRAUT, Hans",(active 1477-1516 in Nuremberg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traut/hans/biograph.html,"
German painter and draftsman. He originated in the Middle Rhine region and became a citizen of Nuremberg in 1477. There he was responsible for the decorative scheme of the Augustinian convent, and his major work, the Augustinian Altarpiece, dated 1487, is today in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg.

His son, Wolf Traut was also a painter and designer of woodcuts.



"
4941,"TRAUT, Wolf","(b. ca. 1485, Nürnberg, d. 1520, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traut/wolf/biograph.html,"
German painter, designer of woodcuts and glass paintings. He apprenticed to his father, Hans Traut, a native of Speyer who became a citizen of Nuremberg in 1477. The earliest woodcuts to be firmly attributed to him were for Ulrich Pinder's 'Der beschlossen Gart des Rosenkranz Maria' of 1505, which he must have made while in the workshop of Albrecht Dürer; and he was probably also an assistant of Hans von Kulmbach. From 1512 to 1513, Dürer employed him to make woodcuts for his Triumphal Arch. His most important painting, the Artelshofener altarpiece, signed and dated 1514, and originally in the Lorenzkirche, Nuremberg, is now in Munich (Bayerisches Nationalmuseum)."
4942,"TRAUTMANN, Johann Georg","(b. 1713, Zweibrücken, d. 1769, Frankfurt am Main)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trautman/biograph.html,"
German painter and etcher. He was a student of Ferdinand Bellon in Zweibrücken and, in Frankfurt, he studied with Hugo Schlegel (1679-1737) and Gabriel Kiesewetter (1711-1753). In 1761, he was named painter to the court of the Elector Palatine. Trautmann was known especially for his paintings of night scenes lit by fires. Among his works are images of musicians - a bagpiper, a lutenist, a family of singers, and a family of musicians. There are also genre scenes of an inn, soldiers playing cards, or a peasant family at table. Trautmann also painted portraits. Though he is said to have been an etcher, only six etchings by Trautmann are mentioned.



"
4943,"TRAVERSI, Gaspare","(b. ca. 1722, Naples, d. 1770, Rome)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/traversi/biograph.html,"
At the end of the Baroque era, eighteenth-century Neapolitan art produced a whole batch of interesting artists, of whom one stands out above the crowd: Gaspare Traversi. For a long time he has remained unknown, or at least very little known and then mainly for his religious paintings. (Although they were certainly better than average, especially the Parma altarpieces the Bourbons commissioned from him, they are not very original.)"
4944,"TRAVI, Antonio","(b. 1608, Sestri Ponente, d. 1665, Sestri Ponente)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/travi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher. He worked with Bernardo Strozzi, first as a servant grinding colours and then as a pupil who, like Giovanni Andrea de' Ferrari, copied Strozzi's work in the early 1620s. However, whereas Ferrari was a figure painter, Travi is best known for his landscapes. This expertise is thought to have been acquired from Strozzi's friend the landscape painter Goffredo Wals, whose presence in Genoa is documented in 1623. Wals's delicately painted, circular landscapes with small figures may have stimulated Travi but, before turning to landscapes, the latter aspired to paint large figured compositions, for example his Marriage of St Catherine (1629; Sestri Ponente parish church) in the manner of Strozzi and Ansaldo. Another large figure composition, the Adoration of the Shepherds (c. 1630; Genoa, Palazzo Bianco), shows figures more in keeping with those inhabiting his landscapes; they derive from Sinibaldo Scorza and Cornelis de Wael and emphasize Travi's study under Strozzi, whose own interest in north European art is visible in his treatment of the same subject (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum)."
4945,"TRECK, Jan Jansz.","(b. ca. 1606, Amsterdam, d. 1652, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/treck/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, pupil of his brother-in-law, Jan Jansz. van den Uyl (1595/6-1639/40). After Van den Uyl's sudden death in 1640, he acted as guardian of his children and executor of his estate. He specialized in still-lifes and was much influenced by the style of Uyl, Claesz and Heda. Works by the artist are rare; Vroom records just fifteen autograph pictures with dated works between 1644 and 1651 indicating a fairly brief period of activity.



"
4946,"TREMIGNON, Alessandro","(b. 1635, Padova, d. 1711, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tremigno/biograph.html,"
Italian architect from Padua, active in Venice, where he designed several buildings. His works comprise, among others, the façade of the church San Moise (1668), the Palazzo Labia (c. 1700). The altar in the cathedral Santa Maria Assunta in Chioggia is also attributed to him.



"
4947,"TRÉMOLIÈRES, Pierre-Charles","(b. 1703, Cholet, d. 1739, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tremolie/biograph.html,"
French painter, draughtsman and etcher. In 1719 he began apprenticeship in the Paris studio of Jean-Baptiste van Loo, and thanks to family connections he soon made contact with the influential patron the Comte de Caylus, in whose house he lodged. One of his first commissions was to etch two sets of three plates (1726 and 1728) after drawings by Antoine Watteau for the collection of prints Figures de différents caractères de paysages et d'études ..., published by Jean de Jullienne in 1726. Trémolières also attended drawing lessons at the Académie Royale, and in 1726 and again in 1727 he gained second prize in the Prix de Rome competition. In 1728 he went to complete his artistic education at the Académie de France in Rome with Pierre Subleyras and Louis-Gabriel Blanchet."
4948,"TRETSCH, Aberlin","(b. 1510, Stuttgart, d. ca. 1578, Stuttgart)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tretsch/biograph.html,"
German architect. A bondsman and the son of a poor family, he was self-taught and became adviser to the Dukes of Württemberg on artistic and technical matters. He knew none of the Mediterranean languages but had trained his eye by looking at the architecture of foreign courts. In 1568, with Georg Gadner, a privy councilor, he drew up a set of building regulations for Württemberg. From 1537 he was in the service of Duke Ulrich VI of Württemberg (reg 1537-50) and from 1550 in that of Duke Christopher (reg 1550-68); after the latter's death Tretsch spent the last years of his own life working for Duke Ludwig VI (reg 1568-93)."
4949,"TREVISANI, Francesco","(b. 1656, Capodistria, d. 1746, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trevisan/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He painted altarpieces and cabinet paintings of biblical and mythological themes in a style that varies between the classicism of Maratti and the softer, sweeter manner of the Barocchetto. His portraits, both of noble Italian patrons and visiting Grand Tourists, are distinguished by their unusual informality and the sense of intimacy between artist and subject.



"
4950,"TREZZO, Jacopo da","(b. ca. 1515, Trezzo, d. 1589, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trezzo/biograph.html,"
Italian medallist, sculptor, gem-engraver and jeweller. Nothing is known of his background and early life. His family apparently came from Trezzo sull'Adda but were living in Milan at the time of his birth. By 1550 he had achieved a level of fame that deserved mention in the first edition of Vasari's Vite. His activities in Milan, in which city he lived until 1555, included gem-engraving and the fabrication of objects in precious and semi-precious stones for Cosimo I, Duke of Florence."
4951,"TRIBOLO, Niccolo","(b. 1500, Firenze, d. 1558, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tribolo/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, engineer and garden designer (originally Niccolò di Raffaello de' Pericoli, called Il Tribolo). He was apprenticed in Florence first as a wood-carver with Giovanni d'Alesso d'Antonio and then as a sculptor with Jacopo Sansovino, whom he continued to assist well into the second decade of the 16th century. Vasari listed many works (most now untraced) from Tribolo's youth, among which was his earliest fountain; an old terracotta copy (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) shows this unpretentious and slightly old-fashioned work to have featured two children and a spouting dolphin that foreshadow the blithe charm of his later masterpieces."
4952,"TRICHT, Arnt van","(active c. 1530; d. 1570, Kalkar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tricht/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish sculptor and wood-carver. He established himself as a sculptor in Kalkar c. 1530, succeeding Hendrick Douverman, by whom he was probably trained. In the first half of the sixteenth century a circle of sculptors that included Hendrick Douverman, Heinrich van Holt, and Arnt van Tricht was active in Kalkar, a town in the Lower Rhine region of Germany near the Dutch border (near Kleve)."
4953,"TRINQUESSE, Louis-Rolland","(b. 1745, Paris, d. ca. 1800)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trinques/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a student at the Académie Royale from 1758 to at least 1770 and worked both as a portrait painter and a genre painter. His portraits are usually gentle and uncomplicated likenesses painted in pastel colours, for example the Young Girl (1777; Paris, Louvre). When dealing with older male sitters, however, his style could be grander and more sober, as in the portrait of the Abbé Gentil (1783; Bagnols-sur-Cèze, Musées Bagnols-sur-Cèze) and the Portrait of an Architect (formerly identified as Jacques-Denis Antoine; 1780; private collection), the most ambitious of Trinquesse's known works, showing the architect as if measuring a drawing."
4954,"TRIPPEL, Alexander","(b. 1744, Schaffhausen, d. 1793, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trippel/biograph.html,"Sculptor of Swiss origin, but he moved with his family to London when he was ten. In 1763 he moved on to the Copenhagen academy of art. Numerous changes of base followed - Copenhagen, Berlin, Paris, Switzerland and Rome - until he finally settled in Rome. When the news of the death of Frederick the Great reached him there in 1786, Trippel designed a wax model of a memorial to the king, while Schadow was doing just the same in his workshop. Both works was conceived as equestrian statues modeled more or less on the statue of Marcus Aurelius. Trippel's design was clearly more interesting, because, though it did not get him the commission, it gained him honorary membership of the Prussian Academy of Arts. In his model, the notion first appears of adding sculptures of the nation's leading figures to the base of the equestrian statue. The idea would be put into practice almost 600 years later in Rauch's memorial.

"
4955,"TRISTÁN DE ESCAMILLA, Luis","(b. 1586, Toledo, d. 1624, Toledo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tristan/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter, active mainly in Toledo. He was born into a family of craftsmen. His father died when he was young, and some years later his mother, Ana de Escamilla, leased an inn in Toledo. He had several brothers, one of whom, Baltasar, was a Dominican friar and another (who called himself 'de Acevedo') was a landscape painter whose work is unknown. Around 1603 Tristán entered the workshop of El Greco as an apprentice, where he studied for several years, his name appearing until 1606 as witness in various documents and contracts relating to his master. He was a close friend of El Greco’s son, Jorge Manuel Theotocopoulos."
4956,"TROGER, Paul","(b. 1698, Welfenberg im Pustertal, d. 1762, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troger/biograph.html,"Austrian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Through his fresco-work and his draughtsmanship, which adapt a vast range of Italian influences, as well as his teaching, he is one of the foremost figures of 18th-century Austrian art. After a long study-tour to Italy he became the favourite fresco painter of the Lower Austrian monasteries. In 1754-57 he became the rector of the Academy in Vienna and he influenced many important painters of the next generation, such as Maulbertsch and Mildorfer.


"
4957,"TROOST, Cornelis","(b. 1697, Amsterdam, d. 1750, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troost/biograph.html,"
The outstanding Dutch painter of the 18th century. He made his name early with a lively group portrait of the Amsterdam Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1724) and continued to enjoy success as a formal portraitist and painter of conversation pieces. He is best known for his pictures of actors in famous roles and for his witty genre scenes. His most famous work - made in his favourite technique of pastel and watercolour - is a series of five pictures entitled NELRI (Mauritshuis, The Hague, 1740); the name is derived from the first letters of the Latin inscriptions which accompany the five views of the activities of a group of men during the night of a reunion. Troost has much in common with his contemporary Hogarth, but unlike Hogarth, Troost is a humorist without an ulterior motive; he never attempted to teach or preach.



"
4958,"TROPININ, Vasily Andreyevich","(b. 1776, Karpovo, d. 1857, Moscow)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tropinin/biograph.html,"
Russian painter. He was a portraitist, representative of the Moscow school of painting, but painted also typical images of Russian life and everyday scenes."
4959,"TROST, Andreas","(b. 1657, Deggendorf, d. 1708, Graz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trost/biograph.html,"
German engraver, known for his copper engravings of cities and castles. He was born in the middle-sized town of Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria. However, he moved to Austria where his stay in Graz is documented  from 1677. In Graz, Trost worked together with the topographer Georg Matthäus Vischer (1628-1696) as the main engraver of Vischer's topography. For this work he produced more than 150 plates. Even after Vischer's death Trost continued to work on the subsequent editions of the topography."
4960,"TROTTI, Giovanni Battista","(b. 1555, Cremona, d. 1619, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trotti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect, the last important exponent of Cremonese Mannerism. He was a pupil of Bernardino Campi and inherited his workshop. The cold, brilliant colours and enamel-like surfaces of Trotti's first recorded works, the Sacrifice of Melchidesek and the Gathering of Manna (both Pralboino Parish Church), closely follow Bernardino's style. More influential, however, were the works of Antonio Campi, seen, for example, in the detailed use of light in the Beheading of St John the Baptist (1590; Museo Civico ""Ala Ponzone"", Cremona), and especially Bernardino Gatti. From the latter Trotti derived the elements of Correggio's style that appear in his work from the early Annunciation (Santa Chiara, Casalmaggiore)."
4961,"TROY, François de","(b. 1645, Toulouse, d. 1730, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troy/francois/biograph.html,"French painter, part of a family of painters. Antoine de Troy (1608-1684) was a painter of modest renown in the Languedoc region. His elder son Jean de Troy (1638-1691) established an academy of art in Montpellier. He was long known only as an academic history painter, but 20th-century research has identified several fine portraits by him on the basis of style, of which the most remarkable is that of Jeanne de Juliard, Dame de Mondonville (c. 1675–80; private collection). Antoine's younger son François de Troy became a fashionable portrait painter in Paris, with a style of portraiture based on Flemish and Dutch models that included van Dyck and Rembrandt. The son of François, Jean-François de Troy, made his name as a painter of portraits, history subjects and tapestry designs, but he is known chiefly for his Rococo 'tableaux de modes', representing fashionable life and amorous encounters."

His successful career was based initially on large historical and allegorical compositions (Time Unveiling Truth, National Gallery, London, 1733), but he is now most highly regarded for his smaller and more spirited scenes of elegant social life. They are among the best of those that rode on the wave of Watteau's success - indeed The Alarm (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1723) was attributed to Watteau in the 19th century. In 1738 he was appointed Director of the French Academy in Rome, and spent the rest of his life there.

4963,"TROYE, Edward","(b. 1808, Lausanne, d. 1874, Georgetown)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troye/biograph.html,"
American painter of Swiss birth. Before 1822, his father, Jean-Baptiste de Troy, a sculptor of minor fame, moved his family to England, where Edward was instructed in drawing and perhaps painting. The animal painter Jacques-Laurent Agasse knew the family well. Troye wrote in 1857 that he was trained in London by the best masters and stated that he followed the style of George Stubbs and John N. Sartorius."
4964,"TROYEN, Rombout van","(b. 1605, Amsterdam, d. 1656, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troyen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was apprenticed for seven years from c. 1615 to Jan Pynas, who influenced his development and introduced him to the painting tradition of Adam Elsheimer. Other artists who affected his style were Jan Pynas's brother Jacob Pynas, and Bartholomeus Breenbergh. After his apprenticeship, van Troyen probably established himself in Amsterdam.



"
4965,"TROYON, Constant","(b. 1810, Sèvres, d. 1865, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/troyon/biograph.html,"
French painter. After training to become a porcelain painter at Sèvres, Troyon became interested in 17th century Dutch landscape painting, particularly the work of Jacob van Ruisdael, Paulus Potter, and Aelbert Cuyp, and subsequently became a member of the Barbizon School. After becoming Chevalier de le Légion d'honneur in 1849, his work shifted from landscapes to the painting of animals, often with labourers. His later landscapes of Normandy were an influence on the Impressionists. All his important pictures are of date between 1850 and 1864.

Italian/Russian sculptor, his real name was Pavel Petrovich Trubetzkoy. He was an aristocrat and self-taught sculptor. He was made a teacher at the Moscow State School of Art in 1897 by the tsar. He achieved fame in Paris where he lived from 1905, with portraits (inspired by Giuseppe Grandi, Rodin, and Rosso) of his contemporaries, including literati such as George Bernard Shaw and Gabriele d'Annunzio. He depicted the society of the Belle Époque. Few of his bronzes are still available in the market. Quite famous is the 35 cm high portrait of Constance Stewart-Richardson called ""The Dancer"". As a convinced vegetarian he also created several animal sculptures."

German painter, son of a jeweler and goldsmith. He began studying painting at the Kuntschule in Karlsruhe in 1867. Two years later he moved to Munich, where he visited the Akademie der Bildenden Künste. After studying for a brief spell in Stuttgart, he returned to Munich, where in 1871 he made the acquaintance of Wilhelm Leibl, a Naturalist painter who had met Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, among others, during his stay in Paris. Encouraged by Leibl, he dropped out of the academy and went to paint in the Lake Starnberg area. Here he had the chance to become acquainted with the new painting trends of his French contemporaries. The years he belonged to the Leibl-Kreis (Leibl Circle) are regarded as the artistic peak in Trübner's career."
4968,"TRUMBULL, John","(b. 1756, Lebanon, CT, d. 1843, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trumbull/biograph.html,"
American painter, architect and diplomat. His importance lies in his historical paintings memorialising events in the American War of Independence. Applying Benjamin West's and John Singleton Copley's realistic innovations in history painting to American subjects, he created a series of images, reproduced in countless illustrations, that have become icons of American nationalism. They are also symbolic of his lifelong political and artistic identity."
4969,"TRUTAT, Félix","(b. 1824, Dijon, d. 1848, Dijon)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/trutat/biograph.html,"

It is not known whether his father was his mother's husband (who was killed in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870), as the personal files of the Akademie der Künste in Berlin state, or, as has been conjectured, the Berlin art dealer Lepke. Tuaillon spent his youth in Berlin, attending the French grammar school until 1879. From 1879 to 1881 he studied at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste, before joining the workshop of the most successful Berlin sculptor of the time, Reinhold Begas, as a pupil. With his neo-Baroque style, Begas set the tone for state art under Emperor William II."

French sculptor of Italian birth. He was the son of a French father and was naturalized French in 1666. He is first mentioned in connection with decorative sculpture (destroyed 1778) for the Porte Saint-Antoine, Paris, and in 1663 he was received (reçu) as a member of the Académie Royale on presentation of the model (untraced) for an allegorical bust of Joy (marble version, 1680; Versailles, Château). He worked in the Gobelins factory under the direction of Le Brun, then collaborated with Coysevox in the tomb of Mazarin (1689-1692)."

Then he continued his education with his fellow townsman Jan Frans van Geel, then already in Antwerp. In 1830 in The Hague, he was a pupil of Lodewijk Royer. Between 1840 and 1844 Tuerlinckx studied in Rome. He produced a bust of Pope Gregory XVI there."

His sculptural figure style was derived in the first place from Mantegna, though its tortuous, metallic quality was a product of Tura's own feverish imagination. He also acquired a feeling for monumentality from Piero della Francesca, who was painting in Ferrara c. 1449.

4975,"TURA, Giovanni Francesco","(b. ca. 1485, Mantova, d. ca. 1546, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tura_g/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, also called Tura Mantovano. He is documented from 1510 to 1546. This highly unusual artist developed a fascinating style, encompassing the influences of a wide range of painters.  The soft sfumato effects, coupled with the mystical, dream-like landscape, recall the styles of Ferrarese artists such as Garofalo, Mazzolino and Dosso Dossi, but the influence of Parmigianino, Lotto and Giulio Romano are also perceptible. Despite all the variety of artistic references, Tura's overall painting manner remains distinctly Mantuan in style."

English painter, one of the greatest and most original of all landscape painters. His family called him Bill or William, but he is now invariably known by his initials. Precociously gifted, he became a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1789 and first exhibited a watercolour at the Academy in 1790, when he was only 15. He studied at the Academy for four years, and during this time also had lessons from Thomas Malton (1748-1804), a topographical watercolourist who specialized in neat and detailed town views. From 1791 Turner began making regular sketching tours, producing many drawings of picturesque views and architectural subjects that he later sold to engravers or worked up into watercolours. At this time his work was more polished but less inventive than that of his friend Girtin (with whom he worked for Dr Monro). Initially he painted only in watercolour, but in 1796 he first exhibited an oil at the Academy, Fishermen at Sea (Tate Gallery, London), a work showing his admiration for 17th-century Dutch marine painting. Only three years later, in 1799, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy at the youngest permitted age (24), and in 1802 he became the youngest ever full Academician. His career flourished in terms of money as well as prestige, for he was hardworking, a good businessman, and frugal by nature (he lived rather squalidly, but he was not miserly or ungenerous, as is sometimes maintained)."

French painter. Scion of an ancient patrician family of Angers, he was the son and grandson of high army officers who had earned a reputation for their publications in the military sciences but also cultivated the arts. His father, a gifted amateur, exhibited two paintings and several drawings of Roman views at the Paris Salon of 1787, anticipating what would become his son's artistic speciality. A devoted royalist, the elder Turpin emigrated in 1794, at the height of the revolutionary Terror, and died penniless in Philadelphia. His family meanwhile found shelter with relatives in Anjou, where his mother supported them by painting portrait miniatures."
4981,"TUXEN, Laurits Regner","(b. 1853, København, d. 1927, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/t/tuxen/biograph.html,"
Danish painter. He was instructed in the tradition of academic realism at the Kunstakademiet in Copenhagen between 1868 and 1872, but later studies in Paris, with Léon Bonnat, and Rome (1879-80) guided him towards naturalism. As professor (1880-1905) at the School of Artistic Studies, Copenhagen, founded to counteract the conversatism of the official Royal Academy of Fine Arts there, Tuxen was able to introduce naturalism to Danish students, making the way for 20th-century modernism."

American painter and printmaker. He began as a painter of window-shades but developed one of the most personal and poetic visions in American landscape painting, portraying nature on canvases. His first artistic training was under Frank Duveneck (1848-1919), with whom he studied first in Cincinnati. Most leading American artists of the late nineteenth century journeyed to Europe to study, usually to France. Twachtman went first to Germany where he worked at the Munich Royal Academy and adopted the forceful brushstrokes, heavy application of paint, and limited, low-key palette that were associated with the circle of Wilhelm Leibl. His absorption of the Munich style, characterized by bravura brushwork and dexterous manipulation of pigment, with the lights painted as directly as possible into warm, dark grounds derived from Frans Hals and Courbet, is reflected in such paintings as Venice Landscape (1878; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) and Landscape (c. 1882; Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, Utica)."

4986,UGO DA CARPI,(c. 1480-c. 1523),https://www.wga.hu/bio/u/ugo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and woodcutter, a pioneer of the chiaroscuro woodcut. In 1516 he requested from the Venetian senate a patent for his method 'of making from woodcuts prints that seem as though painted', and although there are German examples earlier than any known by Ugo, he may have discovered the technique independently. Certainly his prints achieve their pictorial effect better than those of the Germans. They are often based on designs by Raphael and Parmigianino.

Italian painter, also known as Ugolino da Siena. He was probably a pupil of Duccio and perhaps his most faithful follower. He is documented in Siena from 1317 to 1327 and appears to have been an important artist with a successful workshop. None of the documents mentions works of art, however, and it has proved difficult to reconstruct his career. His principal surviving documented work, a polyptych from Santa Croce, Florence, dating from 1325-30, is now dispersed."

Italian goldsmith. The first reference to Ugolino is in 1329 when he and his sons, Ugolino the younger and Giovanni, sold a house. In 1332, Ugolino received compensation in connection with the commission of a chalice that the Comune of Siena was to give to the condottiere Guidoriccio da Fogliano. In 1337-38 Ugolino produced his most important work, the magnificent reliquary of the Santo Corporale (Orvieto Cathedral). The inscription on the reliquary states that it was commissioned by Bishop Tramo Monaldeschi and the canons of Orvieto Cathedral during the pontificate of Benedict XII. It was probably manufactured in Siena; payments date from 7 May 1337 to 27 December 1339, and the total cost was 1374 and a half gold florins.

In 1877, despite being an officer, he took leave of absence, having decided after all to be an artist. He was determined to succeed rapidly in order to justify his late start and almost to the end of his life, therefore, his work revealed a tension between innovation and conformity."

Dutch painter and architect. He was the son of the mayor of Gorinchem, and he became the best glass painter of his century, who went to great trouble to reinvent the techniques of Dirk Crabeth and his brother Wouter. Gorinchem and the surrounding towns all had examples of his stained glass work. Despite this talent and becoming mayor of Gorinchem himself, Ulft would go down in history for his own contributions to art in the area of oil painting and engraving old ruins, showing each crack and cranny. He painted many Italianate landscapes with monuments and triumphal arches, but these were based on Italianate prints, because according to Houbraken he had never been to Italy."

He was first mentioned working as an assistant to Donatello in September 1447 when he and Giovanni da Pisa (died c. 1460), Antonio Chellini and Francesco del Valente (active 1446-1464) were each paid for the execution of an Evangelist's symbol and a relief of an angel for the high altar of the Santo, Padua (although which sculptor did which pieces is not specified). Soon afterwards Urbano apparently worked in Perugia, designing the tomb of the university professor Ubaldo Bartolini (Perugia University) and the wall tomb of Archbishop Andrea Giovanni Baglioni (d. 1451; Perugia Cathedral), before establishing himself permanently in Siena. In July 1451 he was commissioned to design two marble statues of saints for the Loggia di Mercanzia (Loggia di S Paolo), Siena, which were never carved. In 1462 Urbano carved a marble bench for the loggia ornamented with personifications of the four Cardinal Virtues.

In 1854 he won a scholarship to study in Rome and for several years worked on the large-scale painting that established his reputation, the Expulsion of the Duke of Athens from Florence (1860; Florence, Pitti). This major example of the new realistic tendency in Romantic history painting was acclaimed for its subject - a 14th-century event that alluded to the expulsion in 1859 of Grand Duke Leopold II (1797-1870), in the course of Italian unification - and for the modernity of its realistic representation. It shows the influence of Paul Delaroche and Domenico Morelli, particularly in its dramatic groupings, vivid characterizations and violent colours."
5004,"UTENS, Giusto","(active 1599, d. 1609 in Carrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/u/utens/biograph.html,"
Giusto (Justus) Utens was a Flemish/Italian painter, the son of Pietro di Giovanni da Bruxelles. In 1599-1602, he made a pictorial record of all 14 Medici villas in lunette form for the third grand duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I. He moved to Carrara about 1580, where he married, and where later he returned and died.



"
5005,"UTRECHT, Adriaen van","(b. 1599, Antwerpen, d. 1652, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/u/utrecht/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was apprenticed to Herman de Ryt in 1614 and later visited France, Italy and Germany before returning to Antwerp by 1625. He painted pantry scenes, farmyards with poultry, fish markets, game pieces, garlands and diverse still-lifes of fruit and vegetables. Game paintings are most frequent and reflect the influence of Frans Snyders. Adriaen adopted the same abundant displays of game, fruit and vegetables, usually set on a table parallel to the picture plane. Compositions typically fall in horizontal and vertical lines in contrast to the dynamic diagonals of Snyders. In large works, such as the Still-life with Game, Vegetables, Fruit and a Cockatoo (1650; Getty Museum, Malibu), Adriaen's accessories overflow the table on to the floor below. Baroque devices, such as a sweeping curtain and background window view, add movement and depth. Van Utrecht favoured warm earthen tones, especially grey-green, and a strong chiaroscuro light in his still-lifes; the latter may derive from his knowledge of Italian painting."

Moyses Matheusz van Uyttenbroeck (also Moses van Wtenbrouck), Dutch painter and etcher. He was the younger brother of the painter Jan (Matheusz.) van Uyttenbroeck (c. 1581-1651), who was accepted into the Guild of St Luke in The Hague in 1614. Moyses van Uyttenbroeck was a contemporary of the group of history painters now known as the Pre-Rembrandtists, who were active in Amsterdam. However, compared with the varied repertory of subjects depicted by the Pre-Rembrandtists, his range was limited, being mainly centred on themes from the Old Testament and Classical mythology, the latter usually based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. He also painted pastoral scenes, which are often difficult to distinguish clearly from the mythological works. Representations of bacchanalia with music, dancing and erotic scenes are particularly prevalent. A few portraits by him have also survived, including a picture thought to be a self-portrait (private collection).

Dutch painter and engraver. He was a painter of portraits, landscapes and trompe-l'oeil paintings and a mezzotint artist who was active in England for most of his career."
5009,"VACCARO, Andrea","(b. 1604, Napoli, d. 1670, Napoli)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vaccar/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He belonged to a large and important family of Neapolitan painters and was one of many artists influenced by the dramatic light effects of the Caravaggisti, followers of Caravaggio. He first studied literature but at an early age turned to painting. He was probably a pupil of the late-Mannerist painter Gerolamo Imparato, though there are no known works from this period. About 1620 he became a follower of Caravaggio; he copied Caravaggio's Flagellation (Naples, Capodimonte), and his copy and the original hung in S Domenico Maggiore, Naples (copy in situ). David with the Head of Goliath (Florence, Fondazione Longhi) and Sebastian (Naples, Capodimonte) are early works indebted to Caravaggio's naturalism and chiaroscuro."
5010,"VACCARO, Lorenzo","(b. 1655, Napoli, d. 1706, Torre del Greco)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vaccaro/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor, architect, silversmith and painter. He was the son of a lawyer and began to study law, but a precocious gift for drawing led him to study both sculpture and architecture with Cosimo Fanzago. On Fanzago's death (1678) Vaccaro inherited several important commissions, one of which was the marble monument to Francesco Rocco in the church of the Pietà dei Turchini, Naples. In this powerfully realistic work (begun 1676 by Fanzago and completed by Vaccaro two years later) the portly Rocco kneels on a cushion, his left hand spread across his ample chest and his voluminous drapery overlapping the surrounding frame.

5011,"VADDER, Lodewijk de","(b. 1605, Bruxelles, d. 1655, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vadder/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter, draughtsman, engraver and tapestry designer. He was received as a master in the Brussels Guild of St Luke on 15 May 1628, probably, like his brother Hubert de Vadder, after an apprenticeship to his elder brother, Philippe de Vadder (Coeckelberghs). Lodewijk is best known as a landscape painter, although he also executed landscape engravings and drawings. He was granted a privilege to make tapestry cartoons by the Brussels city magistrate in 1644. In this capacity he worked mainly for weavers such as Jean Courdijn and Baudouin van Beveren. The latter referred to him as the best landscape painter in the country and in 1644 paid him 1000 florins for a series of designs of the Story of Diana and Pan.

5012,"VAFFLARD, Pierre-Auguste","(b. 1777, Paris, d. 1837, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vafflard/biograph.html,"
French painter. A pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault, he exhibited regularly in the Salon between 1800 and 1831. He executed a number of unremarkable academic works on Classical subjects, for example Electra (1804; exhibited Salon 1814) and Orestes Sleeping (1819; both Dijon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). Vafflard gained more success with his Troubadour pictures, which he began to paint in the early 19th century, at the outset of this fashion. They are remarkable for their absence of colour, their theatrical quality and contrasted lighting effects. One of his earliest Troubadour scenes was Emma and Eginhard (exhibited Salon 1804; Evreux, Musée Evreux), based on an episode in the history of Charlemagne's court and painted at a time when the Holy Roman Empire was in fashion in official French circles. In this sentimental painting Vafflard demonstrated his historicizing intentions by emphasizing medieval costume and Gothic architecture and seeking to create an atmosphere similar to the romans de la chevalerie, so highly thought of in France at the end of the 18th century."

Luigi Valadier was the son of the French-born Andrea Valadier (1695-1759), who had settled in Rome in 1714, where he learned the silversmith's art. After his father's death in 1759, Luigi managed the workshop with his brother Giovanni (1732-1805). The Valadier workshop produced scaled-down copies of classical prototypes for eighteenth-century collectors."

He received his first artistic training from his father-in-law and probably not during the journey he is supposed to have made to Italy. Between 1600 and 1605 he was registered at the Guild of St Luke in The Hague, in 1612 as a master. During this period he probably made all but two of his etchings, a woodcut of the Inspiration of St Jerome (1613) and a painting of Venus as Temptress (private collection)."

He was active mainly in Mechelen where his best works (organ case and benches) can be seen in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-over-de-Dijlekerk and the Sint-Janskerk. He sculpted a pulpit for the Sint-Katelijnekerk and several sculptures for the Sint-Romboutscatedraal."
5021,"VALDAMBRINO, Francesco di","(b. 1363, ?, d. 1435, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/valdambr/biograph.html,"
Italian sculptor. He is best known as the friend and occasional collaborator of Jacopo della Quercia in Lucca and Siena, but he already had a considerable reputation before his association with della Quercia. In 1401 Francesco was invited to participate in the competition for the second set of bronze doors for the Florentine Baptistery together with Lorenzo Ghiberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Niccolò di Piero Lamberti, Niccolò d'Arezzo, Simone da Colle and Jacopo della Quercia. His first dated work is a polychromed wooden statue of the standing Virgin and Child (1403), in S Andrea, Palaia. Both the delicate Virgin and Child and the rigidly iconic St Peter (Montalcino, Museo Diocesano) are in the Late Gothic style then current in Pisa, and show the influence of Nino Pisano in particular."
5022,"VALDÉS LEAL, Juan de","(b. 1622, Sevilla, d. 1690, Sevilla)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/valdes/juan/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter and engraver, born in Seville, where he worked from 1656 after some early years in Cordova. With Murillo he helped to found an academy of painting there in 1660, and after Murillo's death in 1682 he was the leading artist in the city. Like Murillo, he was primarily a religious painter, but he was very different in style and approach. He had a penchant for macabre or grotesque subject-matter, and his style is characterized by feverish excitability, with a vivid sense of movement, brilliant colouring, and dramatic lighting. His most remarkable works are two large Allegories of Death (commissioned 1672) in the Hospital de la Caridad, Seville. He also polychromed Roldán's great altarpiece in the Caridad.

Spanish painter and engraver, son of Juan de Valdés Leal. At the age of eleven he engraved four plates which are to be found in Fiestas de Seville a la canonización de San Fernando and form emblematic allusions to the virtues of that Saint. He became mathematical master of the Marine College at Cádiz, but continued to engrave until his death there. He also painted pictures of saints and portraits, several of which he engraved. One of his prominent painting was the Spanish victory in the Battle of Lepanto."
5024,"VALENCIENNES, Pierre-Henri de","(b. 1750, Toulouse, d. 1819, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/valencie/biograph.html,"
French painter. He trained at the academy in Toulouse under the history painter Jean-Baptiste Despax (1709-73). In 1769 he went to Italy for the first time, with Mathias Du Bourg, a councillor at the Toulouse parliament. Du Bourg introduced him to Etienne-François, Duc de Choiseul, a keen patron of the arts, who in turn recommended him to Gabriel-François Doyen, one of the leading history painters in Paris, whose studio he entered in 1773. Doyen gave his pupil a sense of the elevated ideals of history painting but was also sympathetic to the lesser genre of landscape. Valenciennes presumably frequented Choiseul's country seat at Chanteloup, near Amboise, meeting there the landscape painters Hubert Robert and Jean Houel, both protégés of Choiseul. His early interest in the native landscape can be seen in his sketchbooks (Paris, Louvre), especially one dated 1775 that contains drawings made at Amboise, Compiègne and Fontainebleau, and in a later series of oil studies on paper made in Brittany, at the mouth of the River Rance and around St Malo."
5025,VALENTIN DE BOULOGNE,"(b. 1591, Coulommier-en-Brie, d. 1632, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/valentin/biograph.html,"
Moise Valentin (also called Le Valentin and Valentin de Boulogne), French Caravaggesque painter active in Rome from about 1612. His life is obscure; the name 'Moise' (the French form of Moses) by which he was called was not his Christian name (which is unknown) but a corruption of the Italian form of 'monsieur'. He did, however, have one major public commission - The Martyrdom of SS. Processus and Martinian (Vatican, 1629-30), painted for St Peter's as a pendant to Poussin's Martyrdom of St Erasmus."

Domenico Valeriani and his brother Giuseppe (d. 1762) were Italian painters, pupils of Marco Ricci in Venice. They often worked together both in Italy and abroad as designers and perspective painters (the choir of the church of the Scalzi, ballroom in the Casina di Caccia, Stupinigi). In 1742, Giuseppe went to St. Petersburg where he served as the principal decorator of the court theaters. He executed wall panels and ceilings in the palaces of St. Petersburg and its environs. He died in St. Petersburg.

He painted some pictures for the churches of Bologna, but is more known as an engraver and painter of miniatures. Among his works in Bologna are a Scourging of Christ in the church of San Pietro, the Annunciation, at the Mendicanti, and St Roch Curing the Victims of the Plague, in the church dedicated to that saint. In Rome, he painted the ceiling of the library in the Casino dell'Aurora, Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi."

Though she thus belonged to artistic circles, when received (reçue) by the Académie Royale in 1770, on presentation of the still-lifes Attributes of Painting and Musical Instruments (both Paris, Louvre), she was known to have neither a teacher nor an official patron. She managed to get some training from a well-known marine painter, Joseph Vernet, but she picked up still-life all but on her own. She entered the Royal Academy in her mid-twenties, as precocious as François Boucher had been - and one of only four women before the Revolution."

He created medal portraits of Cosimo III de'Medici (Bargello, Florence) and Gian Gastone de'Medici (Galleria Estense, Modena). In 1725 he competed against Pietro Bracci in the Accademia di San Luca's competition for young artists; he shared the first prize with Bracci.

French sculptor. He was a student of both Antoine-Louis Barye and Emmanuel Frémiet, capturing the finest points of both masters. From Barye, Valton learned the importance of detail and definition of his subjects and from Frémiet he received the sensitivity and ability to project his subjects in a natural state. From the age of fifteen Valton spent much of his time at the Jardin des Plantes with Barye and Fremiet who were both directors at that famous Paris zoological garden."

He collaborated with Nicholas Hawksmoor on Castle Howard (first design, 1699) and Blenheim Palace (begun 1705). He was also a successful author of comedies. He was largely self-taught as an architect. In 1702 he received the post of Comptroller of the Queen's Works, the second office in royal building in England."
5036,"VANDERBANK, John the Younger","(b. 1694, London, d. 1739, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vanderba/biograph.html,"
English painter and illustrator of Dutch origin. He was first instructed in drawing by his father, John Vanderbank the Elder (d. 1717), a tapestry-weaver of Soho, London. He worked at Kneller's Academy from its foundation in 1711 but broke away in 1720 and with Louis Chéron (1660-1725) set up a new school in St Martin's Lane, London, at which a greater emphasis was placed on life drawing."

American painter. The grandson of Pieter Vanderlyn (1687-1778), a portrait painter active in the Hudson River Valley, he manifested an early talent for penmanship and drawing. During his late youth he moved to New York, where he worked in a frame shop and studied in Archibald Robertson's drawing academy. His copy of a portrait by Gilbert Stuart brought him to the attention of that artist, with whom he then worked in Philadelphia."
5039,"VANNI, Francesco","(b. 1563, Siena, d. 1610, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vanni_f/biograph.html,"
Painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He studied first in Siena with his stepfather Arcangelo Salimbeni, and then in Rome (1579-80) with Giovanni de' Vecchi. The stylistic sources of his earliest works, such as the Baptism of Constantine (1586-87, Siena, S Agostino), lie both in the art of Salimbeni, which represented a reaction against the artificiality of Mannerism, and in the art of the Counter-Reformation in Rome, particularly that of Federico Zuccaro."
5040,"VANNI, Lippo",(active 1340-1375 in Siena),https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vanni_l/biograph.html,"
Lippo Vanni (Lippo di Vanni), Italian painter and illuminator. He is documented as a painter and illuminator in Siena between 1344 and 1375, and in 1360 and 1373 he took part in the General Council of Siena. The earliest work attributed to him is the illumination of the choirbooks for the Collegiata at San Gimignano (c. 1340-42; San Gimignano, Museo Arte Sacra), in which the supple movement and individuality of figures and scenes already show the expressive quality characteristic of Lippo's later documented work. In these illuminations the decorated initial is conceived as an aperture and not a framing device, and even principal figures are often only partially visible. Lippo treated the historiated initial in different ways in each major series of illuminations. In a Gradual for the Collegiata at Casole d'Elsa, near Siena, bold and brilliant colour contrasts and harmonies unify the letter and its historiation; architectural details are more complex and are used to create an impression of greater depth. This spatial effect is undoubtedly a response to the art of Pietro Lorenzetti, as is the treatment of form; the figures, although often dynamic, are more compact and solid, and their faces are distinctly modelled.



"
5041,"VANNINI, Ottavio","(b. 1585, Firenze, d. 1644, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vannini/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He studied with Domenico Passignano in Florence and with Anastasio Fontebuoni (1580-1626) in Rome. In 1605, together with the Sienese painter Pietro Sorri (1556-1622), he executed one of his first commissions by completing the decoration of the Brunaccini Chapel in the church of the SS Annunziata in Florence. Probably he then moved to Rome as Passignano's assistant, which makes his work of this period difficult to isolate and identify confidently. Nonetheless, under the influence of his studies of Raphael and Michelangelo, he developed a personal style based on 16th-century classicism."

Spanish painter who spent his entire life in his native city Seville. He was one of the disciples of Juan de las Roelas. Only few paintings are known by him. There are two representations of the Last Supper, one of them made in 1622, probably inspired by a Mannerist engraving, is located in the Church of San Bernardo in Seville, the other with an iconography very similar, is on display at the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville.  Also of note is the Portrait of Martinez Montanes (1616) and San Miguel Archangel (1629)."

Italian painter, part of a family of artists. She learned how to paint from her father, Dario Varotari, and her younger brother, Alessandro Varotari (known as Il Padovanino). Varotari has been described as being devoted to her brother, serving as his assistant and following him to various Italian cities. Some sources state that she refused to marry in order to continue her work with him. However, Varotari's devotion to her brother did not prevent her from pursuing her own interests and artistic career. She is equally notable for her written works and the steps that she took to promote her own paintings."
5046,"VAROTARI, Dario the Elder","(b. 1539, Verona, d. 1596, Padova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/varotari/dario/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of artists. Although born in Verona, Varotari trained as a painter in Venice under Paolo Veronese. Although he spent the majority of his career working in Padua, his artistic style was distinctly Venetian. The interest in rich colouring and atmospheric landscape can also be found in the paintings of his master, although his figures are perhaps more indebted to Tintoretto and Titian. He painted extensively in both Padua and Venice and recent scholarship has focused in particular on his fresco cycles. Most of his known paintings are frescos, and one of his most significant works is a cycle at the Sculoa della Carità in Padua depicting The Life of the Virgin."
5047,"VASANZIO, Giovanni","(b. ca. 1550, Utrecht, d. 1621, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vasanzio/biograph.html,"

5048,"VASARI, Giorgio","(b. 1511, Arezzo, d. 1574, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vasari/biograph.html,"Italian painter, architect and biographer, one of Italy's busiest and most influential Mannerist artists. Born in the Florentine subject city of Arezzo, Giorgio was the child of a potter, and precocious enough for Cardinal Silvio Passerini, guardian of the young Ippolito and Alessandro de' Medici, to sponsor his education alongside them in Florence - presumably to act as a provincial spur to their overprivileged laggardliness. Thus began a connection with the Medici that lasted until the death of the steadiest patron of his work as a painter, architect and decorator-of-all-work, the Grand Duke Cosimo I. Thanks to a steady succession of Medicean and papal commissions (interspersed with others from individuals and religious bodies), Vasari produced an immense volume of artistic work, helped by a natural fluency and by teams of capable assistants: both were factors in his contemporary fame as an artist and his subsequent neglect - until quite recently. He was trained in Florence, in the circle of Andrea del Sarto and his pupils Rosso and Pontormo, where, above all, he became a Michelangelo idolater.

5049,"VASI, Giuseppe","(b. 1710, Corleone, d. 1782, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vasi/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver and painter. After completing a classical education, he trained as a printmaker in Palermo, possibly at the Collegio Carolino, which was founded by the Jesuit Order in 1728 and at which the etcher Francesco Ciché (active before 1707-1742) was a teacher. Vasi was already an accomplished engraver when, in 1736, he contributed to the illustration of La reggia in trionfo by Pietro La Placa, which described the festivities held in Palermo to mark the coronation of Charles VII of Naples (the future Charles III of Spain). That same year Vasi moved to Rome, where, as a Neapolitan subject, he was immediately afforded the protection of the ambassador, Cardinal Troiano Aquaviva d'Aragona (1694-1747)."
5050,"VASSALLETTO, Pietro",(active 1154-1186 in Rome),https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vassalet/biograph.html,"
Pietro Vassalletto was an Italian sculptor belonging to a family of artists active in the 12th-14th centuries in Rome. Two Roman families of marbleworkers (marmorati) operated on a vast scale at this period. Cosmati and Vassalletto. At Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, San Giovanni in Laterano and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura the carving and mosaic decoration are the work of these families. The responsibility for the entire work in the cloister of San Giovanni in Laterano can be attributed to the Vassalletto family."
5051,"VASSALLO, Antonio Maria","(b. ca. 1620, Genova, d. 1664/72, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vassallo/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and etcher. He was from a wealthy family and received a good education before starting his training as an artist with the Flemish painter Vincent Malo (active 1634-1649). Despite his rather brief artistic career, his oeuvre is comparatively large. Most of his pictures exhibit the same figure style, brownish colour scheme and technique, and, judging from the dates of SS Francis, Clare, Agnes and Catherine (1648; Genoa, Galleria Palazzo Bianco) and the Martyrdom of Marcello Mastrilli (1664, formerly read as 1637; ex-convent of Carignano), Vassallo remained active for a number of years."
5052,"VASSÉ, Louis-Claude","(b. 1716, Paris, d. 1772, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vasse/biograph.html,"
French sculptor. Son and pupil of the decorative sculptor François-Antoine Vassé (1681-1736), he entered Edme Bouchardon's workshop, becoming his favourite pupil. In 1739 he won the Prix de Rome with a bas-relief representing Jezebel Devoured by Dogs (untraced), and the following year he went to the Académie de France in Rome, returning to Paris in 1745. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1748 and received (reçu) as a full member in 1751 on presentation of a statuette of a Sleeping Shepherd (marble; Paris, Louvre). In 1761 he was made professor at the Académie Royale, and he was appointed Dessinateur de l'Académie des Inscriptions in 1762."
5053,"VASSILACCHI, Antonio","(b. 1556, Melos, d. 1629, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vassilac/biograph.html,"
Italian painter of Greek descent (called Il Aliense). He arrived in Venice not later than 1571, when his father was supplying provisions to the Venetian fleet. It is unlikely that he had received any artistic training in Greece; probably his first teacher was Paolo Veronese, in whose workshop in Venice he was involved in the copying of drawings and paintings. In 1574, together with Veronese and Tintoretto, he was employed decorating the triumphal arch (destroyed) erected on the Venice Lido, after designs by Andrea Palladio, for the arrival of Henry III, King of France. He worked with Benedetto Caliari on the frescoes in the bishop's residence at Treviso (c. 1579) and, with Dario Varotari, on the decoration of the Villa Emo Capodilista at Montecchia, near Padua. In these works he adopted the dramatic chiaroscuro effects of Tintoretto, rather than following the painterly effects of his master, Veronese; of all Venetian Mannerists he followed Tintoretto most closely."

French architect. He was a student at the Ecole Royale d'Architecture and a student of Antoine-François Peyre (1739-1823), whose office was from the late 1770s one of the most engaged in promoting architectural Neo-classicism. Vaudoyer won the Prix de Rome in 1783 and spent the years 1784-88 at the Académie de France in Rome. He explored the limits of symbolism and pure geometric form in architecture in a series of private sketches, most notably in his famous design for a Maison d'un cosmopolite, which, in the spirit of Boullée's famous design for a cenotaph to Newton, was designed in the form of a sphere, or globe, unadorned except for the patterns of the constellations pierced in its surface to light the interior spaces."

Spanish painter. He probably trained either with Luis de Vargas or with his pupil Antonio de Arjián in Seville, where Vázquez worked from 1588 until his departure for New Spain in 1603. Influenced by the work of northern Renaissance masters such as Marten de Vos and Maarten van Heemskerck, Vázquez's art is a good example of late 16th-century Mannerism in Seville. The sculpturesque quality of his forms, interest in detail and taste for exaggerated gestures and contorted poses reflect both Italian and Flemish influences. Vázquez earned a reputation for his virtuoso treatment of still-lifes in his paintings, as in Lazarus and the Rich Man (1588-1603; untraced), painted for Fernando Enríquez de Ribera, 3rd Duque de Alcalá."

He was one of the most important artists working in Valladolid in the first half of the 16th century, producing works which may still be found today in their original locations in and around the city, such as the Alderetes altarpiece in the church of Salvador, Simancas, dated 1536, or the altarpiece in the church of Santa María la Sagrada, Tordehumos."

5060,"VECCHIA, Pietro della","(b. ca. 1602, Venezia, d. 1678, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vecchia/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. Until 1984 he was mentioned as Pietro Muttoni, called della Vecchia. However, this description was founded on a misunderstanding created by Lanzi, who in his Storia pittorica della Italia confused the name of the artist with the name of a collection, Muttoni, in which he had seen one of his paintings. In fact, Pietro was from the well-known Venetian family, the della Vecchia. His earliest known works, two representations of St Francis, which have survived in many versions (e.g. Modena, Galleria Estense; Rovigo, Accademia Concordi), and a Crucifixion (1633; Venice, S Lio) are so heavily influenced by Carlo Saraceni and his student and collaborator Jean Leclerc as to suggest that della Vecchia trained with them. Certain Caravaggesque elements, which remained in his work for some time to come, suggest that he spent some time in Rome after Leclerc had left Venice, in 1621 or 1622. The influence of Alessandro Varotari or Padovanino, who is described by sources as della Vecchia's teacher, is only noticeable in dated works from 1635 onwards."
5061,VECCHIETTA,"(b. ca. 1412, Castiglione di Val d'Orcia, d. 1480, Siena)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vecchiet/biograph.html,"
Vecchietta (Lorenzo di Pietro di Giovanni), one of the outstanding Sienese artists of the 15th century, a painter, sculptor, architect, and military engineer. He was formerly believed to have been born c. 1412 in the Tuscan town of Castiglione d'Orcia, but in 1970 he was identified with the Lorenzo di Pietro di Giovanni who was baptized in Siena in 1410. He was probably trained by Sassetta, but he also came under the influence of Florentine art and his large-scale paintings have a monumentality rare in Siena in the quattrocento. As a sculptor he worked in wood and marble and late in his career in bronze, this change in medium reflecting the influence of Donatello, who was in Siena 1457-59. The Risen Christ (Sta Maria della Scala, Siena, 1476) has something of Donatello's sinewy expressiveness. Donatello's influence may also account for the strength and plasticity of Vecchietta's later paintings, such as the St Catherine in the Town Hall, Siena, and the Assumption in Pienza Cathedral, both dating from 1461/2. Another side to Vecchietta's talent is seen in his delightful illuminations in a manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy (British Library, London, c.1440).

Italian painter, part of a family of painters of which the most famous was his younger brother Titian (Tiziano Vecellio). Other members of the family are Orazio Vecellio (c. 1525-1576, son of Titian), Marco Vecellio (1545-1611, son of Francesco), Tizianello (Tiziano Vecellio, c. 1570-1650, son of Marco)."
5063,"VEEN, Otto van","(b. 1556, Leiden, d. 1629, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/veen/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. From c. 1575 to c. 1580 he was in Italy where he was a pupil of Federico Zuccaro, and after working in various places in Germany and Flanders he settled in Antwerp in 1592. He was an uninspired Mannerist painter, but he had a successful career by modelling his work on Italian masters such as Correggio and Parmigianino (The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1589). His love of Italian art and his scholarly inclinations (he often Latinized his name to Octavio Vaenius) must have been appreciated by Rubens, who had his final training in van Veen's studio. It was also van Veen who advised Rubens to go to Italy in 1600.



"
5064,"VEERENDAEL, Nicolaes van","(b. 1626, Antwerpen, d. 1691, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/veerenda/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. He was taught by his father, Willem van Veerendael, and was a member of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke by 1657. Apart from some allegorical scenes with monkeys in the style of Jan Breughel the Elder and David Teniers the Younger, van Veerendael painted flower-pieces. Initially these were small, bright, graceful bouquets in tall, narrow vases, or cartouches and garlands surrounding a religious scene, sometimes by another artist, such as the Cartouche with the Virgin Surrounded by a Floral Wreath (Berlin, Staatliche Museen), in which the central grisaille is by Erasmus Quellinus."
5065,"VEIT, Philipp","(b. 1793, Berlin, d. 1877, Mainz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/veit/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was the grandson of Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), the German Jewish philosopher, and the stepson, from 1804, of Friedrich von Schlegel (1772-1829), the poet and scholar. He studied (1808-11) at the Akademie in Dresden under Friedrich Matthäi (1777-1845) and Caspar David Friedrich. He showed talent in drawing but, on moving to Vienna in 1811, had difficulties with painting in oil, and turned to watercolour."
5066,"VEKEN, Nicolaas van der","(b. 1637, Mechelen, d. 1709, Mechelen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/veken/biograph.html,"
Flemish sculptor and painter. He was a pupil of Maximilaan Labbé (active c. 1629) and Lucas Faydherbe and became a master sculptor of the Mechelen Guild of St Luke in 1662. He worked almost entirely in wood and, unusually, coloured his own figures, which perhaps accounts for their exceptional synthesis and unity. He is best known for his confessionals, including those in churches St Catherine, St John, and Sts Peter and Paul in Mechelen. He made also charming polychrome wooden figures of saints in the Kempen district near Antwerp.

Swiss sculptor, active mainly in northern Italy. He was born in the village of Ligornetto in Ticino, where a museum today collects much of his works. Advised by his family to become a stonemason, he joined his brother Lorenzo, a sculptor, in Milan in 1834. There he learned as an apprentice and attended the Academy of Brera. He worked in the marble sculptor corporation of the Duomo di Milano."
5068,"VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y","(b. 1599, Sevilla, d. 1660, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/velazque/biograph.html,"The greatest painter of the Spanish School. He was born in Seville, where in 1610/11 he was apprenticed to Pacheco (possibly following a brief period of study with Herrera the Elder). In 1617 he qualified as a master painter and in the following year he married Pacheco's daughter. Velázquez was exceptionally precocious and while he was still in his teens he painted pictures that display commanding presence and complete technical mastery. Pacheco's style in religious paintings was Italianate, dry, and academic; Velázquez revitalized it by following his master's advice to 'go to nature for everything', and in works such as The Immaculate Conception (National Gallery, London, c. 1618) and The Adoration of the Magi (Prado, Madrid, 1619) he developed a more lifelike approach to religious art in which the figures are portraits rather than ideal types (his young wife may be the model for the Virgin in both these pictures). The light, too, is realistically observed, even though it has a mysterious, spiritual quality. In their strong chiaroscuro as well as their naturalism such pictures show an affinity with the work of Caravaggio and his followers. The clotted but supple brushwork is, however, already entirely Velázquez's own. Contemporary with these religious works were a series of bodegones, a type of genre scene to which he brought a new seriousness and dignity, as in The Waterseller of Seville (Wellington Museum, London, c. 1620).

Jan was trained in Haarlem, although who taught him is not known. He specialised in still-life painting. Jan Jansz. van de Velde moved to Amsterdam in 1656. His early still-lifes resemble the work of Pieter Claesz and Willem Heda in both style and content.

Almost all of his monumental work has been lost, the only surviving ensemble is the series of windows that he designed in 1517 for King's College Chapel, Cambridge for Henry VIII.

He is next mentioned in 1625 when he entered the Guild of Saint Luke in Delft. Apparently his family was so poor that his mother had to pay in three instalments the registration fee and the first annual membership fee. It is often assumed that he was the pupil of Anthonie Palamedesz, but there is no documentary evidence of it. He never needed to earn a living from his painting, since in 1626 he married Geertgen Jans Crol, a wealthy Catholic widow."

Italian painter. He worked in Verona between 1517-45; his name appears in documents not only as a painter, but also as a baker and tailor. He was a pupil of Liberale da Verona. One of his brothers was a painter too. As an artist he primarily painted religious-themed paintings for church commissions. He painted a Madonna and Child with Two Angels in 1518 (Verona, Museo Civico di Castelvecchio), and was commissioned by Cardinal Bernardo Clesio to paint frescoes (now lost) in Toblino Castle near Levico, Trent, in 1536. A fresco fragment, possibly by Antonio, showing the Madonna and Child and St Roch, survives in the church of Santa Maria in Stelle, Verona.

Dutch painter, draughtsman and poet. De Bie's account (1661) is the only known source on van de Venne's youth and training. He was born of 'worthy' parents who had fled to Delft from the southern Netherlands to escape war and religious strife. Inspired by his early study of Latin to become an illustrator, he was partly self-taught but also received instruction in painting and illumination from the otherwise unrecorded Leiden goldsmith and painter Simon de Valck. His second teacher, Hieronymus van Diest (not the later marine artist), is equally obscure, but according to de Bie he painted grisailles, a technique that van de Venne later employed extensively."

His first important commission, to copy Michelangelo's Last Judgement (Rome, Vatican, Sistine Chapel), came from Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1548; the small-scale painting (Naples, Capodimonte) is a valuable document of the appearance of the fresco before Daniele da Volterra added draperies. It secured Venusti's reputation and began his long friendship with Michelangelo, who allowed him to execute numerous small-scale paintings based on his designs, usually of religious subjects."

Belgian painter and printmaker. The son of the sculptor Barthélemy Verboeckhoven (1759-1840) and brother of Louis-Charles Verboeckhoven, he began drawing as a young child. His initial desire to become a sculptor led him to produce a few models. In 1815 his family moved to Ghent, where he attended the Academie from 1816 to 1818, supported by the sculptor Albert Voituron (1787-1847) and later by a Ghent patron, Ferdinand Van der Haegen. From 1818 he was a pupil of Balthasar-Paul Ommeganck, from whom he imbibed the classical landscape tradition that informed the best of his own work, such as Landscape with Cattle and a Cowherd by a Tree (1824; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). Other works from this period, for example the Halting Place (1826; private collection), heralded a new realism in Verboeckhoven's work. He abandoned the human figure in order to produce prosaic but popular pictures of sheep, cattle and donkeys; these animals take on human characteristics in his work and are reminiscent of bourgeois portraits of the time.

Belgian painter, brother of Eugène-Joseph Verboeckhoven. He studied in Brussels under his father, Barthélemy, and his brother. He concentrated on marine painting, generally scenes from the North Sea, as in Dutch Coast (1840; Musée des Beaux-Arts, Liège). Usually these scenes include a variety of boats, from humble fishing vessels to grand, two-masted brigs from foreign fleets, often shown in swelling or tempestuous seas, their sails billowing in the wind (e.g. Rough Sea, 1841; Stedelijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Kortrijk). Verboeckhoven often collaborated with his brother, the latter filling in many of his compositions with figures and animals. His son, Louis Verboeckhoven (d. 1884), lived in Ghent and painted landscapes, flower-pieces and still-lifes.

Most of his work was done for churches. In 1684 he created two limewood side altars (height 5 m) for the chapel of Our Lady of Good Will at Duffel. Here he introduced into the Netherlands a new motif, derived from the work of Bernini and consisting of an oval painting supported by two flying angels. His communion rails (1,20 m; 1695) for St Walburgis, Bruges, are a highpoint of Flemish Baroque sculpture; the virtuoso handling of the marble makes them look as if modelled from wax."

His typical panoramas are often seen from a high viewpoint and always contain a plethora of landscape elements. They are imbued with a peaceful, poetic atmosphere.

5094,"VERELST, Maria","(b. 1680, Wien, d. 1744, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/verelst/maria/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of painters, niece of Simon Verelst. When she was three years old she moved to London, where she later studied with Simon Verelst and her father Herman Verelst. She became accomplished at finely detailed oil paintings and also as a languages teacher. According to anecdote, her success as a painter was due, at least in part, to her linguistic abilities. One night at the theatre some men near by were conversing at length in German and admiring Maria. She turned to them and, speaking in German, told them that to compliment her in such extravagant terms was no compliment. The men continued in Latin; when Maria then responded in Latin the men were impressed enough to make her acquaintance. Subsequently she painted a portrait of each, and as a result of the men's connections she built up a cultured clientele. A Portrait of a Young Man (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) is attributed by some to Maria Verelst."

Dutch painter, part of a family of painters. Pieter Verelst was from Antwerp and a pupil of Gerrit Dou. He was the father of Herman Verelst, a portrait painter, and Simon Verelst, who was renowned for his flower paintings. Both brothers moved to London to practise. Herman's daughter Maria Verelst followed in his footsteps and enjoyed success in England, while Herman's son Cornelis Verelst (1667-1734) was the father of William Verelst, who was probably the most accomplished portrait painter in the family."
5097,"VERELST, William",(active 1732-1756 in London),https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/verelst/william/biograph.html,"
William (Willem) Verelst, Dutch painter, active in London, part of a family of painters, nephew of Maria Verelst. His major work is perhaps the Georgia Council of 1734-55 (Dupont Museum, Wintherthur), but Verelst also produced a number of small-scale portraits and conversation pieces, including the fine Gough Family (1741; Elvetham Hall, Hants). His life-size portraits are usually distinguished by solid characterization and dramatic lighting, as in John, 9th Earl of Rothes (1732; Leslie House, Fife) and Mrs Bamber (1743; Hatfield House, Herts)."

They both continued their studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg (1858-1865). However, the brothers were noticeably distinguished by their artistic interests. Petr Petrovich Vereshchagin is noted for, first of all, his landscapes."

Russian painter noted for his war scenes. He attended the St. Petersburg Academy and studied in Paris. Devoting his life to travel, he acquired subjects for paintings from on-the-spot impressions in the Caucasus, in Crimea, along the Danube River, and in Turkistan with the Russian army. In the Balkans during the Russo-Turkish War (in which he was wounded), Vereshchagin was provided with the themes for some of his famous war pictures. He also painted in Syria and in Palestine and between 1885 and 1903 traveled in Russia, the United States, and Japan. He died at Port Arthur (now Lüshun, China) during the Russo-Japanese War, aboard the flagship of Admiral Stepan Osipovich Makarov."

Tobias Verhaecht (van Haecht; Verhaegt), Flemish painter and draughtsman, active also in Italy. He spent much of his early life in Florence, where he won the favour of Francesco I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (reg 1574-87), and in Rome, where he earned a reputation as a painter of landscape frescoes. In 1590 he became a master in the Guild of St Luke, Antwerp. A year later he married Suzanna van Mockenborch, a distant relation of Rubens; she died in 1595, and he remarried the next year. Verhaecht was an active member of the rhetoricians' chamber, the Gillyflower, as his father had been, and he wrote a comedy for them in 1620 and donated two complete costumes for torch-bearers. In 1594 he was commissioned to design the decorations for the triumphal entry into Antwerp of Archduke Ernst of Hungary (1553-95). Verhaecht trained several pupils, including his son Willem van Haecht II and, briefly, Rubens.

He also worked under the Antwerp sculptors Michiel van der Voort, Jan Claudius de Cock (1668-1736) and Willem Ignatius Kerricx. His best works are in the Church of St John in Mechelen, but he enjoyed a reputation in Flanders far outside his native city.

Flemish decorative painter who continued in the 18th century the historical painting in the 17th-century style. He remained faithful to Rubens's conception of art down to the 19th century. His main works are the Feast of Belshazzar (Musées Royaux, Brussels) and the Presentation in the Temple (Ghent Museum, 1767).



"

Dutch painter and draughtsman, active in Utrecht. He is a typical representative of Dutch Romanticism, the popular national style of the first half of the 19th century. He painted portraits of his family and friends, small genre pieces and landscapes, although he only gained any degree of renown as an architectural painter. The 17th-century architectural painters Jan van der Heyden and both Job and Gerrit Berckheyde served as his greatest examples.

Flemish sculptor, active mainly in Holland. A native of Mechelen, this aristocrat of Flemish sculpture settled in Holland where he busied himself above all with monuments to the glory of the pioneers of the young Batavian Republic. In the 1650s he was the most important assistant to Artus Quellin. in the sculptural decoration of the Town Hall in Amsterdam. He produced for the Town Hall exceptionally successful works such as the statues of Silence and of Fidelity."

Dutch painter, member of a family of painters. He was the son of a locksmith, specialized in genre scenes set in richly furnished interiors, although he also painted mythological scenes and portraits. His two sons, Nicolaas Verkolje and Johannes Verkolje II (d 1760) were also painters and his followers."
5110,"VERKOLJE, Nicolaas","(b. 1673, Delft, d. 1746, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/verkolje/nicolaas/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists, son of Johannes Verkolje I. He studied with his father and became, like Johannes, a versatile artist, producing not only genre pieces but also mythological scenes, ceiling paintings and portraits. He was also an expert mezzotint artist, like his father. In 1700 Nicolaas settled in Amsterdam, where he remained until his death. He was commissioned in 1731 to make prints after seven paintings by Gérard de Lairesse in the town hall of The Hague. He occasionally painted figures in the work of Isaac de Moucheron.


"
5111,"VERMEER, Johannes","(b. 1632, Delft, d. 1675, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vermeer/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Among the great Dutch artists of the 17th century, he is now second in renown only to Rembrandt, but he made little mark during his lifetime and then long languished in obscurity. Almost all of the contemporary references to him are in colourless official documents and his career is in many ways enigmatic. Apart from a visit to The Hague in 1672 (to act as an expert witness concerning a group of Italian paintings of disputed authenticity), he is never known to have left his native Delft. He entered the painters' guild there in 1653 and was twice elected 'hooftman' (headman), but his teacher is not known. His name is often linked with that of Carel Fabritius, but it is doubtful if he can have formally taught Vermeer, and this distinction may belong to Leonaert Bramer, although there is no similarity between their work."
5112,"VERMEER VAN HAARLEM, Jan the Elder","(b. 1628, Haarlem, d. 1691, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vermeerh/elder/biograph.html,"

Dutch painter and draughtsman, part of a Haarlem family of painters, son of Jan Vermeer van Haarlem the Elder. He was a pupil of his father and of Nicolaes Berchem. He probably visited Italy before entering the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1681. His pictures, for example Landscape with Flock (1677, private collection), display his father's heavy green and yellow tonality, but his subject-matter, shepherds and their flocks in Italianate, and sometimes mountainous, settings, derives from Berchem. His work, like that of his friend Simon van der Does (c. 1653-1718) and that of Dirk van Bergen, constitutes a dilution, rather than a development, of Berchem's style. He made numerous drawings, such as Landscape with Flock and Castle beside a Lake (1704; Hamburg, Kunsthalle), most of which include depictions of sheep. He drew in red or black chalk, often adding watercolour, and he usually signed and dated his work.

Danish painter. In 1844 he went to Copenhagen, where he became a student at the Royal Danish Academy of Art and trained under Jorgen Roed (1808-1888). He exhibited his first painting at Charlottenborg in 1847, A Shoemaker in his Kitchen, which was purchased by Christian VIII and highly praised. This type of depiction of typical Danish folk played a central part of Vermehren's productions in the next several decades. Vermehren continued to show at Charlottenborg throughout his life with few years as exceptions."
5116,"VERMEULEN, Andries","(b. 1763, Dordrecht, d. 1814, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vermeule/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was trained by his father Cornelis Vermeulen (c. 1732-1813), himself a landscape painter and art dealer who is mainly known for his copies after famous masters. Andries specialized in landscapes after seventeenth-century Dutch models. He originally painted landscapes in the manner of Meindert Hobbema, but later preferred to paint ice scenes that resemble the work of Isaack van Ostade in style, for which he is chiefly known. He also created marine paintings and summer landscapes, and made drawings after Aelbert Cuyp. He worked for some time in Amsterdam, where he died on 6 July 1814.

5118,"VERMEYEN, Jan Cornelisz.","(b. ca. 1500, Beverwijk, d. 1559, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vermeyen/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish painter and tapestry designer, probably a pupil of Mabuse. About 1525 he became Court Painter to Margaret of Austria, regent of the Netherlands at Mechelen and in 1535 he accompanied the Emperor Charles V to Tunis. This journey supplied him with scenes for later works, including tapestries designed 1545/48 for the Regent, Mary of Hungary. At present many portraits are ascribed to him on very little evidence, as an alternative to Scorel, Heemskerck or Lucas van Leyden.


"
5119,"VERMIGLIO, Giuseppe","(b. ca. 1585, Alessandria, d. after 1635)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vermigli/biograph.html,"
Italian Caravaggist painter, active in northern Italy and Rome. He spent the first two decades of the seventeenth century in Rome where he trained and worked as an artist. In 1605 he was arrested and imprisoned after being discovered at the Monte di Brianza hostelry bearing an unlicensed sword; and in 1611 proceedings were brought against him for physically attacking the painter Silvio Oliviero. In 1618, still in Rome, he is recorded as a picture dealer. Around 1620 he returned to northern Italy where he pursued his career as a painter in Piedmont (Novara and Alessandria) and in Lombardy (in Mantua and Milan)."

French painter and lithographer, son of Joseph Vernet. His full name is Antoine-Charles-Joseph Vernet. At the age of 11 he entered the studio of Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié. His training culminated in the award of the Prix de Rome in 1782; however, his stay in Rome was terminated when he underwent a 'mystical experience' and was sent back to Paris. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1789 on presentation of the Triumph of Aemilius Paulus (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art). Although his sister Emilie was guillotined, none of the tragic aspects of the Revolution is apparent in his subsequent work. Instead, he concentrated much of his efforts on creating acute observations of daily life. This is especially true of his work after 1816, when he produced engravings of street vendors, horse markets, and dandies."
5121,"VERNET, Claude-Joseph","(b. 1714, Avignon, d. 1789, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vernet/claude/biograph.html,"
French painter, one of the leading landscapists of the period. From 1733 to 1753 he worked in Rome, where he was influenced by the light and atmosphere of Claude and also by the more wild and dramatic art of Salvator Rosa. With Hubert Robert, he became a leading exponent of a type of idealized and somewhat sentimental landscape that had a great vogue at this time. Vernet was particularly celebrated for his paintings of the sea-shore and ports, and on returning to Paris in 1753 he was commissioned by Louis XV to paint a series of the sea-ports of France. The sixteen which he did are in the Louvre."
5122,"VERNET, Horace","(b. 1789, Paris, d. 1863, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vernet/horace/biograph.html,"
Émile-Jean-Horace Vernet, known as Horace Vernet, was son of Antoine-Charles-Horace (known as 'Carle') Vernet and grandson of Claude-Joseph Vernet, one of the leading French landscape painters of his period. He was one of the most prolific of French military painters, specializing in scenes of the Napoleonic era. He remained an ardent Bonapartist, and his chief work was the huge Gallery of Battles at Versailles, painted for Louis Philippe. A portrait of Napoleon and four battlepieces by him are in the National Gallery, London. He also did animal and Oriental subjects. From 1828 to 1835 he was Director of the French Academy in Rome. His sister married the costume-history painter Paul Delaroche.

Dutch portrait painter noted for his portraits of children. He was trained in the studio of his father, Cornelis Engelsz., who painted portraits, kitchen still lifes and genre scenes. He joined the guild of St Luke in 1632 and spent his entire life as a portrait painter of his fellow townsmen. He was more than twenty years younger than Frans Hals and may have worked in his studio. He was certainly powerfully influenced by Hals's style. His most imposing works are the two group portraits of 1641 and 1642 of the Regentesses of the St Elizabeth Hospital which form a counterpart to the portrait of the Regents of the same institution painted by Hals in the same years. All three paintings hang today in the Frans Halsmuseum in Haarlem.

5139,"VIANEN, Adam van","(b. ca. 1568, Utrecht, d. 1627, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vianen/adam/biograph.html,"
Dutch silversmith. He was apprenticed to a family of silversmiths and shortly after 1590 was admitted to the guild. As well as being an artist, he also worked as a brewer. He remained in Utrecht throughout his life, in contrast to his well-travelled brother, Paulus. He was an exponent of the auricular style invented by his brother.



"
5140,"VIANEN, Paulus van","(b. ca. 1570, Utrecht, d. 1613, Prague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vianen/paulus/biograph.html,"
Dutch silversmith. He worked from 1603 until his death in Prague as court goldsmith to Emperor Rudolf II. He was the creator of the auricular style, a 17th-century ornamental style based on parts of the human anatomy. Paulus was inspired by anatomy lectures he attended in Prague. Exponents include his brother, Adam van Vianen, and Adam's son, Christiaen (1598-1666), who worked in England, 1635-39, and later, c. 1660-1666. The auricular style was adopted by other cabinetmakers and carvers in the Low Countries and Germany.



"
5141,"VIANI, Domenico Maria","(b. 1668, Bologna, d. 1711, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/viani/domenico/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, son of Giovanni Maria Viani. He trained with his father and in 1691 he made a visit to Venice, which, though lasting less than a year, was of enduring importance. Viani was profoundly influenced by the great masters of the 16th century, notably Tintoretto and Veronese, and by his contemporaries, especially the tenebrosi Antonio Zanchi and Antonio Molinari."
5142,"VIANI, Giovanni Maria","(b. 1636, Bologna, d. 1700, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/viani/giovanni/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, part of a family of painters, parent of Domenico Maria Viani. He was a pupil of Flaminio Torri, and his first paintings (datable to c. 1650) suggest the art of Guido Reni, absorbed through a study of Cantarini. Under the influence of Lorenzo Pasinelli, a colleague of his in Torri's workshop, his forms gained solidity, but the mood of his paintings remained elegiac. This development is evident in two works in the Santuario della Madonna di San Luca in Bologna: Mary Magdalene and the altarpiece of St Pius V with the Polish Ambassador, which was probably painted in the same early period."
5143,"VIANI, Antonio Maria","(b. ca. 1555, Cremona, d. ca. 1635, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/viani_a/biograph.html,"
Italian painter and architect, also called Vianino. He was a pupil of Giulio Campi. Viani moved to Munich in 1586 to work at the court of William V, Duke of Bavaria (reg 1579-98), where he participated in the decoration of the Residenz (the Antiquarium and the Grottenhof) under the guidance of Friedrich Sustris."
5144,"VICENTINO, Battista","(b. 1520, Vicenza, d. 1583, Venezia?)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vicenti/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver, also called Giovanni Battista Pittoni the Elder. In conjunction with Battista del Moro (1512-after 1568), he engraved a set of fifty plates of landscapes, with ruins and architecture, which are executed in a bold, spirited style.



"
5145,"VICENTINO, Andrea","(b. ca. 1542, Vicenza, d. ca. 1617, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vicentin/biograph.html,"
Andrea Vicentino (originally Andrea Michieli or Michelli), Italian painter. He probably trained in Vicenza with Giambattista Maganza (c. 1509-86). His mature style, however, was largely dependent on his subsequent experience of the dominant stylistic idioms at Venice in the later 16th century. Those of Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Tintoretto, Jacopo Bassano and Palma Giovane were particularly influential."
5146,"VICO, Enea","(b. 1523, Parma, d. 1567, Ferrara)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vico/biograph.html,"
Italian engraver. He trained in Parma and by 1541 was in Rome, where he became a pupil of Tommaso Barlacchi (fl 1527-42). In 1541-42, in collaboration with Barlacchi, he produced his first work, a series of 24 engravings with grotesque decorations in imitation of antique paintings. In Rome, Vico was also influenced by the printmakers Agostino dei Musi, Antonio Salamanca and, above all, Marcantonio Raimondi. Vasari recorded that in 1546, following a short period in Florence, where he made engravings for Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici after works by Michelangelo, Vico applied to live in Venice. He remained there until 1563, when he was summoned to the court of Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, where he lived until his death.

Vicente Victoria (Vittoria in Italy), Spanish painter and printmaker. Born to a Spanish mother and an Italian father, he studied grammar, theology and philosophy in Valencia, and also learnt the rudiments of painting. After 1679 he went to Rome, where he was a pupil of Carlo Maratti and came to get some fame and prestige among painters and cultivated people."
5148,"VICTORS, Jan","(b. ca. 1620, Amsterdam, d. 1676, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/victors/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, one of Rembrandt's lesser known pupils, who joined Rembrandt's studio around 1635. He was far from being a genius and his life was a hard one. He tried to make a living by giving nurcing assistance to families stricken by the plague, and he died during a voyage to the East Indies where he was hoping to retrieve his fortunes."
5149,"VIDAL, Eugène","(b. 1847, Paris, d. 1907, Cagnes)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vidal/biograph.html,"
French painter. He studied with Gérôme in Paris, but he was linked with the Impressionists. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon in 1873. He traveled in Algeria. He exhibited in 1880 at the 5th and in 1881 at the 6th Impressionist exhibitions. He was very successful at the World Fair in Paris in 1900.

5151,"VIEN, Joseph-Marie","(b. 1716, Montpellier, d. 1809, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vien/biograph.html,"
French painter. A winner of the Prix de Rome, he was in Rome at a time (1743-50) that coincided with excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, and in his lifetime he gained a great reputation (partly self-promoted) as a pioneer of the Neoclassical style. He was enthusiastic for the ideas of Winckelmann, but his  classicism was of a very superficial kind, consisting of prim and sentimentalized anecdote or allegory with pseudo-antique trappings (The Cupid Seller, Château de Fontainebleau, 1763). Nevertheless, he gauged the taste of the time well and had a career of exemplary success, becoming director of the French Academy in Rome (1776) and First Painter to the King (1789). He was made a senator by Napoleon after the Revolution, a count in 1808, and was buried in the Pantheon. David was his most important pupil. His son, Joseph-Marie the Younger (1762-1848), was also a painter, mainly of portraits.

Italian painter, also called Jacopo d'Argenta. He was born in Argenta, near Ferrara. He is said to have painted a loggetta in the tower of Santa Caterina in the Castello di Ferrara, depicting the then princes and princesses of the House of Este. In Turin, he became the official portrait painter of the House of Savoy and traveled to France, Spain, Bohemia, and Saxony in this role."
5155,"VIGNALI, Jacopo","(b. 1592, Pratovecchio, d. 1664, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignali/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. At an early age he entered the studio of Matteo Rosselli in Florence, and his first works, Virgin and Saints (1616; Santa Brigida, Santuario della Madonna del Sasso, Florence) and the ceiling painting Love of the Fatherland (1616; Casa Buonarroti, Florence), were influenced by Rosselli and Ludovico Cigoli. In 1616 he enrolled at the Accademia del Disegno in Florence, becoming an academician in 1622."
5156,"VIGNOLA, Giacomo da","(b. 1507, Vignola, Bologna, d. 1573, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignola/biograph.html,"
Italian architect, his real name was Giacomo Barozzi. He was one of the foremost late Renaissance architects in Italy, who, with Andrea Palladio and Giulio Romano, dominated Italian Mannerist architectural design and stylistically anticipated the Baroque."
5157,"VIGNON, Charlotte","(b. 1639, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignon/charlott/biograph.html,"
French painter, daughter of Claude Vignon, one of France's most prominent painters in the 17th century. Still, little is known of her life. Born in Paris in 1639, she was the tenth of twenty-four children of Claude Vignon. Her oeuvre is comprised solely of still-lifes, owing much to the legacy of Italian artist Fede Galizia, a pioneer of the still-life genre.



"
5158,"VIGNON, Claude","(b. 1593, Tours, d. 1670, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignon/claude/biograph.html,"
French painter and engraver, born in Tours and active mainly in Paris. His richly eclective style was formed mainly in Italy, where he worked c. 1616-1622, and his openness to very diverse influences was later fuelled by his activities as a picture dealer. Paradoxically, in view of his varied sources of inspiration, his style is the most distinctive of any French painter of his generation - highly coloured and often bizarrely expressive. Elsheimer and the Caravaggisti were strong influences on his handling of light, and his richly encrusted brushwork has striking affinities with Rembrandt, whose work he is known to have sold. Vignon is said to have fathered more than twenty children by his two wives, and his sons Claude the Younger (1633-1703) and Philippe, as well as her daughter Charlotte were also painters.



"
5159,"VIGNON, Philippe","(b. 1638, Paris, d. 1701, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignon/philippe/biograph.html,"
French painter. He was a son of Claude Vignon, and sibling of Claude François Vignon (1633-1703) and Charlotte Vignon. His father was his only instructor, and under his direction he became a good painter of history and portrait. He became a member of the Académie in 1687 and was best known as a portrait painter - his morceau de réception is of the sculptor Philippe de Buyster.



"
5160,"VIGNON, Alexandre-Pierre","(b. 1763, Paris, d. 1828, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignon_p/biograph.html,"
French architect of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. Trained under Julien David Leroy (1724-1803); he was also a close friend of Claude Nicolas Ledoux. He was appointed Inspecteur général des bâtiments de la République in 1794. In 1807, Napoleon I chose Vignon's uncompromising Neoclassical design for his Temple de la Gloire (after 1813 the Madeleine) in Paris.



"
5161,"VIGNON, Victor Alfred Paul","(b. 1847, Villers-Cottêrets, d. 1909, Meulan)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vignon_v/biograph.html,"
French painter, draftsman, and etcher. He was a pupil of Corot, who heavily influenced his style of painting. He received further guidance and advice from Adolphe Cals. He painted in Pontoise, Auvers-sur-Oise and many other locations alongside Pissarro - with whom he was on friendly terms - Guillaumin and Cézanne. Between 1880 and 1886 he participated in the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Impressionist exhibitions. He was on friendly terms with Dr. Gachet and the van Gogh brothers."

French painter and decorative designer. Little is known of his early training. About 1710 he was working for the Académie Royale de Musique and painting designs for scenery for the Paris Opera. In 1719 he was living in Beauvais and two years later he was working there as an instructor at the tapestry factory. He was required to produce six cartoons a year, few of which still survive. He was succeeded in 1726 by Jean-Baptiste Oudry. Some of his signed and dated work, however, can be seen in the Musée Jacquemart-André in Fontaine-Chaalis, in Glasgow and at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. His work was chiefly decorative, including tapestries, furniture, wood-carvings, screens and fire-screens in a Chinese style.


"
5163,"VIGRI, Caterina","(b. 1413, Bologna, d. 1463, Bologna)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vigri/biograph.html,"
Caterina Vigri (Catherine of Bologna) was an Italian painter and writer as well as a saint. She was raised at the court of Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, whom her father served as a diplomatic agent. Catherine acted as mistress of novices in a Clarisse convent and it was in this capacity that she began to write Le sette armi spirituali (The seven spiritual weapons). She wrote other works, hymns and letters. She also produced frescoes, free-standing paintings, and illuminated manuscripts; the frescoes are gone, but some of her other art has survived."
5164,"VILADOMAT Y MANALT, Antonio","(b. 1678, Barcelona, d. 1755, Barcelona)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/viladoma/biograph.html,"
Spanish Catalan painter. He was the most significant figure in Catalan painting from the end of the 17th century to the first half of the 18th. He trained with P. B. Savall and J. B. Perramón in Barcelona. The arrival of the Archduke Charles (later Charles VI) of Austria in Barcelona in 1703 as a pretender to the throne during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-13), accompanied by such Italian artists as Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena, acquainted Viladomat y Manalt with artistic trends in Italy. He experienced problems with the artists' guild in Barcelona because of his refusal to participate in the traditional work system. Despite this, his workshop-academy became a centre for the training of numerous painters, sculptors and engravers."
5165,"VILLABRILLE Y RON, Juan Alonso","(b. 1663, d. after 1728, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/villabri/biograph.html,"
Spanish sculptor. He moved to Madrid in 1686 where he began his sculpting career working under Pedro Alonso de los Rios (1650-1700). In the following year, he opened his own workshop. His first and only signed and dated piece was a polychromed wooden head of St. Paul. This sculpture was created in 1707 and became famous for its extraordinary realism. Villabrille's other pieces include St. Isodore and St. Mary de la Cabeza, located on the Toledo Bridge in Madrid, and a stone statue of St. Ferdinand in the portal of the Madrid Hospice of St. Ferdinand."
5166,"VILLAMENA, Francesco","(b. 1564, Assisi, d. 1624, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/villamen/biograph.html,"

5167,"VILLANDRANDO, Rodrigo de","(active from 1608, Madrid, d. 1622, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/villandr/biograph.html,"
Spanish painter. He was a pupil and collaborator of Juan Pantoja de la Cruz (whose will he witnessed in 1608) and was a portrait painter at the court of Philip III, an honour that he shared with Bartolomé González and Pedro Antonio Vidal (fl. 1599-1617). In June 1621, in recognition of his merits, Philip IV nominated him Ugier de Cámara, a court position that Velázquez later obtained and that Eugenio Cajés asked for repeatedly without success. He held this post for only a short time, for in December 1622 it was noted that he had already died in Madrid, possibly at a young age, as in June of that year he had been admitted to the studio of Pedro García as an apprentice for six years."
5168,"VILLANUEVA, Juan de","(b. 1739, Madrid. d. 1811, Madrid)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/villanue/biograph.html,"
Spanish architect, part of a family of artists, the son of the sculptor Juan de Villanueva (1681-1765). His brother, the architect Diego de Villanueva (1715-1774) was his protector and teacher. Along with Ventura Rodríguez, Juan de Villanueva stood at the turning point between two eras, the absolutism of the Baroque and the beginning of the Enlightenment, Their work was seen as embodying the architectural idiom as it was handed down by the Academia de San Fernando."

5170,"VINCENT, François-André","(b. 1746, Paris, d. 1816, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vincent/biograph.html,"
French painter and draughtsman. He was one of the principal innovators in French art of the 1770s and 1780s, in the field of both Neoclassical subjects and themes from national history.

After studying with Joseph-Marie Vien in Paris Vincent had won the much-coveted Prix de Rome in 1768, remaining as a pupil in the École Royale des Éleves Protégés until July 1771 when he was installed as a pensionnaire in the Palais Mancini, Rome. During his Roman sojourn Vincent drew and painted a large number of portraits, both of his fellow students and Italian aristocrats (such as Monseigneur Ruffo in 1775). This portrait dates from a time in which Vincent's portraits are particularly close to Jean-Honoré Fragonard's, largely due to the latter's presence in Rome and Naples from December 1773 to June 1774."
5171,"VINCKBOONS, David","(b. 1576, Mechelen, d. ca. 1633, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vinckboo/biograph.html,"
Flemish-born painter, active in Amsterdam. He painted landscapes and genre scenes and is a transitional figure between the decorative and imaginative Mannerist tradition and the more naturalistic style associated with 17th-century Dutch painting. His early genre pictures depicting village festivals reveal the influence of Pieter Bruegel, and Vinckboons is credited with introducing some of his motifs into Holland. It has been asserted that Vinckboons's works can always be identified by the presence of a finch ('vinck') in a tree ('boom'), but the painstaking student usually finds that the bird has flown.

Dutch wood-carver. Although little is known about his life, he probably trained with his cabinetmaker father. His surviving body of work includes an oak pulpit in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam and a number of small, intricate boxwood reliefs. Vinckenbrinck usually signed his work with either the monogram AVB or ALVB.

Italian painter, also known as Bastiano Veronese. He was trained in his native Verona probably in the workshop of Domenico Brusasorci, but his work shows the influence of Paolo Veronese. In 1548 he settled in Pistoia and married there. His son, Jacopo Vini was also a painter."

From 1652 to 1655 van der Vinne travelled through Germany, Switzerland and France, accompanied some of the time by Guillam Dubois (c. 1610-80), Dirck Helmbreker and Cornelis Bega. During the trip van der Vinne kept an illustrated diary of his travels and on his return worked this up in a second volume, copying his drawings and adding topographical prints by Matthäus Merian the elder and Jean Boisseau. He also filled a sketchbook with Rhineland landscapes (Haarlem, Gemeentearchf). The year after he returned from this trip he married Anneke Jansdr de Gaver (d Feb 1668), and six months after her death he married Catalijntje Boekaert."

As a result of the French occupation of Genoa (1499-1508), he received a number of important commissions from French patrons and was therefore instrumental in introducing the Italian Renaissance style into France. There is, however, no evidence that he himself ever visited France."

Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He trained with Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini and was first mentioned as a painter in 1711. Visentini first earned fame with a volume of his drawings engraved by Vicenzo Mariotti (d 1734), his own work as an engraver dates from the end of the 1720s, when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith, with whom he had been in contact since 1717, to produce engravings of Canaletto's views of Venice; they were published in Prospectus magni canalis Venetiarum (Venice, 1735). From 1735 to the 1750s Visentini worked as an engraver. Vignettes and illustrations by his hand are to be found in many publications.

Dutch glass engraver. Her father, Roemer Visscher was a famous poet. According to tradition, he gave his daughter the rather unusual name of Tesselschade (i.e., Texel damage), because his ships had recently foundered in a storm off the coast of Texel. Her sister, Anna Roemers Visscher was also glass engraver and a talented poet.

Italian painter (originally Vitale d'Aimo de'Cavalli, also known as Vidolino or Vitale delle Madonne).

The earliest documentary references to Vitale concern S Francesco, Bologna, where he was paid for decorating a chapel in 1330 and where he witnessed deeds in 1334. He was probably born before 1309, since he would have been at least 25 to act as a witness. The earliest works attributed to him are the frescoes of standing saints and Abraham and the Blessed Souls (Bologna, S Martino), which show a strong Riminese influence in the cool, wine-red and olive tones and lean, high-cheeked faces."

Timoteo Viti (also called Timoteo da Urbino), Italian painter. He was the grandson of the painter Antonio Alberti; his father was also a painter. He was apprenticed to Francesco Francia in Bologna between 1490 and 1495; aspects of Viti's style would seem to confirm an apprenticeship in Bologna."

Only in 1698 was he received (reçu) at the Académie, as a pastellist, on presentation of portraits of the sculptor François Girardon and of the architect Robert de Cotte (both Paris, Louvre). Having been commissioned to execute a pastel Self-portrait (Florence, Uffizi) by Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, in 1699, the following year he was appointed the Elector's principal court painter. He henceforth divided his time between Paris, the Elector's courts at Brussels and Munich, and the court of Maximilian Emanuel's son, Clemens August, Elector of Cologne, at Bonn.

In 1694 he came second in the Prix de Rome competition with Lot and his Daughters Leaving Sodom (untraced); despite repeated attempts, he failed to win the first prize.

Dutch painter. He started as a history painter, and only later took up portraiture. He may have trained with Michiel van Miereveld about 1605. His Caravaggesque genre scenes dating from the mid-1620s shows influence by Utrecht Carravaggists such as Van Honthorst and Peter Wtewael (1596-1660) and by the Leiden painter Jan Lievens. Later on in his career he emphasised more classicist tendencies, subduing theatrics and action in favour of calm, timeless and stately compositions."

He originally came to St. Petersburg as an actor, although he was already a competent portraitist. In about 1780 he became the court painter of the heir to the throne, Grand Duke Pavel Petrovich (future Emperor Paul I of Russia). He painted several portraits of Paul, his wife Maria Fyodorovna, and other members of the Russian nobility, becoming one of the leading portraitists of the day in St. Petersburg."

Houbraken's remark that he turned idle after marrying a wealthy woman is belied by the large number of paintings he produced, both surviving and mentioned in inventories and sale catalogues, and by the fact that his wife, Maria van der Vecht, whom he married on 5 February 1656, was not rich.

After working in Venice making engravings of portraits and vedute based on paintings by sundry artists, he settled in Rome in 1772, where hi did some pages for the 'Schola Italica picturae' at the behest of Gavin Hamilton, and had some share in carrying out the colour engravings of Raphael's frescoes in the Stanze at the Vatican. Volpato's main contribution to the development of Neoclassical sculpture consisted in establishing and running a porcelain factory in Rome from 1786.Pope Pius VI had granted him the privilege of reproducing in porcelain the classical sculptures in the Vatican Museums.

Engraver and art dealer. part of a Dutch family of artists, active in Flanders. The family came from Zaltbommel, Gelderland. Lucas began to practise as an engraver when he was only 12 years old. He joined Rubens's studio c. 1617-18 and in 1620 became a master. Rubens clearly took on the sensitive young Vorsterman with a view to training him to reproduce his paintings, having realized the potential profits to be made from reproductive engravings of his work. Vorsterman's talent doubtless encouraged Rubens to intensify and guarantee his production of engravings by attaining exclusive licences in France, the northern Netherlands and the southern Spanish Netherlands. It is possible that the young Anthony van Dyck provided drawings after Rubens's paintings for the engravings by Vorsterman, although some have been attributed to Vorsterman himself or to the studio of Rubens."

In 1558 he was back in Antwerp where after the death of Frans Floris in 1570 he became the leading Italianate artist in that city. The altarpieces that make up the bulk of his output are typically Mannerist in their strained, slender elegance.

"
5230,"VOS, Simon de","(b. 1603, Antwerpen, d. 1676, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vos_s/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. In 1615 he became a pupil of Cornelis de Vos (no relation), with whom Jan Cossiers may have been a fellow-apprentice. By 1620 de Vos was a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. For the next eight years he may either have worked in Rubens's studio or have travelled abroad . The latter is more likely in view of the similarities between de Vos's oeuvre and that of Johann Liss, who was in Rome and Venice at that time. This hypothesis is supported by the italianizing characteristics evident in de Vos's early work.

Dutch painter. The son of a gold- and silversmith, he gave his age as twenty-four when he married in 1608. By that time he had travelled to Italy. His teacher is unknown, but his flower paintings reveal a close affinity with still-lifes by Jacob de Gheyn the Younger, who was active in The Hague. He was on the master list of the Delft painters' guild in 1613. In 1633 he served as headman of the guild together with Willem van der Vliet, and he was also a captain major of a civic-guard company."

Vouet was a leading French Baroque painter and an arbiter of taste for almost 20 years. The son of an artist, he settled in Italy in 1613, living chiefly in Rome, with periods in Genoa, Venice and Naples. His style shows an individual talent and a profound study of Italian painters, especially Veronese. Vouet soon enjoyed high favour, including the patronage of Pope Urban VIII. In 1627 he was invited back to France, where he became First Painter, a position challenged only once, in 1640-42, when he was brought into an artificial rivalry with Poussin. Vouet taught or collaborated with almost all the painters of the next generation in France, notably Le Brun, Le Sueur and Mignard. His portraits of the court of Louis XIII and most of his large-scale decorative schemes for Parisian houses and country chateaux have been destroyed.

The latter part of his life was principally occupied in making designs of architectural and other subjects for print-sellers, particularly Hieronymus Cock. Though an artist of many talents, it was through his engravings that he most influenced his contemporaries. The distribution of his works by the publishers of Antwerp made him one of the leading and best-known exponents of Mannerist decoration and the instigator of a new urban vision in northern and central Europe."

He trained with his father who was interested in perspective and painted mainly architectural paintings. He is known to have collaborated with his father in the completion of large assignments."
5237,"VREE, Nicolaes de","(b. 1645, Amsterdam, d. 1702, Alkmaar)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vree/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. According to Houbraken, he painted landscapes, flowers, thistles, and herbs. He was a pupil of Jan Wynants and he is known for his landscapes. In 1696 he moved to Alkmaar and in 1697 he became a member of the Alkmaar Guild of Saint Luke. He died in Alkmaar.



"
5238,"VREL, Jacobus",(active 1654-62 in Delft and Haarlem),https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vrel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Some 38 paintings, depicting domestic interiors, street scenes and a church interior, have been attributed to this enigmatic artist. Four copies after his works are possibly autograph; one drawing has also been ascribed to him. Over half of Vrel's paintings are signed or bear traces of signatures that were altered to read Johannes Vermeer or Pieter de Hooch, with whose paintings Vrel's work was often confused. Indeed, Theophile Thoré discussed Vermeer as a townscape painter largely on the basis of works that were actually by Vrel."
5239,"VRIES, Adriaen de","(b. ca. 1556, The Hague, d. 1626, Prague)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vries/biograph.html,"
Adriaen de Vries' career epitomizes the internationalism of the late Mannerist period. He was born in The Hague, trained in Italy, and worked mainly in Prague. His is the time-honored tradition of the itinerant artist, working for many of Europe's most discerning royal patrons. Little is known about de Vries until 1581, when he was an assistant in Giambologna's Florentine workshop. There he trained as a bronzeworker and absorbed much of Giambologna's sophisticated Mannerist style."
5240,"VRIES, Abraham de","(b. ca. 1590, Den Haag, d. ca. 1650, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vries_a/biograph.html,"
Dutch portrait painter. He was a peripatetic portraitist who worked in three countries and in Dutch cities with different traditions in portraiture. He is recorded in Rotterdam (1617), Aix-en-Provence (1623), Montpellier (1625), Bordeaux (1626), Paris (1626-1627), Antwerp (1628), Paris (1628-1629), Antwerp (1632), Amsterdam (1633), Paris (1634), Antwerp (1635), Paris (1635), Rotterdam (1639-1641), and The Hague (1644-1649)."
5241,"VRIES, Roelof van","(b. ca. 1630, Haarlem, d. after 1681, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vries_r/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, known for landscapes in the manner of more famous Haarlem landscapists such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Meindert Hobbema, Jan Wynants and Philips Wouwerman. He mostly signed his works as Rvries. He entered the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1657. He got married in Amsterdam in 1659, then 28 years old, and Reynier Hals was his witness."
5242,"VROOM, Cornelis Hendricksz. the Younger","(b. ca. 1591, Haarlem, d. 1661, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vroom/cornelis/biograph.html,"
Painter and draughtsman, part of a Dutch family of artists, son of Hendrick Vroom. He studied with his father and collaborated with him on the painting Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast (1617; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum); Cornelis provided the figures and the background. Only one signed marine painting by Cornelis is known, the Spanish Men-of-War Engaging Barbary Corsairs (1615; London, National Maritime Museum). The Battle of Lepanto (Ham House, Surrey, NT) is unsigned but plausibly attributed to him."
5243,"VROOM, Hendrick Cornelisz.","(b. 1566, Haarlem, d. 1640, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vroom/hendrick/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman, part of a family of artists. Cornelis Hendricksz. Vroom the Elder was a sculptor and ceramic artist, and his brother Frederick Vroom I (d. 1593) was city architect in Danzig (now Gdansk). Cornelis's son Hendrick Vroom initiated the Dutch 17th-century tradition of marine painting. His three sons - Cornelis Vroom the Younger, Frederick Vroom II (1600-1667) and Jacob Vroom I - all became painters, as did his grandson Jacob Vroom II (d. 1700), the son of Cornelis Vroom."
5244,"VUCHT, Jan van","(b. 1603, Rotterdam, d. 1637, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vucht/biograph.html,"
Jan van Vucht (also Johannes van der Vught), Dutch painter. He studied in Delft with the earliest known architectural painter in the Northern Netherlands, the renowned Bartholomeus van Bassen in c. 1622. In 1624 he was back in his native Rotterdam, where he married Annetge Gerrits Rentier (d. 1665). It is not known when he entered the Guild of Saint Luke of Rotterdam, but by the year 1627 he was settled as an independent master. In that year records identify him as the teacher of Anthonie de Lorme, who specialized in depicting realistic interiors of existing architectural structures."
5245,"VUILLARD, Édouard","(b. 1868, Cuiseaux, d. 1940, La Baule)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vuillard/biograph.html,"
French painter, printmaker, and decorator. He was the son of a retired army officer. The family moved to Paris in 1877 and Vuillard trained under Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts from 1886 and the Académie Julian from 1888. There he met Pierre Bonnard and other painters with whom he founded the Nabis in 1889 (the name derived from the Hebrew for prophet). The group, influenced by Gauguin and Degas, concentrated on pattern and distortion to emphasise psychological meanings beyond appearances in ordinary domestic subjects, though Bonnard and Vuillard returned by the end of the century to a more naturalistic style."
5246,"VUYSTINCK, Johannes",(active 1503-1523 in Utrecht),https://www.wga.hu/bio/v/vuystinc/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish goldsmith. He was the founding father of a large family of goldsmiths active in Utrecht and The Hague up to the end of the 17th century. No biographical data are available about him.



"
5247,"WAEL, Cornelis de","(b. 1592, Antwerpen, d. 1667, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wael/biograph.html,"
Painter, draughtsman and dealer, part of a Flemish family of artists and dealers, active in Italy. The brothers Lucas de Wael (1591-1661) and Cornelis de Wael were the sons of the painter Jan Baptist (Hans) de Wael I (1558-1633), from whom they learnt to paint. They both went to Italy c. 1610 and by 1613 had settled in Genoa. There Cornelis founded the Cenacolo Fiammingo, where he trained many young painters. Their circle of expatriate Flemings included Anthony van Dyck, who lived with them for a time and painted a double portrait of them (c. 1627; Rome, Museo Capitolino). Cornelis received commissions from Italian churches but is best known for his military pieces, harbour views and bambocciante or low-life subjects, whereas Lucas made a name for himself as a landscape painter. Jan Baptist de Wael II is primarily known as an etcher; he may also have worked in Italy."
5248,"WAGNER, Veit",(active 1492-1520 in Strasbourg),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wagner/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. In 1492 he worked for St George's Church, Haguenau, Alsace, and in 1495 he became a citizen of Strasbourg. He executed the great retable at Bergheim c. 1510. The large quantities of wood and stone sculptures that were produced suggest that he had a large workshop.



"
5249,"WAGNER, Joseph","(b. 1706, Thaldorf, d. 1780, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wagner_j/biograph.html,"
German engraver and print publisher, active in Italy. The pupil of Jacopo Amigoni, he was one of the leading mid-18th-century reproductive engravers active in Venice. As well as publishing engravings after such leading painters as Canaletto, he also worked on a two-volume set of engravings, Delle antiche statue greche e romane (1740-43), based on drawings of Classical statuary in Venice by Anton Maria Zanetti I (1680-1757) and Anton Maria Zanetti II (1706-1778). His workshop included such engravers as Francesco Bartolozzi and Antonio Baratti.



"
5250,"WAHL, Johann Salomon","(b. 1689, Chemnitz, d. 1765, København)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wahl/biograph.html,"
German painter, active in Denmark. He trained as a painter between 1705 and 1711 with David Hoyer (1667-1720), the court painter in Leipzig. In 1719 he settled in Hamburg, where he worked as a portrait painter of Holstein and Danish nobility. In 1722, he worked out of Hamburg for the Danish Royal Family."
5251,"WAILLY, Charles de","(b. 1729, Paris, d. 1798, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wailly/biograph.html,"
French architect, designer and painter. He Won the Grand Prix d'Architecture in 1752, and was pensionnaire of the French Academy in Rome from 1754 to 1756."
5252,"WAITT, Richard",(active 1706-1732),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/waitt/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter, active from c. 1706 and died in 1732. Waitt specialised in portraiture, but began his career as a decorative painter. His first recorded work is a coat of arms for the Earl of Hopetoun. He may have trained in the Edinburgh studio of the painter John Scougal (c. 1645-c. 1730) and seems to have produced several different types of painting, notably still-life. However later he painted primarily portraits, and for many years worked almost exclusively with the Clan Grant."
5253,"WALDMÜLLER, Fedinand Georg","(b. 1793, Wien, d. 1865, Wien)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/waldmull/biograph.html,"
One of the leading Austrian painters of the Biedermeier period. He studied at the Vienna Academy. He lived in Bratislava, then worked as a teacher of art in the house of Count Gyulay. After his return to Vienna, he copied pictures of old masters, and painted portraits, genre subjects, and still-life, but is perhaps best known for his landscapes, which in their loving attention to detail illustrate his belief that the close study of nature should be the basis of painting. He became the most significant representative of Biedermeier: he was second to none in depicting nature in delicate colours. His many genre-pictures are also significant."
5254,"WALDNER, Hans","(d. 1573, Austria)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/waldner/biograph.html,"
German cabinetmaker, born in Ravensburg, active in Austria. His first recorded work is the choir-stalls (1562-65) of the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, for which he received 30 florins. From January 1566 he received correspondence from Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (reg 1564-95) regarding work at Schloss Ambras, Tyrol, which had just been completed, relating mainly to furnishing the chapel and room panelling. However, immediately after the Archduke's death all this woodwork was removed to Günzburg, and nothing more is known about it."
5255,"WALKER, George","(b. 1781, Killingbeck Hall, Seacroft, d. 1856, Killingbeck Lodge, Seacroft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walker/biograph.html,"
British painter. His father, William Walker, was a successful businessman in Leeds. After being educated in York, Walker became an artist. At first he concentrated on local, rural landscapes. Walker developed a reputation as a good artist and in 1814 and a local bookseller commissioned a series of paintings for the book Costume of Yorkshire. The book contained forty pictures of local people including: The Horse Dealer, Cloth Makers, The Collier, The Cloth Dresser, Stone Breakers, The Milk Boy, Whalebone Scrapers, Wensley Dale Knitters, Leech Finders, Sheffield Cutler and Factory Children. The book also included the first ever painting of a locomotive."
5256,"WALKER, Robert",(1599-1658),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walker_r/biograph.html,"
English painter. He was a favoured portraitist of the Parliamentarian leaders during the Commonwealth and Protectorate (1649-1658), working mostly for Oliver Cromwell and his immediate circle. He is noted for his austere and direct portraits, relying heavily on van Dyck's portrait formulas. He was also influenced by Italian painting. He also was a successful copyist of Italian masters.



"
5257,"WALPOLE, Horace","(b. 1717, London, d. 1797, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walpole/biograph.html,"
English aristocrat, amateur architect, the youngest son of the prime minister Sir Robert Walpole. He was an art historian, man of letters, antiquarian, and politician. He was famous in his day for his medieval horror tale The Castle of Otranto, which initiated the vogue for Gothic romances. He is remembered today as perhaps the most assiduous letter writer in the English language."
5258,"WALS, Goffredo","(b. ca. 1600, Köln, d. ca. 1639, Calabria)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wals/biograph.html,"
German painter, draughtsman and printmaker, active in Italy. According to early sources, Wals left Cologne at the tender age of fourteen and ventured to Italy. In Naples he found work colouring engravings, while from 1616 or 1617 until the end of November 1618, he worked in the Roman studio of Agostino Tassi. Further information about his career is scarce. However, Filippo Baldinucci tells how Wals's fame as a painter of landscapes and perspectives encouraged Claude Lorrain to study with him in Naples, probably from 1620-22. Claude's time with Wals was instrumental in his development of the idealised Italianate landscape."
5259,"WALSCAPELLE, Jacob van","(b. 1644, Dordrecht, d. 1727, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walscape/biograph.html,"
Dutch still-life painter, the pupil of Cornelis Kick. His original name was Jacobus Cruydenier, but he adopted his maternal great-grandfather's surname van Walscapelle. He was probably trained in Dordrecht and the mention of an architectural painting by van Walscapelle in a 1729 Dordrecht inventory suggests that he did not start out as a still-life painter. Today, however, we know no paintings by him of other subjects than still-lifes. Around the mid-1660s, he is known to have been a pupil of the still-life painter Cornelis Kick in Amsterdam and indeed his early flower paintings can barely be discerned from his teacher's. In 1673, he entered the service of the Amsterdam drapers' hall and Arnold Houbraken, writing in the early eighteenth century, claimed that he soon gave up painting in favour of his municipal job. The range of his known dated works (1667 up to 1685) seemed to confirm that statement, until a recently-surfaced, rather elaborate example of his work dated 1699 provided evidence to the contrary."
5260,"WALSCHARTZ, François","(b. ca. 1596, Liège, d. ca. 1678, Liège)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walschar/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. Son of a goldsmith from Antwerp who settled in Liège, François Walschartz is one of the major representatives of the Liège school of painting in the 17th century. At a time when the school of Rubens and Flemish art shine brightly, the artists of the school of Liège are more attracted by what is done in Italy and France. Within this school, François Walschartz has the distinction of having fed in Antwerp, for two years, the style of Rubens, before retaining only the lessons of Caravaggio."
5261,"WALTHER, Friedrich",(c. 1440-c. 1495),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walther/biograph.html,"
German painter and draftsman. He worked in Dinkelsbühl, Nördlingen, Cannstatt, and Konstanz, where he is last documented. In 1474 he is mentioned as a member of a workshop cooperative with Friedrich Herlin in Nördlingen, with whom he developed close stylistic affinities. His artistic identity depends largely on a panel painting in Bern depicting St Wendelin with the donatrix Barbara Strauss of Nördlingen that is signed FW and dated 1467.



"
5262,"WALTON, Edward Arthur","(b. 1860, Renfrew, d. 1922, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/walton/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He trained at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf (1876-77) and Glasgow School of Art. One of the Glasgow Boys (a group of Scottish painters  who was interpreting and expanding the canon of Impressionist and Post-impressionist painting), he painted outdoors in the Trossachs and at Crowland, Lincs, with James Guthrie, Joseph Crawhall and George Henry. He also painted in William York Macgregor's life studio in Glasgow. He joined the New English Art Club in 1887 and developed an atmospheric landscape style influenced by plein-air painting and by James McNeill Whistler with whom he was friendly during his stay in London (1894-1904); Autumn Sunshine (1884; University of Glasgow, Hunterian Art Gallery) is characteristic."
5263,"WARD, James","(b. 1769, London, d. 1859, Cheshunt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/ward/biograph.html,"
English painter and engraver. Until about the end of the century he painted mainly anecdotal genre scenes in the manner of his brother-in-law George Morland, but he then turned to the paintings of animals in landscape settings for which he is remembered. They are often dramatic and Romantic in character and their rich colouring was influenced by Rubens (Bulls Fighting, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, c. 1804). His taste for natural grandeur and the Sublime often led him to work on a large scale, as in the enormous Gordale Scar (Tate Gallery, London, 1811-15). Ward had many admirers, including Delacroix and Géricault, but he lived in retirement from the 1830s and ended his life in poverty. His brother William (1766-1826) was an engraver.



"
5264,"WARE, Isaac","(b. 1704, London, d. 1766, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/ware/biograph.html,"
English architect. He was born to a life of poverty, living as a street urchin, until he was adopted by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington at the age of eight, after which he was groomed and educated as a young nobleman. Burlington, recognising his talent, intelligence and personality, took him into his own household. His subsequent education included a Grand Tour of Europe and the study of architecture."
5265,"WARIN, Jean","(b. 1607, Liège, d. 1672, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/warin/biograph.html,"
Jean Warin (Varin), French sculptor, medallist and painter. He was one of the most eminent French medallists and a sculptor of considerable reputation during the first half of the 17th century. He trained in the Liège workshop of his father, the medallist and chaser Jean Warin. By 1615 the family had left Liège, perhaps for Sedan, and by 1625 Warin was in Paris, where in 1629, having renounced his Protestantism, he took part charge of the Monnaie du Moulin during the minority of the heirs of the Olivier family, its hereditary owners. Having secured his position by marrying their widowed mother, he took charge of the studio of the Lyon mint around 1642-43, and in 1646 he was appointed Tailleur Général des Monnaies de France, to which in the following year he added the office of Contrôleur Général des Poinçons et Effigies des Monnaies de France."
5266,"WASMANN, Friedrich","(b. 1805, Hamburg, d. 1886, Meran)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wasmann/biograph.html,"
German painter. He was trained in Dresden and Munich, and spent several years in Rome, where he met famous artists such as Friedrich Overbeck, Joseph Anton Koch, Bertel Thorvaldsen and others. Returning to Germany in 18139 he settled in Meran where he worked as a portrait painter."
5267,"WATERHOUSE, John William","(b. 1849, Roma, d. 1917, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/waterhou/biograph.html,"
English painter. His father was a minor English painter working in Rome. Waterhouse entered the Royal Academy Schools in London in 1870. He exhibited at the Society of British Artists from 1872 and at the Royal Academy from 1874. From 1877 to the 1880s he regularly travelled abroad, particularly to Italy. In the early 1870s he had produced a few uncharacteristic Orientalist 'keepsake' paintings, but most of his works in this period are scenes from ancient history or classical genre subjects, similar to the work of Lawrence Alma-Tadema (e.g. Consulting the Oracle, c. 1882; London, Tate). However, Waterhouse consistently painted on a larger scale than Alma-Tadema. His brushwork is bolder, his sunlight casts harsher shadows and his history paintings are more dramatic."
5268,"WATERLOO, Anthonie","(b. 1609, Ryssel, d. 1690, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/waterloo/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and printmaker. Little is known of his early life and, as no records of any formal training as an artist have been discovered, he may well have been self-taught. Although registered as a painter, he had little success in selling his own canvases and, apparently, supported himself through his activities as an art dealer in addition to sales of his drawings and prints."
5269,"WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine","(b. 1684, Valenciennes, d. 1721, Nogent-sur-Marne)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/watteau/antoine/biograph.html,"
The greatest French painter of his period and one of the key figures of Rococo art. He was born at Valenciennes, which had passed to France from the Spanish Netherlands only six years before his birth, and he was regarded by contemporaries as a Flemish painter. There are indeed strong links with Flanders in his art, but it also has a sophistication that is quintessentially French."
5270,"WATTEAU, Louis-Joseph","(b. 1731, Valenciennes, d. 1798, Lille)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/watteau/louis/biograph.html,"
French painter, the nephew  of Antoine Watteau. He and his son François-Louis-Joseph (1758-1823) were both known as 'Watteau de Lille'. Louis was born in Valenciennes but went to Lille in 1755 and taught drawing from the nude there: this caused such a scandal that he had to resign and did not return until 1775. He did not always imitate his uncle's works, often painting histories or religious pictures. His son worked in a style closer to his great-uncle's, and, like him, was influenced by Teniers.


"
5271,"WATTS, Frederick Waters","(b. 1800, Bath, d. 1870, Hampstead)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/watts/biograph.html,"
English painter, known also as Frederick William (or Frederick W.) Watts. Little is known about his life. He was a landscape painter influenced by Constable. In 1817 he entered the Royal Academy in London, and won silver medals there between 1819-21. He exhibited at the academy from 1821-60, and at the British Institution from 1823-62."
5272,"WEBB, James","(b. ca. 1825, Chelsea, d. 1895, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/webb/biograph.html,"
English painter specialised in marine views and landscapes. He spent the majority of his career in London, exhibiting regularly at the Royal Academy between 1853 and 1888, as well as at the British Institution, Suffolk Street, the New Watercolour Society and Grosvenor Gallery. Webb was a pupil of Clarkson Frederick Stanfield. His father Archibald Webb and his brother Byron Webb were also noted painters."
5273,"WEBB, Philip Speakman","(b. 1831, Oxford, d. 1915, Worth, Sussex)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/webb1/biograph.html,"
English architect and designer, especially known for his unconventional country houses, who was a pioneer figure in the English domestic revival movement."
5274,"WEBBER, John","(b. 1751, London, d. 1793, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/webber/biograph.html,"
English painter of Swiss descent. He was the son of the Swiss sculptor Abraham Wäber, who had moved to London in the early 1740s. In 1757 Webber was sent to Berne for his education: from 1767 to 1770 he was apprenticed to the landscape painter and printmaker Johann Ludwig Aberli, who specialized in mountain and lake views, executed in delicate watercolour and grey wash. From 1770 Webber studied at the Académie Royale in Paris, where he learnt to paint in oil (e.g. Portrait of a Sculptor, early 1770s; Berne, Kunstmuseum). In 1773 and 1774 he toured the countryside around Paris with the engraver Jean Georges Wille, making chalk sketches of picturesque hovels in a hatched, fussy style. Webber's rural landscapes of this period frequently include a genre element, as can be seen in the pen, brush and watercolour drawing of An Amorous Encounter at a Well (1773; Frankfurt am Main, Städelshe Kunstinstitut); this awareness of human incident was to be an important element of his subsequent work."
5275,"WEBER, Henrik","(b. 1818, Pest, d. 1866, Pest)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weber/biograph.html,"
Hungarian painter. He was T. Kaerling's pupil in Pest, then Leopold Kupelwieser's and Johann Ender's in Vienna. He lived on private lessons and lithographs. He painted genre lives in the 1830s (Dressing the Bride, Palm Sunday, etc.). He went to Munich in 1840. On his return to Hungary, he painted several historic pictures (János Hunyadi's Death, 1844, King Solomon in Prison, 1852, etc.). He visited Italy in 1845-47 where he painted vedutas and women in folk dress. He was a notable portraitist of his period (Composer Mihály Mosonyi and his Wife, Pest Citizen).



"
5276,"WEBER, Giovanni Zanobio","(b. 1737, Firenze, d. 1806, Firenze)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weber_z/biograph.html,"
Giovanni Zanobio Weber was an Italian medallist. He was the son of a German (or Austrian) officer of the Grand Duke of Tuscany's bodyguard. He worked mostly in Florence, the period of his greatest activity being between 1761 and 1786."
5277,"WECKMANN, Niklaus",(active 1481-1528 in Ulm),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weckmann/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. His name appears several times in the roll book of burghers of Ulm between 1481 and 1526. In 1490 he was commissioned to produce a high altarpiece for St Martin's church, Biberach, similar in construction and appearance to those at Sterzingen and Blaubeuren. This, his major work, was destroyed during the iconoclasm of 1531. Its eight painted Passion scenes were once thought to be by Martin Schongauer."
5278,"WEEKES, Henry","(b. 1807. Canterbury, d. 1877, Ramsgate)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weekes/biograph.html,"
English sculptor. He was apprenticed to William Behnes in 1822 and studied at the Royal Academy (1823-26), winning a silver medal for sculpture in 1826. In 1827 he became an assistant to Francis Chantrey, with whom he remained until the latter's death in 1841; he then took over Chantrey's studio and completed his unfinished works, including the bronze equestrian statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1841-44; London, Royal Exchange)."
5279,"WEEKS, Edwin Lord","(b. 1849, Boston, d. 1903, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weeks/biograph.html,"
American painter. He was a disciple of Léon Bonnat and Jean-Léon Gérôme who became America's most prominent painter of North African Orientalist genre scenes."
5280,"WEENIX, Jan Baptist","(b. 1621, Amsterdam, d. 1660, Doetinchem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weenix/jan_fath/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, a pupil of Bloemaert who was in Italy 1642-46 and returned, calling himself ""Giovanni Battista"", to Holland to paint Italianate landscapes with ruins of ancient buildings and figures in modern dress, very reminiscent of the work of Berchem, who is said to have been his cousin. Later in life he changed his style entirely and painted still-life and some portraits, his very detailed style being continued by his son Jan.

5281,"WEENIX, Jan","(b. 1642, Amsterdam, d. 1719, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weenix/jan_son/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the son of Jan Baptist Weenix, and was his father's pupil with his cousin Hondecoeter. He never visited Italy, but he painted Italianate scenes like his father's and pursued more single-mindedly the still-life with flowers, animals and dead game subjects which he also took over from his father. He worked mainly in Amsterdam, but also at Bensberg and Düsseldorf for the Elector Palatine, for whom he executed a huge series of still-lifes (1702-12). There are works in Amsterdam (Rijksmuseum), Augsburg, Barnsley, Cape Town, Dresden, The Hague, London, Munich, New York (Metropolitan Museum), Oxford, Paris (Petit Palais), Toronto and elsewhere.



"
5282,"WEIDITZ, Christoph","(b. ca. 1500, Freiburg im Breisgau, d. 1559, Augsburg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weiditz/biograph.html,"
Medallist, sculptor, goldsmith, member of a German family of artists active in the Upper Rhine region from the mid-15th century to the mid-16th. From 1523 to 1525 he worked in Strasbourg, from 1525 to 1526 in Swabia, and from 1526 to 1529 in Augsburg. He travelled to Spain and to the Low Countries in the retinue of Emperor Charles V. In 1532 he returned to Augsburg."
5283,"WEIDMANN, Leonhard",(active 1568-1596 in Rothenburg ob der Tauber),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weidmann/biograph.html,"
German mason and master builder. In 1568, when he became a citizen of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, he was paid for a plan to rebuild the Renaissance wing of the Town Hall, on which work began in 1570. Opinions vary concerning the extent to which Weidmann's scheme was followed, as he did not qualify as a master craftsman until 1575. The Town Hall, one of the finest in Franconia, reconciles the traditional high gabled façade with the heavily stressed horizontals of the long side elevation, exposed to the Market Square, by locating a three-storey oriel at the angle. Weidmann's work is seen in the Gothic wing, too, where he carved the bar in the courtroom."
5284,"WEINBRENNER, Johann Jakob Friedrich","(b. 1766, Karlsruhe, d. 1826, Karlsruhe)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weinbren/biograph.html,"
German architect and city planner. He was the most important architect working in southwest Germany in the first quarter of the 19th century."

German apothecary and botanist, noted for his creation of the florilegium Phytanthoza iconographia between 1737 and 1745, an ambitious project which resulted in eight folio volumes with more than 1.000 hand-coloured engravings of several thousand plants."
5286,"WEIR, Julian Alden","(b. 1852, West Point, d. 1919, New York)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weir/biograph.html,"
American painter, printmaker and teacher, part of a family of artists, son of Robert Walter Weir (1803-1889). His art education began in the studio of his father. There he and his half-brother John Ferguson Weir (1841-1926) acquired an appreciation for the Old Masters, particularly of the Italian Renaissance and of the 17th-century Dutch schools. While Weir pursued in his art a course very different from that of his father and half-brother, his personality as well as his artistic attitudes were shaped by them. In the winters of 1870-71 and 1871-72, he continued his studies at the National Academy of Design in New York, where his instructor was Lemuel Wilmarth (1835-1918). He continued his studies in 1873 in Paris under Gérôme. He practiced open air painting in Pont-Aven (Brittany) and Cernay-la-Ville, southwest of Paris. He became friends with Bastien-Lepage and Sargent. In 1875 he exhibited at the Paris Salon and the New York National Academy of Design."
5287,"WEISGERBER, Albert","(b. 1878, Sankt Ingbert, d. 1915, Fromelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weisgerb/biograph.html,"
German painter and printmaker. He studied decoration at the Kreisbaugewerksschule in Kaiserlautern (1891-93) and began work in a decorator's studio in Frankfurt am Main. However, in 1894 he moved to Munich to resume his studies, first at the Kunstgewerbeschule and later under Franz von Stuck at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste (1897-1901). For some years he concentrated on poster design and book illustration, contributing a total of 500 drawings to Jugend - Müncher Illustrierte Wochenschrift für Kunst und Leben from 1899."
5288,"WEISS, Bartholomeus Ignaz","(b. ca. 1740, München, d. 1814, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weiss/biograph.html,"
German painter, etcher, and miniaturist. After an early training by his father, Franz Joseph Weiss (1735-1790), as a porcelain painter, Bartholomaus Ignaz Weiss worked for five years between 1764 and 1769 at the Nymphenburg factory. In 1769 he was awarded a scholarship to further his studies in the Schleissheim galleries and in 1771 he became a student of Franz Ignazius Oefele (1721-1797) at the newly founded Drawing School in Munich, which later became the Munich Academy. One of the founders of the Drawing School was Thomas Christian Winck (1738-1797)."
5289,"WEISSENBRUCH, Jan Hendrik","(b. 1824, Den Haag, d. 1903, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weissenb/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, part of a family of artists, cousin of Jan Weissenbruch. He referred to himself and signed his work as Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch."

German cabinetmaker. He was a Paris-based cabinetmaker whose neoclassical-style furniture, often set with lacquer or decorative panels, found favour at several European royals courts, including George IV's (1762-1830)."
5291,"WELSCH, Maximilian von","(b. 1671, Kronach, d. 1745, Mainz)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/welsch/biograph.html,"
German architect. He is regarded as a prominent representative of Baroque fortress building in the Holy Roman Empire. Besides this he got reputation with the construction of several palaces."
5292,"WENTZINGER, Johann Christian","(b. 1710, Ehrenstetten im Breisgau, d. 1797, Freiburg im Breisgau)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wentzing/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, stuccoist, and painter. After his trip to Italy in 1731, he spent the period between 1735 and 1737 at the Paris Académie des Beaux-Arts before setting up in business as an artist in the Breisgau area. Influenced partly by Italian terracotta work, he used the amorphous material of clay to achieve a more direct realization of his sculptural ideas. At the same time, this led him to produce models or maquettes."
5293,"WERENSKIOLD, Erik","(b. 1855, Eidskog, d. 1938, Oslo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/werenski/biograph.html,"
Norwegian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He studied in Christiania (later Kristiania, now Oslo) in 1873-75 under Julius Middelthun (1820-1886), who discovered his unusual gift for drawing, and then at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich (1876-79). Among his early paintings, Female Half-nude (1877; Bergen, Billedgalleri) is typical in revealing an interest in individual personality and psychology even in a traditional academic subject. In 1878, while on a visit to Kristiania, Werenskiold met the collector and editor Peter Christien Asbjørnsen (1812-1885) and was engaged as an illustrator for his new edition of Norwegian fairy tales (Kristiania, 1879). Together with Theodor Kittelsen (1857-1914), he continued to contribute illustrations to Absjørnsen's publications. In his drawings for tales such as 'The three princesses in the mountain-in-the-blue' (Kristiania, 1887), he achieved a striking combination of realistic observation, fantasy and humour, his imaginary creatures being especially successful."
5294,"WERFF, Adriaen van der","(b. 1659, Kralingen, d. 1722, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/werff/adriaen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of religious and mythological scenes and portraits, active mainly in Rotterdam. At the age of ten he started to take lessons, two years later moving in with Eglon van der Neer, specializing in clothes and draperie. At the age of seventeen he founded his own studio in Rotterdam where he later became the head of guild of Saint Luke."
5295,"WERFF, Pieter van der","(b. 1665, Kralingen, d. 1722, Rotterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/werff/pieter/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was the younger brother, assistant and close follower of Adriaen van der Werff. He imitated his brother's style closely and made many copies of his work. He is best known for his portraits. In the 1690s he painted a portrait of Czar Peter the Great (now in the Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg). Many of his works - including a series of busts of the administrators of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC)- are now part of the collections of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.



"
5296,"WERNER, Joseph the Younger","(b. 1637, Bern, d. 1710, Bern)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/werner/biograph.html,"
Swiss painter, miniaturist and engraver. He first studied painting with his father, also named Joseph Werner, a little known artist. He then worked in the studio of Matthäus Merian the Younger in Frankfurt and went to Rome where he copied works by Pietro da Cortona and Andrea Sacchi and produced miniature paintings. He travelled to France where, at the court of Louis XIV he painted portraits of both the monarch himself and of various notables in his entourage; he also worked on the decorations of the Palace of Versailles."
5297,"WERTINGER, Hans","(b. ca. 1465, Landshut, d. 1533, Landshut)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wertinge/biograph.html,"
German painter and woodcutter. An artist as ambitious as Lucas Cranach the Elder, he became one of Germany's first accredited court painters, working for the Dukes of Landshut in the triangular area defined by Ingolstadt, Straubing and Munich. The son of a functionary working for the Dukes, he was probably first taught by a certain Sigmund Gleismüller (c. 1449-1511). Hans Mair (Mair von Landshut), who had come from Augsburg and had settled in Landshut, seems to have prompted him to work as a journeyman in Augsburg. His acquisition of citizen's rights in Landshut in 1491 suggests he was a master by that date."
5298,"WESEL, Adriaen van","(b. ca. 1417, Utrecht, d. 1499, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wesel/biograph.html,"
Netherlandish sculptor who lived and worked in his native town Utrecht. He became one of Utrecht's leading citizens, a major figure in the militia and the town council. He is considered to have been one of the principal artists of the Northern Netherlands. "

He was historical painter to George III (1772-1801), a founder of the Royal Academy (1768), and in 1792 he succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as its president.

"
5300,"WESTALL, Richard","(b. 1765, Hertford, d. 1836, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/westall/biograph.html,"
English painter and illustrator. He was apprenticed in 1799 to John Thompson, a heraldic engraver in London. The miniaturist John Alefounder (d. 1795) advised Westall to take up painting, and in 1784 he exhibited a portrait drawing (untraced) at the Royal Academy. He became a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1785, an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1792 and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1794."
5301,"WESTERHOLM, Victor Axel","(b. 1860, Turku, d. 1919, Turku)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/westerho/biograph.html,"
Finnish painter. He studied at the School of Drawing in Turku from 1869 to 1878. In 1878 he travelled to Düsseldorf and enrolled at the Kunstakademie, where he attended classes on landscape painting by Eugen Dücker (1841-1916) until 1886. He spent his summers in Finland, on the Aland Islands, preparing sketches that provided the groundwork for many of the paintings he produced in Düsseldorf. Although Westerholm began working according to the principles of studio painting, his vivid studies are often imbued with the crispness of the plein-air style. In the early 1880s he concentrated on painting autumnal scenes and rapidly became the leading landscape artist of the younger generation."
5302,"WESTMACOTT, Sir Richard","(1775, London, d. 1856, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/westmaco/biograph.html,"
Neoclassical sculptor, part of an English family of sculptors. They were leading sculptors of funerary monuments in the 18th and 19th centuries and also specialized in chimney-pieces and other forms of architectural sculpture. "

5304,"WET, Jacob Willemsz. de, the Elder","(b. ca. 1610, Haarlem, d. 1675, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wet_j/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter and draughtsman. It seems unlikely that he is the same as the Jacobus de Wit who was a member of the Alkmaar Guild of St Luke in 1637 or as the Jan de Wet (b Hamburg, c. 1617) who was a pupil of Rembrandt. Sumowski has disentangled his work from that of Gerrit de Wet, Daniel Thievaert (1613-57) and of his own son, Jacob de Wet the younger (b Haarlem, c. 1640; d Amsterdam, 11 Nov 1697)."
5305,"WEYDEN, Goswijn van der","(b. ca. 1465, Bruxelles, d. after 1538, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/weyden/goossen/biograph.html,"Flemish painter, grandson of Rogier van der Weyden. He became a burgher of the town of Lier in 1497 and from 1499 executed various works for the abbey of Tongerloo. Around 1500 he settled in Antwerp, where he directed a flourishing workshop employing several apprentices. That year he also joined the Guild of St Luke, of which he was made Dean in 1514 and 1530. Several paintings are attributed to Goswijn: a cycle of eight panels (of which seven have survived) on the Life of St Dimpna (private collection), part of a large altarpiece executed c. 1505 for the abbey church of Tongerloo, the altarpiece of the Marriage of the Virgin (known as the 'Colibrant Triptych'), painted c. 1515–17 for the church of Sint Gommarus in Lier, and a Virgin and Child with a Donor Couple (also known as the 'Kalmthout Donation' c. 1511–15).

5307,"WHEATLEY, Francis","(b. 1747, London, d. 1801, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wheatley/biograph.html,"
English painter. He trained at William Shipley's Academy in London. In 1762, 1763 and 1765 he won prizes for drawing from the Society of Artists, and in 1769 he enrolled in the newly established Royal Academy Schools. He is recorded as having studied under a Mr Wilson in 1762; this may have been the portrait painter Benjamin Wilson or, less likely, the landscape painter Richard Wilson."

American painter, printmaker, and designer, active in England. Dismissed from West Point, Whistler joined the US navy, where as a cartographer he learned etching and decided on a career in art. He went to Paris in 1855 before settling in London in 1859, where he enjoyed an early success, not only for his art but also for his flamboyant life-style."
5309,"WHITCOMBE, Thomas","(b. ca. 1752, London, d. ca. 1824, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/whitcomb/biograph.html,"
English marine painter. He painted mainly marine and topographical subjects, specializing in the naval vessels and battles of the Napoleonic Wars. His greatest preoccupation was recording the ships and sea battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, during which British naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, and the victories of the British fleet at battles such as the Nile, Camperdown, and Trafalgar, constantly thwarted Napoleon's ambitions. "
5310,"WIDERIN, Peter","(b. 1684, Stanz, d. 1760, Sankt Pölten)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/widerin/biograph.html,"

Dutch draughtsman, painter, etcher and navigator. His name first appears in the Haarlem records in 1597. It is generally assumed that he was a pupil of Hendrick Vroom, whose work strongly influenced his own. Documentary sources confirm that he maintained close friendships with both Hendrick Goltzius, who made woodcuts after his drawings, and Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem."

Hieronymus (also Jerome) Wierix, Flemish engraver and brother of Jan Wierix. When his father died, Hieronymus was entrusted to Jerome Manacker. He began his training by making accurate copperplates engravings after Dürer, much as his brother had. Hieronymus Wierix is especially known for his very delicate religious prints on a very small scale."
5314,"WIERIX, Jan","(b. 1549, Antwerpen, d. ca. 1618, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wierix/jan/biograph.html,"
Flemish engraver, draughtsman and publisher, part of a family of artists. Presumably as part of his early training, in 1563 and 1565 he made copies of engravings after Dürer and other artists. His first dated prints were published as early as 1568. By the following year he was employed by Christoph Plantin, to whom he introduced his brother Hieronymus Wierix in 1570. At the time Jan was living in the Lombaardevest, amid many other booksellers and engravers. He worked for Plantin's publishing house, the Officina Plantiniana, more often than Hieronymus, and already in 1570 and 1571 Plantin paid Jan's drinking debts. From then onwards Jan's name appears regularly in Plantin's accounts and letters.

5315,"WIERTZ, Antoine","(b. 1806, Dinant, d. 1865, Bruxelles)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wiertz/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter and sculptor. He was from very humble origins, but his talent for drawing was detected at an early age. He was sent to the Antwerp Academie, where he attended classes given by Willem Herreyns and Mathieu Ignace Van Brée. During a stay in Paris from 1829 to 1832 he came into contact with the Romantic painters, in particular Théodore Géricault, who fostered his admiration for Rubens."
5316,"WIJNEN, Domenicus van","(b. 1661, Amsterdam, d. 1698, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wijnen/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. Little is known about his life. He was a pupil of the painter and engraver Willem Doudijns (1630-1697) in The Hague. He lived in Rome between 1680 and 1690, where he joined the Bentvueghels, also known as the Schildersbent, a society of Netherlandish artists in Rome. Upon his initiation into the Schildersbent he was given the bent name 'Ascanius', a reference to the son of the Trojan hero Aeneas."
5317,"WIJNTRACK, Dirck","(b. 1615, Heusden, d. 1678, Den Haag)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wijntrac/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was sibling by marriage (in-law) of Ludolf de Jongh. He is known for his paintings of wildfowl and there is evidence that he often worked with Jan Wynants and Joris van der Haagen on landscape paintings during the 1650s."
5318,"WILD, James William","(b. 1814, Lincoln, d. 1892, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wild/biograph.html,"
English architect. Initially working in the Gothic style, he later employed round-arched forms. In 1840, he was commissioned to build a new church at Streatham on a limited budget. He abandoned the medieval English styles he had used for his earlier churches, for a design in a spare, round-arched style, based on an eclectic range of sources from around the Mediterranean."
5319,"WILDENS, Jan","(b. 1586, Antwerpen, d. 1653, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wildens/biograph.html,"
Flemish landscape painter born in Antwerp, where he became a master in 1604. He is best known for painting landscape backgrounds for Rubens and for many artists in his circle, but his finest independent work - Winter Landscape with a Hunter (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, 1624) - shows he was an accomplished master in his own right.

Wiligelmo (also known as Wiligelmus, Guglielmo da Modena), Italian sculptor active in Modena. He was the first sculptor in Italy who started again to produce large size sculptures and signed his work."
5321,"WILKIE, Sir David","(b. 1785, Cults, Fife, d. 1841, off Malta)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wilkie/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter. He was trained in Edinburgh and then in 1805 moved to London, where he studied at the Royal Academy Schools. His Village Politicians (private collection) was the hit of the Royal Academy exhibition of 1806 and he established himself as the most popular genre painter of the day. He was strongly influenced in technique and subject-matter by 17th-century Netherlandish artists such as 0stade and Teniers, and the public loved the wealth of lively and often humorous incident in his paintings."
5322,"WILKINS, William the Younger","(b. 1778, Norwich, d. 1839, Cambridge)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wilkins/biograph.html,"
English architect, writer, and collector, son of the architect William Wilkins the Elder (1751-1815). Educated at Cambridge, he became acquainted with Greek and Italian architecture during his travels (1801-04). He set up his office in London in 1809 and quickly established himself as a leading figure of the Greek Revival. He designed the first pure Greek Doric portico for any English country-house at Osberton House, Nottinghamshire (c. 1805, demolished). This was followed by the East India (now Haileybury) College, Hertfordshire (1806-09), and then Downing College, Cambridge (1807-20), both early and important buildings of the Greek Revival. In the latter case, where Wilkins's scheme was selected instead of James Wyatt's Neoclassical design, Thomas Hope (1769-1831) was the chief protagonist in promoting the Grecian style. Downing was the first of all university campuses, or separate buildings disposed around a grassed area."

Painter, member of a Dutch family of painters, son of Adam Willaerts. After training with his father he later studied with Jan van Bijlert in Utrecht and with Simon Vouet in Paris. In 1624 he became a master of the Utrecht Guild of St Luke; from 1637 to 1644 he was in Brazil in the entourage of Count John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, and in 1659 he visited Naples and Rome. He and his younger brother, Isaac, took up their father's profession and became marine painters."

Painter, member of a Dutch family of painters. The marine painter Adam Willaerts was one of the many Protestants who emigrated from Flanders to the northern Netherlands at the end of the 16th century. He had three sons who became painters, at least two of whom, Abraham Willaerts and Isaac Willaerts, studied with him and painted marine subjects as well as portraits. Unlike his father and younger brothers, the eldest son Cornelis Willaerts (1600-66) was a history painter who also painted portraits and landscapes, including Arcadian scenes in the manner of Cornelis van Poelenburch. He remains a shadowy figure, by whom only one signed work is known."
5325,"WILLAERTS, Isaac","(b. ca. 1620, Utrecht, d. 1693, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/willaert/isaac/biograph.html,"
Painter, member of a Dutch family of painters, son of Adam Willaerts. In 1637 he was a master, and in 1666 the dean, of the Utrecht Guild. His mediocre coastal scenes are derived from his father's but are more loosely painted (e.g. Marine Scene with Rocky Coast and Ruin, Utrecht, Central Museum). He also followed his father in contributing marine backgrounds to Ormea's still-lifes of fish. His paintings of southern ports resemble those of his brother Abraham Willaerts.

5326,"WILLE, Johann Georg","(b. 1715, Obermühle am Dünsberg, d. 1808, Paris)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wille/biograph.html,"
German engraver. He learned to engrave as a youthful apprentice to a gunmaker. His talents were soon recognized and in 1736 he was sent to Paris to engrave some plates after Rigaud. Most of Wille's early art was in the genre of portrait engraving. By 1750, however, Wille had established himself as a leading engraver of historical and genre subjects, particularly after the designs of contemporary Dutch and German painters. Wille's unsurpassed ability to render form and texture earned him many honours. During his career he was awarded the lucrative titles of Engraver to the King of France, Engraver to the Emperor of Germany and Engraver to the King of Denmark. He was elected an Academician of the French Academy in 1761 and was also a member of the Academies of Dresden, Berlin, Augsburg, Vienna and Rouen."

Flemish painter and printmaker. He moved to Antwerp in 1628, and entered the studio of Gerard Seghers for eight years. In 1637 he became an Antwerp citizen and joined the Guild of St. Luke. He was in close contact with Rubens, and he, too, was involved in the execution of the Torre de la Parada compositions. That work is lost."
5329,"WILLEMS, Florent Joseph Marie","(b. 1823. Liège, d. 1905, Neuilly-sur-Seine)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/willems/biograph.html,"
Belgian painter, active in France. He trained at the Academie in Mechelen. He first exhibited in Paris at the Salon of 1840, and in 1844 he settled there, working as both a restorer and a painter. He modelled his work on that of Dutch genre painters of the 17th and 18th centuries. Willems emulated their meticulous technique, as seen especially in his depiction of silks and brocades in The Bride's Toilette (Musée d'Art Moderne, Brussels). He also adopted their subject-matter: the majority of his works are genre scenes set in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as The Widow (1850; Musée d'Art Moderne, Brussels)."
5330,"WILLEMSSENS, Lodewijk","(b. 1630, Antwerpen, d. 1702, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/willemss/biograph.html,"
Lodewijk (Ludovicus or Louis) Willemssens was a Flemish sculptor, active mainly in Antwerp. Sculptured church furniture accounted for the largest part of his production, but he made numerous statues for churches in Antwerp, Paderborn and Tournai, and also sculpted marble portrait busts."
5331,WILLIAM of Sens,"(d. 1180, Sens)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/willia/biograph.html,"

5332,"WILLIAMS, Edward Charles","(b. 1807, London, d. 1881, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/william/edward/biograph.html,"
English painter, part of the Williams family of painters, the eldest son of Edward Williams. He received his early training from his father, as can readily be seen from the similarity of their works - both painting in the same woodland style reminiscent of the early Dutch landscape artists."
5333,"WILLIAMS, George Augustus","(b. 1814, London, d. 1901, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/william/george/biograph.html,"

English painter, part of the Williams family of painters, son of George Augustus Williams, grandson of Edward Williams (1782-1855). He became a painter like his father, and married another painter Jane Pearcy (1832-1872)."
5335,"WILLIAMS, Hugh William","(b. 1773, d. 1829, Edinburgh)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/williams/biograph.html,"
Scottish painter of Welsh descent. Born aboard his father's ship during a voyage to the West Indies, he was orphaned when quite young and raised by his grandmother in Edinburgh, where he studied at Alexander Nasmyth's private drawing-school, together with David Wilkie and John Thomson of Duddingston. He became a well-known topographical painter, noted initially for such romantic watercolour views of Scotland as Cottage of the Ploughlands near Edinburgh (1814; Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow). Between 1816 and 1818 he made an extensive tour of Italy, Greece and the Greek islands, returning to Scotland to publish a two-volume book of his travels (1820). His exhibition of views of Greece held in Edinburgh in 1822 was received with enthusiasm and earned him the nickname 'Grecian' Williams."

Dutch painter and engraver. He was the pupil of Johannes Verkolje I. He painted religious scenes, history paintings, genre paintings and portraits. He was active in Delft from 1690, and he became a master portrait painter there."
5338,"WILTON, Joseph","(b. 1722, London, d. 1803, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wilton/biograph.html,"English sculptor. He trained in Flanders and with Pigalle in Paris, then was in Italy from 1747 till 1755. On his return to London he rapidly became successful, carved the state coach (still in use) for the coronation of George III (1760), and was then appointed sculptor to the King (1764). He was an intimate friend of the architect Sir William Chambers, with whom he often collaborated, and he was one of the original members of the Royal Academy. His portraits are generally regarded as his best works, his monuments showing him hesitating between various styles. Much of his work was executed by assistants. His talents were considerable, but he was more interested in social life than his work; he inherited a fortune from his father (a manufacturer of ornamental plaster) but dissipated it and became bankrupt in 1793. Considering the quality of his training and his friendship with key figures in the art world, his career is a story of wasted opportunity.



"
5339,"WIMAR, Carl","(b. 1828, Siegburg, d. 1862, Saint Louis)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wimar/biograph.html,"
American painter and photographer of German birth. When he was 15 years old he moved with his family from Germany to St. Louis, Missouri. Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, the Missouri River was the centre of America's fur trading industry. The diverse people and scenery along this route inspired numerous artists, including the young Wimar. During his years in St. Louis, he became fascinated with the Western Frontier, the Native Americans, and the objects they traded. These interests, and their inherent conflicts, become the focal point of Wimar's career."
5340,"WIND, Josef","(b. 1864, München, d. 1898, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wind/biograph.html,"

"
5341,"WINGELMÜLLER, Georg",(1810-1848),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wingelmu/biograph.html,"
Austrian architect, active in Moravia (now Czech Republic). He is known for his work at the manor house at Lednice, in southern Moravia, although he died before work was completed. His designs for the romantic Gothic Revival castle incorporated ideas from his tours of England, Scotland, Belgium, and Switzerland.



"
5342,"WINTERHALTER, Josef the Younger","(b. 1743, Vöhrenbach, d. 1807, Znojmo)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/winterha/biograph.html,"
Josef Winterhalter (or Winterhalder), painter, nephew of the sculptor Josef Winterhalter (1702-1769), both being member of a family of German artists active chiefly in Moravia. He first trained with his uncle; between c. 1763 and 1768 he was a member of the workshop of the Austrian painter Franz Anton Maulbertsch, whose views on style, colour and light exerted on him a powerful influence that was continued in his subsequent work. He was particularly noted for his frescoes and decorative schemes for churches in Moravia, and also in Hungary and Austria."
5343,"WINTERHALTER, Franz Xaver","(b. 1805, Menzenschwand, d. 1873, Frankfurt)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/winterhx/biograph.html,"
German painter, the most successful court portraitist of his period. He was based in Paris for most of his career, but he painted most of Europe's royalty and was a particular favourite of Queen Victoria, who called him 'excellent, delightful Winterhalter' (the royal collection has more than a hundred of his paintings). His style was romantic, glossy, and superficial and his portraits have until recently generally been valued more as historical records than as works of art. However, a major exhibition of his work at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Petit Palais, Paris, in 1987 brought him into the limelight again. Winterhalter was also an accomplished lithographer. His brother Hermann (1808-91) was his assistant. A watercolour by him, A Girl of Frascati (signed but until recently given to his brother), is in the Wallace Collection, London.

5344,"WIRRICH, Heinrich","(b. ca. 1515, Aarau, d. ca. 1572, Austria)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wirrich/biograph.html,"
Heinrich Wirrich was a Swiss poet. From 1544 until about the mid-1550s he was a resident in Solothurn, then in Zurich. Living a peripatetic life, he participated in court festivities as an actor and singer in southwest Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He wrote sensational stories about these events.



"
5345,"WIT, Jacob de","(b. 1695, Amsterdam, d. 1754, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wit/biograph.html,"
Jacob de Wit was the outstanding Dutch decorative painter of the 18th century, active mainly in his native Amsterdam. He had his principal training in Antwerp and learned much from Rubens's ceiling paintings in the Jesuit Church there (his drawings became valuable records after the paintings were destroyed by fire in 1718). De Wit's style, however, was much lighter than Rubens's, with a Rococo delicacy and charm. He was a Catholic and was the first Dutch artist since the 16th century to carry out a good deal of decorative work for Catholic churches, but he was at his best in domestic ceiling decorations (Bacchus and Ceres in the Clouds, Huis Bosckbeek, Heemstede, 1751). His name has entered the Dutch language to describe a kind of trompe-l'oeil imitation of marble reliefs for which he was renowned; such pictures, usually set over a chimney-piece or door, are called 'witjes ('wit' is Dutch for 'white'). De Wit was also an engraver and a noted collector of Old Master drawings.



"
5346,"WITDOECK, Jan","(b. 1615, Antwerpen, d. after 1642, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/witdoeck/biograph.html,"
Jan (Hans) Witdoeck, Flemish engraver, draughtsman and dealer. He was a pupil of the engraver Lucas Vorsterman in 1630-31 and a year later was registered as engraver and dealer in Antwerp's Guild of St Luke. He worked with the painter Cornelis Schut I until 1635 and made many engravings after Schut's work. From 1635 Witdoeck worked for Rubens, the last of the reproductive engravers to work for the great master. After Rubens's death in 1640, Witdoeck probably devoted most of his time to dealing. He married in 1642.



"
5347,"WITHOOS, Mathias","(b. 1627, Amersfoort, d. 1703, Hoorn)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/withoos/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter of landscapes, views, animals, flowers and shadowy undergrowth. According to Houbraken, his biographer, Withoos studied for six years at Jacob van Campen's school for painters at Randenbroeck, his country estate near Amersfoort. In 1648 he went to Italy with van Schrieck and Willem van Aelst and he lived in Italy between 1648 and 1652. He became a member of the Schildersbent (Dutch: ""painters' clique"") Society of Dutch and Flemish painters in Rome, which flourished from c. 1620 to 1720. The Schildersbent  was notorious for its bacchic rituals and opposition to the Roman Accademia di San Luca. "
5348,"WITMONT, Heerman","(b. ca. 1605, Delft, d. 1684, Delft)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/witmont/biograph.html,"
Dutch marine painter, trained in Amsterdam. He entered the Delft Guild in 1644. He designed cartoons for the Spiering tapestry workshop. One of Witmont's specialties were ""pen paintings"": finely detailed pen drawings in black Indian or bister ink on a canvas or panel which was first prepared with a white ground. Other well known pen painters were the Haarlem painter Hendrick Goltzius, who invented the craft, and Willem van de Velde the Elder and Willem van de Velde the Younger, both of whom specialized in seascapes. Willem van de Velde the Elder is thought to have started marine pen paintings around 1643. Willem van de Velde the Elder is mentioned in a 1653 document in which he gives his expert opinion on marine pen paintings by Witmont."
5349,"WITTE, Emanuel de","(b. 1617, Alkmaar, d. 1692, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/witte/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, active in his native Alkmaar, then in Rotterdam (by 1639), Delft (by 1641), and Amsterdam (by 1652). His range was wide, including history paintings, genre scenes (notably of markets) and portraits, but after he settled in Amsterdam he concentrated on architectural paintings (primarily church interiors, both real and imaginary)."
5350,"WITTEL, Caspar Andriaans van","(b. 1653, Amersfoort, d. 1736, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wittel/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, known in Italy as Gaspare Vanvitelli. He received his first training at Amersfoort, Holland, although he was in Rome by the time of the Jubilee of 1675. He worked as a draughtsman on a scheme for regulating the Tiber and this probably gave him the idea of making large and very accurate topographical drawings which could be worked up into 'vedute'; he therefore be the link between Dutch topographical painters like van der Heyden and later Italian 'vedutisti'. He is now recognized as an extremely important forerunner of painters like Carlevaris, Canaletto and Pannini, since there are dated Roman vedute by him of 1681."
5351,"WITTEN, Hans",(active 1485-1525 in Saxony),https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/witten/biograph.html,"
German sculptor and wood-carver. He is probably identical with Master H W the evidence of whose identity rests on three works dated between 1501 and 1512, monogrammed H W, around which a group of stylistically similar sculptures has been collected. Experts identified H W with Hans Witten on the basis of an entry in the Annaberg council records concerning the settlement of a tavern brawl in April 1511 between 'Master Balczer the painter and Hans Widenn his adversary, also a painter.' The name Hans Witten was found several times in the tax register of the priest of St Jakobi, Goslar, between 1490 and 1525, but with no indication of his profession.



"
5352,"WITTMER, Johann Michael","(b. 1802, Murnau, d. 1880, München)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wittmer/biograph.html,"
German painter who was born in northern Bavaria and trained as a goldsmith before entering the Academy in Munich in about 1820. He was a pupil of Johann Peter von Langer and Peter Cornelius, whom he assisted in painting the frescoes in the Glyptothek in about 1825. For several years he lived and worked in Italy (1828-32) before travelling in Sicily, Greece and Asia Minor. The main influences on his style were the Nazarene painters whom he met in Rome, namely Friedrich Overbeck and Johann Koch, whose daughter he married in 1838. He was essentially a history painter, but later in life he painted a number of altarpieces.



"
5353,"WITZ,Konrad","(b. ca. 1400, Rottweil, d. ca. 1445, Basel)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/witz/biograph.html,"
German-born painter from Rottweil in Swabia, active in Switzerland and generally considered a member of the Swiss school. He entered the painters' guild in Basle in 1434 and apparently spent the rest of his career there and in Geneva. Little else is known of him and few paintings by him survive. These few, however, show that he was remarkably advanced in his naturalism, suggesting a knowledge of the work of his contemporaries Jan van Eyck and the Master of Flémalle. In place of the soft lines and lyrical qualities of International Gothic we find in Witz's work heavy, almost stumpy, figures, whose ample draperies emphasize their solidity.

"
5354,"WOENSAM, Anton von Worms","(b. ca. 1495, Worms, d. 1541, Köln)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/woensam/biograph.html,"
German woodcutter and painter. His family settled in Cologne c. 1510, and he was probably trained by his father, Jaspar Woensam the Elder, who became the banneret of the painters' guild in 1546. There is evidence that Anton Woensam worked as a woodcutter for book printers in 1517-18. His style was at first influenced by Cologne painting and Antwerp Mannerism, and he may also have been inspired by the Master of St Severin. Later he was influenced by Bartolomäus Bruyn the Elder, Joos van Cleve and Albrecht Dürer.


"
5355,"WOLF, Ebert the Younger","(b. ca. 1560, Hildesheim, d. 1609, Hildesheim)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolf/biograph.html,"
German sculptor, part of a family of sculptors. There are many name variants: Ebert (Eberhard, Eckbert) Wolf (Wolff, Wulff) the Younger. Members of the family were Ebert Wolf the Elder (c. 1537-c. 1607) and his three sons, Ebert the Younger, Hans (c. 1570-before 1641), and Jonas (died 1619). All members of the family worked on the furnishing of the palace at Bückeburg."
5356,"WOLFF, Albert","(b. 1814, Neustrelitz, d. 1892, Berlin)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolff/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. The son of the Neustrelitz sculptor and master builder Christian Philipp Wolff (b 1772), he went to Berlin in 1831 to study at the Akademie and subsequently gained acceptance in the studio of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch, a friend of his father's. He worked in Rauch's studio for 15 years, helping with the execution of the bronze figure group of Polish Princes (1828-41; Poznan, Cathedral), the statues of Victories for Leo von Klenze's Valhalla in Munich (e.g. Victory Throwing a Garland, marble, 1841; Berlin, Nationalgalerie), and the marble sarcophagus for Queen Frederica of Hannover (1841-47; in situ) in the Herrenhausen, Hannover."
5357,"WOLFF, Emil","(b. 1802, Berlin, d. 1879, Roma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolff_e/biograph.html,"
German sculptor. He was the nephew and student of Johann Gottfried Schadow. Active in Rome, he worked with Rudolf (Ridolfo) Schadow and Bertel Thorvaldsen, whose influence is felt throughout his work. Wolff received significant commissions from both the Prussian and British monarchies; the Royal Collection houses numerous of his works including his magnificent statue of Prince Albert (1846).



"
5358,"WOLFF, Jacob I","(b. 1546, Bamberg, d. 1612, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolff_j/biograph.html,"
German architect, part of a family of architect-masons. Jakob Wolff I and his eldest son, Jakob Wolff II, both helped to develop the late Renaissance style, particularly in Nuremberg, where their most important projects were undertaken for the city authorities. Jakob Wolff I's younger son Hans Wolff was also active in Nuremberg, where he worked mainly with his brother."
5359,"WOLFFORT, Artus","(b. 1581, Antwerpen, d. 1641, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolffort/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter. The year he was born his parents left Antwerp for Dordrecht, where Artus became a master in 1603. He returned to Antwerp c. 1615, initially as an assistant of Otto van Veen in whose house he was living. He executed a number of commissioned altarpieces, such as the Ascension and the Assumption of the Virgin (both c. 1617; Antwerp, St Paul). Most of his oeuvre, however, consists of compositions, usually with life-size figures, intended for the open market or private individuals. These are mainly scenes from the Life of Christ and other religious subjects, as well as mythological themes."
5360,"WOLGEMUT, Michael","(b. 1434, Nürnberg, d. 1519, Nürnberg)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolgemut/biograph.html,"German painter and woodcut designer, active in his native Nuremberg. In 1472 he married the widow of Hans Pleydenwurff and took over his workshop, the most prosperous in the city. It produced numerous large altarpieces in which there is little sign of a distinctive individual personality, and Wolgemut is more important for his book illustrations. Amongst many other books he illustrated was Hartman Schedel's Weltchronik (1493), the most enterprising attempt of its time at combining letterpress with woodcut illustration. Hitherto woodcuts had often been embellished by illumination, but Wolgemut tried to refine the technique of woodcut so that it could achieve its own proper effects without hand painting. His pupils included Dürer.


"
5361,"WOLMUT, Bonifaz","(b. ca. 1510,Überlingen, Lake Constance, d. 1579, Praha)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wolmut/biograph.html,"
German architect. During his apprenticeship he travelled in Germany and Hungary, and from 1522 he worked at the Stephansdom, Vienna. After 1530 he was involved in fortification works and the construction of the Vienna Hofburg (Schweizer Hof). In 1534, after the death of Benedikt Ried, he applied unsuccessfully for the post of court architect in Prague. From 1539 he was in the service of King (later Emperor) Ferdinand I. In 1547, as a guild-master, he was granted the freedom of the city of Vienna, and with Augustin Hirschvogel he drew up the town plan, one of the most important sources for the history of Vienna. In 1548 Wolmut worked for private patrons in Vienna, and in 1559 he was appointed imperial architect. He stayed in Prague after leaving the imperial service in 1566, but was later readmitted to it. After his definitive retirement in 1570 Wolmut settled in Prague, where he was granted citizenship in 1571."

English architect and town planner (byname Wood of Bath). He established the physical character of the resort city of Bath. Wood the Elder transformed Bath by adapting the town layout to a sort of Roman plan, emphasizing the processional aspect of social life during the period. Though some of his individual buildings were noteworthy exercises in Palladianism (a kind of 16th-century Italian Renaissance classicism), he was most highly regarded for his planning of streets and groups of houses as visual units."
5363,"WOOD, John the Younger","(b. 1728, Bath, d. 1782, Batheaston)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wood/son/biograph.html,"
English architect, son of John Wood the Elder. His work at Bath represents the culmination of the Palladian tradition initiated there by his father. Bath is one of the most celebrated achievements in comprehensive town design."
5364,"WOODWARD, Thomas","(b. 1801, Pershore, d. 1852, Worcester)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/woodward/biograph.html,"
English painter. His childish efforts at painting meeting with encouragement from Benjamin West, he was articled to Abraham Cooper, and from 1822 until his death was a large exhibitor at the Royal Academy and British Institution, chiefly of historical compositions, in which horses formed a prominent feature."
5365,"WOOLNER, Thomas","(b. 1825, Hadleigh, Suffolk, d. 1892, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/woolner/biograph.html,"
English sculptor and poet. He ranks with John Henry Foley as the leading sculptor of mid-Victorian England. He trained with William Behnes (1795-1864) and in 1842 enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy, London. In 1844 he exhibited at Westminster Hall, London, a life-size plaster group, the Death of Boadicea (destroyed), in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain sculptural commissions for the Houses of Parliament. His earliest important surviving work is the statuette of Puck (plaster, 1845-47; private collection), which was admired by William Holman Hunt and helped to secure Woolner's admission in 1848 to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The work's Shakespearean theme and lifelike execution, stressing Puck's humorous malice rather than traditional ideal beauty, made it highly appealing."
5366,"WOOTTON, John","(b. ca. 1682, Warwicks, d. 1764, London)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wootton/biograph.html,"
English landscape and sporting painter. He probably received some instruction from Jan Wyck in the 1690s, and he was possibly patronized from an early age by the aristocratic households of Beaufort and Coventry (as was Wyck), perhaps while working as a page to Lady Anne Somerset at Snitterfield House, Warwicks. His earliest extant dated work is the horse portrait Bonny Black (1711; Belvoir Castle, Leics). By this time he had begun to establish himself in London. He was a subscriber to the first English Academy of Painting and Drawing in 1711 and by 1717 had been elected a steward of the Virtuosi Club of St Lukes.

5367,"WORLIDGE, Thomas","(b. 1700, Peterborough, d. 1766, Hammersmith)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/worlidge/biograph.html,"
English painter and etcher. He took drawing lessons from the Genoese painter Alessandro Maria Grimaldi (1659-1732), and with Grimaldi's son Alexander (1714-1800) he went c. 1736 to Birmingham, where he worked as a glass painter. He married Grimaldi's daughter, Arabella, and moved to London in the mid-1730s. He lived in Covent Garden and while there became acquainted with the engraver Louis Pierre Boitard (d. 1758)."
5368,"WOUTERS, Frans","(b. 1612, Lier, d. 1659, Antwerpen)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wouters/biograph.html,"
Flemish painter and dealer. He was apprenticed to Pieter van Avont and then in 1634 moved to Rubens's studio, where he may have worked on the decorations for the Pompa introitus Ferdinandi. In 1634/35 he became a master in Antwerp's Guild of St Luke and shortly afterwards entered the service of Emperor Ferdinand II in Vienna. In spring 1637, however, he was in England, working on various commissions for Charles I, including ceiling paintings with mythological themes. At the same time he executed a number of small landscapes with figures and must also have been in contact with van Dyck."
5369,"WOUWERMAN, Philips","(b. 1619, Haarlem, d. 1688, Haarlem)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wouwerma/philips/biograph.html,"
The most celebrated member of a family of Dutch painters from Haarlem, where he worked virtually all his life. He became a member of the painters' guild in 1640 and is said by a contemporary source to have been a pupil of Frans Hals. The only thing he has in common with Hals, however, is his nimble brushwork, for he specialized in landscapes of hilly country with horses - cavalry skirmishes, camps, hunts, travellers halting outside an inn, and so on. In this genre he was immensely prolific and also immensely successful."
5370,"WOUWERMAN, Pieter","(b. ca. 1623, Haarlem, d. ca. 1682, Amsterdam)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wouwerma/pieter/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter. He was one of the sons of the painter Paulus [Pauwels] Joostens Wouwerman of Alkmaar (d. 1642). His brother wwas the more famous Philips Wouwerman. Another brother, Jan Wouwerman (1629-1666) was also painter. The brothers were specialists of battle and hunting scenes.

Joachim Wtewael (or Uytewael), Dutch figure painter. After travelling in Italy and France c.1588-92, he settled in his native Utrecht, where he became one of the leading Dutch exponents of Mannerism. His highly distinctive, charmingly artificial style, which remained untouched by the naturalistic developments happening around him, was characterized by acidic colours and elegant figures in wilfully distorted poses. In his progress from northern Italy to Rome, Paris, and Fontainebleau, he gained a sophisticated understanding of an international style, which had been brought up-to-date in Utrecht by Abraham Bloemaert and by the example of the Haarlem Mannerists, in particular Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem. The best collection of Wtewael's work, including a self-portrait (1601), is in the Centraal Museum, Utrecht.

5375,"WTEWAEL, Peter","(b. 1596, Utrecht, d. 1660, Utrecht)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/w/wtewael/peter/biograph.html,"
Dutch painter, the comparatively obscure son of the Utrecht Mannerist Joachim Wtewael and elder brother to the painter Johan Wtewael (1598-1652). He appears to have studied only with his father, and also shared his business concerns and interest in politics. In September 1635, at the age of thirty-nine, he joined the Reformed Church, which allowed him to assume his aged father's position at the City Council in October 1636. In 1642, he took over his deceased brother-in-law's seat as a court magistrate and served for many years. He also became a deacon and elder in his church. Like his younger brother, Johan, Peter Wtewael remained a bachelor, and lived in his parents' house in Utrecht. Johan registered in the painters' guild in 1639, a year after his father's death, but Peter never bothered to do so."

English architect, part of a family of architects, painters, and sculptors. The most well known member of the Wyatt family, James was the son of Benjamin Wyatt. His father sent him to train as an architect and draftsman in Italy when he was still young. He returned to England in 1768 where he worked with his father and five brothers, and was heavily influenced by the work of Robert Adam. He achieved his fame as the architect and designer of the Pantheon in Oxford Street, London (1769-1772). Thereafter, he received numerous commissions and held several official positions. He was also an eclectic and versatile designer, versed in a wide range of artistic styles."

English architect, second cousin of Samuel Wyatt (1737-1807) and James Wyatt. One of the most prolific of English architects, he trained in London at the office of Philip Hardwick (1792-1870) before starting independent architectural practice in 1832. Through the influence of an uncle who was land agent to the extensive Beaufort estates in South Wales, he obtained most of the commissions for the large numbers of new public buildings required in the development of the Welsh valleys. With the recommendation of the Beauforts he started a country-house practice that grew to be one of the largest in England. Between 1838 and 1851 he was in partnership with David Brandon (1813-1897), but he later worked on his own."

His family connections allowed him to be made secretary to the British Consulate in Calais. The diplomatic life however did not interest him and he joined forces with one of his friends Johan Lewis Brown, who was active in commerce and they worked as wine merchants exporting champagne from Epernay to England. Wyld spent his spare time drawing and painting with his friend and travelling from Dieppe to Rouen painting French genre scenes. In Rouen he met Horace Vernet, at the height of his fame, and who was to become an important influence on his work."

He is famous as one of the architects and builders of Saint Basil's Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow. In cooperation with another master, Ivan Shirlai, designed the walls of the Kazan Kremlin and the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Kazan in 1561 and 1562, just after the completion of St. Basil's. In 1588, he also designed the northeast chapel of St. Basil's (where Basil himself is buried).

Fernando Yáñez (or Yáñez de la Almedina), Spanish painter. He is first documented in 1506 in Valencia, where in 1507-10 he collaborated with Fernando de los Llanos in painting twelve panels of the Life of the Virgin for the main altarpiece of the cathedral. From the style of these paintings it is inferred that the 'Fernando spagnuolo' who in 1505 was working with Leonardo da Vinci on the Battle of Anghiari was either Yáñez or Llanos. Yáñez is credited with being the more gifted artist and one of the most important influences in introducing the High Renaissance style to Spain. Examples of his work are in the museum at Valencia and the Prado in Madrid.

English architect. He is first recorded in 1353, when he was granted the freedom of the City of London. He quickly rose to prominence and c. 1357 he was appointed mason to Edward, Prince of Wales (1330-1376). The title of King's Deviser of Masonry, which he held from 1360 to his death, indicates that he was recognized as an architect in the modern sense, with responsibility for design, erection and maintenance of all Crown works. Project include Queenborough Castle (1361-1367; destroyed 1650), Rochester Castle (repaired 1367-1368), parts of the London Charterhouse (contracted 1371), and John of Gaunt's chantry (1374-ca. 1378; destroyed 1666) for Old St. Paul's Cathedral in London."

According to his own declaration (1641), Ykens travelled in Provence after his apprenticeship, staying at Aix and Marseille. In 1635 he married Catarina Ykens-Floquet who was born in Antwerp as the daughter of Lucas Floquet. She was a still-life painter sometimes confused with Catharina Ykens, the sister of Peter Ykens. Frans Ykens purchased a house in 1651 and made a will in 1666."

He studied under Paul Delaroche at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and had three religious compositions accepted for the Salon of 1841: St Paul in Prison, Christ's Expulsion of the Money-changers (both untraced) and the Remorse of Judas (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Le Havre). Yvon's début attracted some critical attention, and his canvases were purchased for the State; but he was more interested in depicting the exotic worlds popularised by artists like Alexandre Decamps and Prosper Marilhat."
5393,"ZACCAGNI, Bernardino","(b. ca. 1460, Rivalta, d. 1530, Parma)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zaccagni/biograph.html,"
Italian architect from Rivalta (near Torrechiara). Architecture in Parma was dominated by the personality of Zaccagni. He is credited with designing the church of Madonna della Steccata in Parma, although the modernity of its centralized plan has led some to suggest that it was actually Bramante's invention. As a way of explaining the presence of a building of such refinement in a city which was by all accounts peripheral, it has also been hypothesized that the Parmese architect may have been inspired by a major artist such as Leonardo. Zaccagni, with the assistance of his Gianfrancesco, worked at the Steccata until he and his son were dismissed in 1525."
5394,"ZACCHIA, Lorenzo","(b. 1524, Lucca, d. ca. 1587)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zacchia/giovane/biograph.html,"
Lorenzo Zacchia il Giovane, Italian painter and engraver. He was a cousin of the Lucchese painter Ezechia da Vezzano, known as Zacchia il Vecchio, who probably brought him up and from whom he learnt to paint in the Florentine High Renaissance style. However, his Adoration of the Shepherds (1576; Museo e Pinacoteca Nazionale, Lucca) is in an obviously mature style that owes something to the Mannerist compositions of Bronzino, particularly to his altarpiece (1564) on the same subject for San Stefano dei Cavalieri, Pisa. Two other reliably datable works, from the 1580s, feature typical Counter-Reformation themes: a Virgin and Child with SS Louis and John the Evangelist (1585; San Paolino, Lucca) and a Crucifixion with SS Lawrence and Julian (1587; Sant'Anastasio, Lucca). Lorenzo treated these subjects in a style closer to that of Zacchia il Vecchio and Fra Bartolomeo.

Their first known joint work was the Virgin and Child Enthroned with SS John the Baptist and Florian and Three Angels (signed and dated 1499; Milan, Pinacoteca di Brera). Their last, the Holy Family (1509; Bergamo, Galleria Accademia Carrara), is unusual in the prominence accorded to St Joseph. The fan-shaped trees that rise above the wooded landscape in this painting are also found in the one work definitely assigned solely to Bernardino, St Sebastian (signed and dated 1506; London, National Gallery, together with the original lunette)."

Italian painter, also called Francesco da Cotignola. He was possibly a pupil of Marco Palmezzano in Forlí. He primarily studied Ferrarese painting, which permeates his oeuvre and may account for certain eccentricities of style. He shared a workshop in Cotignola with his brother Bernardino Zaganelli. Their first known joint work was the Virgin and Child Enthroned with SS John the Baptist and Florian and Three Angels (signed and dated 1499; Milan, Pinacoteca di Brera).

Danish painter (full name: Peder Henrik Kristian Zahrtmann). He was a part of the Danish artistic generation in the late 19th century, along with Peder Severin Krøyer and Theodor Esbern Philipsen, who broke away from both the strictures of traditional Academicism and the heritage of the Golden Age of Danish Painting, in favour of naturalism and realism."
5399,"ZAIS, Giuseppe","(b. 1709, Canale d'Agordo, d. 1781, Treviso)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zais/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, born in Forno di Canale (now Canale d'Agordo), near Belluno. He may have served an apprenticeship in Belluno before moving, probably around 1725-30, to Venice, where he practised as a landscape painter for nearly 50 years. The first and most important influence on his art was that of Marco Ricci, also from Belluno, who was in Venice from 1717 until his death in 1729. Ricci's etchings, published in 1730, provided Zais with a useful source of inspiration. From them he derived the scenographic format of his landscapes, usually framed by clumps of trees into which villages and figures of peasants were inserted, painted in a thick impasto of rich colour. The result is a pleasing, simplified style of great descriptive power. However, this attractive facility can also be seen as a limitation, for Zais never achieved Ricci's dramatic effects. Zais's contact with Francesco Zuccarelli in the early 1730s softened Ricci's influence and introduced an increased refinement into his work, although sometimes at the risk of affectation.

He began his studies under Joaquín Balaca (d. c. 1820) and Federico da Madrazo (1815-1894) at the Academia de Bellas Artes in Madrid, before going to Paris as a pupil of Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. Subsequently he struck up a friendship with Mariano Fortuny. He first exhibited in Madrid at the 1860 Exposición Nacional and in Paris at the 1863 Salon. He won third-class medals in 1862, 1864 and 1867."
5402,"ZANCHI, Antonio","(b. 1631, Este, d. 1722, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zanchi/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. His first teacher was Giacomo Pedrali (d 1660), whose influence, however, is not discernible in Zanchi's work. At an early age he travelled to Venice to study under Matteo Ponzone (1580/90-1664). The latter's style, which was influenced by Tintoretto, played a limited role in his development; the influence of Francesco Ruschi (active 1643-56), originally from Rome and also active in Venice, Vicenza and Treviso, was more important during the artist's formative years. The plasticity of the figures and the hard, almost metallic fall of the folds in the drapery that characterize his first known works, a series of etched frontispieces for opera librettos (earliest 1655: La Statira by G. F. Busenello), are certainly indebted to Ruschi. The few paintings by Zanchi that can be dated to the 1650s, such as the Entry into Jerusalem (Padua, Casa di Pena), also display similarities to Ruschi but at the same time betray a great interest in the early work of Luca Giordano and in Giovanni Battista Langetti, who had come from Genoa and worked in Venice."

Italian painter. His father Pietro and grandfather Luigi tried to interest him in the plastic arts, but from a very early age he showed a stronger inclination for painting. Zandomeneghi soon rebelled against their teachings, and by 1856 he was attending the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice, studying under the painters Michelangelo Grigoletti (1801-1870) and Pompeo Molmenti (1819-1894). As a Venetian he was born an Austrian subject, and, to escape conscription, he fled his city in 1859 and went to Pavia, where he enrolled at the university. In the following year he followed Garibaldi in the Expedition of the Thousand; afterwards, having been convicted of desertion and therefore unable to return to Venice, he went to Florence, where he remained from 1862 to 1866. This period was essential for his artistic development."

Anton Maria Zanetti II (Anton Maria the Younger) was an Italian draftsman, librarian, and writer. The son of Anton Maria Zanetti I's cousin, Anton[io] Maria II was a protegé of the elder Zanetti who developed into a distinguished critic; he collaborated with his elder cousin, providing most of the drawings for a sumptuously illustrated account of the classical sculpture conserved in Venetian public collections (I, Venice, 1740, II, Venice, 1743).



"
5407,ZANINO DI PIETRO,"(active 1389, Bologna, d. ca. 1448, Venezia)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zanino/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, known also as Giovanni di Francia or Giovanni di Pietro Charlier. With Niccolò di Pietro and Jacobello del Fiore, Zanino di Pietro was one of the major Venetian painters of the first quarter of the 15th century. His activity in Bologna, repeatedly documented between 1389 and 1406, was of crucial importance for the pungent narrative style and naturalistic details of his earliest signed painting, a folding Crucifixion triptych painted for the Franciscan convent of Fonte Colombo (Rieti, Museo Civico). The inscription describes the artist as h[ab]itator ve[n]eciis i[n] contrata sa[nc]te a[ppol]linaris, and it is therefore datable to c. 1405, when Zanino seems to have moved permanently to Venice. Whether the triptych reflects the work of Gentile da Fabriano, who was active in Venice by 1408, or whether Zanino was instrumental in transmitting an Emilian style to Gentile cannot be answered satisfactorily. The most important commission of his career was that of decorating the façade of the Ca d'Oro in Venice, received shortly after his completion of the pulpit in the church of the Carità in the same city."

Zaryanko first studied painting with Vasily Mikhaylovich Avrorin (1805-55), a pupil of Aleksey Venetsianov, and soon attracted the interest of Venetsianov himself, who in 1834 sent Zaryanko to the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. Along with other pupils of Venetsianov, Zaryanko painted interiors of the Winter Palace, such as View of the Field-Marshals Hall in the Winter Palace (1836) and View of the Throne Room (1838; both St. Petersburg, Hermitage)."

In 1499 he established himself at Ávila as a carver in alabaster. He was also active as an architect, and in 1508 he was involved with the reconstruction of the cloisters in Ávila Cathedral. He carved the wall tomb (c. 1515) of Archbishop Alonso Carrillo de Albornoz in the chapel of S Ildefonso, Toledo Cathedral, a work with a strong Italianate influence perhaps partly due to the presence of Domenico Fancelli in Ávila. The monument is in the form of a triumphal arch, but all surfaces are carved with a profusion of decorative motifs reminiscent of the Lombard school. In 1518 de la Zarza completed the monument to Bishop Alonso de Madrigal, known as El Tostado, in the trasaltar mayor (the area behind the altar) of Ávila Cathedral."

In Vienna he won the price of the Wiener Akademie in 1737 and he was the friend and collaborator of Paul Troger. In 1756 he returned to his native city in Tyrol from where he obtained commissions in Southern Germany. His main works are the frescoes in the churches of Fürstenzeil, Ottobeuren, and Ettal.



"
5417,"ZEINER, Lukas","(b. 1450, Zürich, d. 1519, Zürich)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zeiner/biograph.html,"
Swiss glass painter and glazier. He is recorded in the town records of Zurich between 1479 and 1512. At this time, the records are quite specific and often record glass painters like Zeiner by name rather than as simply 'glass painter'. In the 15th and 16th centuries it became more common to commission secular, heraldic, glass. It was especially common in mainland Europe, where the rules as to who could claim a coat of arms were more relaxed than in England. Zeiner was a leading glass artist in the field of heraldic painting. His style featured a coat of arms with supporters within an elaborate canopy. It set the stage for similar work for the next 100 years.

5418,"ZEITBLOM, Bartholome","(b. ca. 1457, Nördlingen, d. ca. 1520, Ulm)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zeitblom/biograph.html,"
German painter. Few details about his life are known. He is believed to have been a pupil of Martin Schongauer. Probably living in Ulm in 1482, he married a daughter of Hans Schuchlin in 1483. He collaborated with the sculptor Jörg Syrlin the Younger (c. 1455-1523) in Bingen. He and Bernhard Strigel were responsible for the two wings of the altarpiece on the high altar in the monastery of Blaubeuren near Ulm. These are painted on both sides with scenes from the Passion, the life of St John the Baptist and figures of saints. The Kilchberg Altarpiece, now in the museum in Stuttgart, is remarkable for the use made of reds and golds to portray imposing figures of St Margaret, St George, St Florian and St John. Also in Stuttgart is the Heerbengen Altarpiece painted in 1497-98 and representing the Birth of Christ and Presentation in the Temple. The Stuttgart Annunciation of 1496 is reminiscent of the work of Rogier van der Weyden."
5419,"ZELOTTI, Gian Battista","(b. c. 1526, Verona, d. 1578, Mantova)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zelotti/biograph.html,"
Italian painter. He is called Battista da Verona by Vasari, and also known as Battista Farinati. He was trained with Paolo Veronese in the workshop of Antonio Badile in Verona. Perhaps he trained also with his uncle Paolo Farinati. Much of Zelotti's work was executed for prestigious villas and palazzi in and near Vicenza. He was a contemporary of Paolo Veronese and shared work in Villa Soranza near Castelfranco (1551); in the ceiling of the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci in the Doge's Palace of Venice (1553-54); in the Biblioteca Marciana (1556-57), and Palazzo Trevisan (1557) in Murano. Zelotti came to embody the Veronese tradition in the mainland, decorating at Villa Obizzi at Catajo near Padua. Also worked in Mantua for the Gonzaga family. Along with Bernardino India and Battista Franco, he helped fresco the Palladian house called La Malcontenta or Villa Foscari."
5420,"ZENALE, Bernardo","(b. 1464, Treviglio, d. 1526, Milano)",https://www.wga.hu/bio/z/zenale/biograph.html,"
Italian painter, member of Milan's Scuola di San Luca painters' guild by 1481. He spent most of his career in Milan working on collaborations with Bernardino Butinone for the churches between 1485 and 1493. His early influences were Ferrarese painters such as Ercole de'Roberti but after c. 1500, Zenale seemed to abandon the Ferrarese-expressionist style of Butinone, a strong influence from Leonardo da Vinci starting to appear in his works. This is manifest in the polyptych that he painted for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception of Cantù (1502). He was influenced also by Bernardino Luini's style: works like the Pala Busti and the large Annunciation (both in the Pinacoteca di Brera) have indeed raised disputes about the attribution to Luini or Zenale."

Hungarian painter, graphic artist. He was a significant representative of Hungarian romantic painting. During his law studies in Pest from 1842, he attended Jakab Marastoni's school as well. In Vienna he was Waldmüller's pupil in 1844. Life Boat, his first major work, comes from this time. On Waldmüller's recommendation, he became an art teacher in St. Petersburg. He swore allegiance to freedom by painting the portrait of Lajos Batthány, the first Hungarian prime minister, in 1849. From 1850 onwards, he worked as a retoucher, but he also did pencil drawings, watercolours and portraits in oil. The series on the Gatsina hunting ordered by the Russian tsar raised him to a court artist. He founded a society to support painters in need. Autodafé on the horrors of Spanish inquisition was painted in 1868. He travelled around Europe in 1871, and settled down in Paris in 1874."

He painted numerous altarpieces and frescoes for Bruchsal Castle, the Würzburg Residenz, as well as for monasteries in Schlehdorf, Raitenhaslach, Langhaus, Biberach, Ehingen and Amberg. Though his son Januarius Zick has received considerable attention as a German painter, Johann has been somewhat neglected. Nevertheless, Johann Zick can be considered a 'minor master', rivaling Chodowiecki in anecdotal description of contemporary daily life."

From 1745 to 1748, he was apprenticed as a bricklayer to Jakob Emele in Schussenried. Having finished his apprenticeship, he worked, together with his father, at the residence of the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg and then, until the mid-1750s, at the residence of the Prince-Bishop of Speyer in Bruchsal."

He also designed the Corinthian exhibition building opposite von Klenze's more lively Glyptothek (Sculpture Gallery) in the Königsplatz, Munich (1816-31).

German graphic artist, active in Austria. He came from a poor family, and was able to study at the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna through support from Count Franz Josef Thun and owing to his Masonic connections. He is mainly known for his series of views of Vienna, ""Collection de 50 vues de la ville de Vienne"" (1779), which he created with Carl Schütz and Laurenz Janscha for the Artaria publishing house.

Born in 1821 in Beaune to a Croatian father and French mother, he initially studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Dijon until he was expelled in 1838 for unruly behaviour. In 1839 he left for Marseille, where he was Clerk of Works on the construction of the Marseille canal. In November 1839 he was noticed by Ferdinand Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, who accepted two watercolours that Ziem presented to him and commissioned a further six. This first success decided Ziem's vocation, and he started a drawing class that was attended by Louis Auguste Laurent Aiguier (1819-1865) and Adolphe Monticelli. During this period he also encountered the Provençal artists Emile Loubon (1809-1863), Prosper Grésy (1804-1874) and Gustave Ricard (1823-1873)."

The Marchese Andrea Gerini took him under his protection from an early age, sending him to Rome, Bologna, Milan and Venice to continue his studies. In Venice Zocchi saw engravings of views by Michele Marieschi and Bernardo Bellotto and painted a small oval portrait of Andrea Gerini and Antonio Maria Zanetti (1750 or 1751; Venice, Correr). Zanetti was a Venetian connoisseur and a friend of Gerini.

Italian painter (originally Marco di Ruggero). The earliest dated notice of Zoppo is an agreement of 24 May 1455 concerning his legal adoption by the Paduan painter Francesco Squarcione. The document indicates that at the time it was drawn up Zoppo had been living in Squarcione's house for about two years and at 23 years old was already recognized as a painter of considerable ability. According to the agreement, Squarcione, who was childless and had recently become a widower, acknowledged Zoppo as his sole heir in return for Zoppo's work in painting. The contract, however, was short-lived. By October of the same year, Zoppo had left Squarcione and was living in Venice. Two documents record the terms by which the adoption agreement was to be annulled and the arrangements drawn up not only to compensate Zoppo for work he had executed for which Squarcione had received payment, but also to cover Squarcione's costs for having provided Zoppo with lodging and artists' materials. Clearly Zoppo quickly discovered that the conditions placed on him by Squarcione were not to his advantage. Like other young artists who came into contact with Squarcione, most notably Andrea Mantegna, who had a similar experience in the late 1440s, Zoppo soon realized that his success as an artist rested on gaining his freedom, even though this could be achieved only by relinquishing his rights to Squarcione's substantial estate."

From 1689 he studied in the workshop of the Armoury in Moscow and from 1699 under the engraver Adriaan Schoonebeeck. He then worked in the engraving department of the Armoury. In 1711 he moved to St Petersburg, and until 1727 he was in charge of the engraving department of the St Petersburg Printing Office. This was the most brilliant and fruitful period of his career. His work marks a high point in printmaking in Petrine Russia. He was a skilled draughtsman, and nearly always worked from his own designs. He was equally successful in a variety of genres: he engraved views of St Petersburg, battles, firework displays, triumphal processions, allegorical compositions, maps and book illustrations. His techniques included etching, engraving and mezzotint. He produced over 100 sheets in all.

Spanish Basque painter. He studied in Paris in 1891, coming under the influence of Impressionism and of the group of Catalan painters around Santiago Rusinol. His visit to Andalusia in 1892 provided the key to his later work, leading him to replace the grey tonalities of his Paris paintings with more brightly coloured images of Spanish folkloric subjects and of male or female figures in regional dress, for example Merceditas (1911/13; Washington, National Gallery of Art). Zuloaga turned to Castilian subjects in works such as Segoviano and Toreros de Pueblo (both 1906; both Madrid, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo) after the defeat suffered by Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898; like the group of writers known as the 'Generation of '98', with whom he was associated and who were among his most articulate supporters, he sought to encourage the regeneration of his country's culture but with a critical spirit."

He was brought up in Llerena in the prosperous household of his father and stepmother, Dona Beatriz de Morales, and he was later trained by his father in Seville. Although he is known to have painted religious works on commission, Juan de Zurbarán seems to have specialized in still-lifes, for his only certain works are in this genre. Socially he was somewhat pretentious, partial to such courtly pastimes as the dance, and using the aristocratic 'Don' when signing his name.
